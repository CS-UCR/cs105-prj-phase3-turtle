YOU HAVE TO BUY LOCKER TIME TO STORE YOUR THINGS**BRING SUNSCREEN!!!It's expensive ( of course)Bathrooms have no paper towels Free water bottle refill stations On a personal note... I don't like it. I know they ""rescue"" them but it just seems the areas they live in are so small and confined. A little kid was jumping excitedly when the dolphins were playing. That was so heartwarming, I guess most people will only see a dolphin, whale and orcas this way, including myself. Enjoy"
1,2/21/2020,4,Family went on a weekday which was wonderful and not crowded. The park is very clean and working staff extremely friendly. The shows were entertains and a favorite were the interactive tide pools were we were allowed to touch live marine animals. Food was as expected but watch out for the birds! If food is loosely attended they will steal it all!We will be back!
2,2/1/2020,5,"We always have a great time. Â We have season passes and frequent quite often, about 3-6 times a month.Today was busier then other Saturday's but by no means is it busy compared to other theme parks! It took maybe 15 minutes for my husband and friend of ours to ride the Manta.The Sesame Street kids area is always a mandatory stop with my toddler. There were about 15 - 20 kids in the small bouncy area with blocks. Â I wish they'd add some more so the kids can have more to play with or build. Â It's essentially a mini mosh pit some days with kids just stealing each other's blocks. Â I will say in all the times we've been I have only seen kids be ""mean"" a handful of times.We dined with orcas today and it was yummy. Â It's a buffet with a mini show. Â Orcas weren't too cooperative today but if you aren't familiar with their mini show you wouldn't know. Â They have complimentary soft drinks and alcoholic beverages are an additional price. Â If you're a pass holder make sure to put that in so you get an additional discount. Â We paid $36/per adult and both kids are under three so they are free!We love going to SeaWorld and a pass is sooooooo worth it!!!"
3,1/3/2020,5,"Considering I live in San Diego this is pretty much the only amusement park that is close to home excluding the World Famous San Diego Zoo and the Safari Park.Since I have an annual pass to all amusement parks, I try my best to get my money's worth by frequenting the turnstiles as often as I can. Gas isn't getting any cheaper so Disneyland is no longer an option at least for the foreseeable future. Â Therefore Sea World is best for my pocket and my car.I've come to love this place. With constant efforts to reinvent themselves and attract more and more visitors, there is always something new in the mix.Parking is easy to get in and out of.Entering the gates is quick even with the security checks which now have metal detectors.Attractions are endless and entertaining. Food is good and reasonably priced.Restrooms are always clean and nearby.Lines are never long.They even have family restrooms and designated change rooms for families with infants! I for the first time was able to use one and was thankful it was available. I've been coming here for decades and have never been disappointed. Looking forward to my next visit to try their All Day Dining Option. Â Let me know what I should try and where I should visit. Thank you in advance. SYOY!"
4,12/7/2019,4,"Sea world is adding more rides, attractions Â and coasters to the park to compliment the sea life exhibits within the park. Â The latest coasters is a high intensity, inverted launch coaster and a bobsled like figure eight shaped banking coaster. Â  We loved the rides. Â Manta coaster is still a favorite ride of many and maximizes thrill fun with the space and height restrictions given. Â The new rides are a great welcomed addition to the amusement park and Sesame Street has great kitty rides. Â  There is plenty to do at the park for both kids and adults. Â The dolphin show and cirque de sole are among the best shows. Â Putting hands into the Feeder fish pools are a must try for us. Â The food was good at the calypso bbq restaurant and we enjoyed a bbq sampler plate. Â Beer and wine are readily available at food kiosks and restaurants. Â The craft beer selection on draft was appreciated. Â Sea world is transforming and has more and more fun things to do each year. Â Friendly staff and interesting sea Â life top off the fantastic experience. We love Sea World and will be back. Â Great job!"
5,1/1/2020,4,"Great place to chill with family and see animals! The paper map offered at the entrance of the park is detailed enough to navigate around and I never got lost.All the shows and animals were enjoyable to see. The dolphin and sea lion show is a must to see if you love to see fun flips, tricks, and much more. Around 6-8 hours is definitely enough to see all animals and major shows.Just like all big parks, food prices are marked up. Most of the food isn't good quality either, so I recommend bringing simple snacks to eat instead. I ordered from a steakhouse and most of the meat was overcooked or burnt.All in all, I think it's worth to check out SeaWorld if you and your family/friends love animals."
6,12/1/2019,4,"I've been too a couple of Sea Worlds, and we've been here quite a bit since moving too California. While we came after a stormy week so not many people at all, the staff and employees were still very attentive, and helpful.Facilities were well kept, and if you are going to be here all day I would suggest getting the ""Dine all Day"" package which lets you dine every hour! Worth the money if not for food, just for water and drinks alone. The shows were great as usual, we did the orca, dolphin, and a otter show."
7,3/1/2020,5,"When you come to Sea World, look for Ben! He's hilarious and so knowledgeable! He deserves a raise, and he supports penguins! On top of that, he might just give you some stock advice! GOOOOOO BENNNNNN!!!!"
8,2/25/2020,5,I love bringing my children here. It's never super crowded and you cannot beat the price of the annual pass. I would take advantage of that if you live in the area. Great educational shows that still showcase the talents & intelligence of the animals.
9,2/28/2020,5,This place was so fun! Great way to spend my 30th birthday! Thankfully it was a week day so there were no crowds!!
10,2/28/2020,5,LOVE THIS PLACE. I love the fact that they rescue and rehabilitate these animals. People need to get off their soap box and look again at what amazing things they do. They have so many veterinarians that take care of these animals. Many of these animals are happy there and if you don't like it don't go. Keep your awful opinions to yourself and quit trying to ruin this place and other people's experiences. Sea World deserves to stay
11,1/6/2020,5,"We love Seaworld! We love it so much that we get season passes every single year. It is really close to where we live so on weekdays there is actually hardly any line and it is quick to park and get in and have a couple hours of fun. During the holidays they had an amazing Christmas village complete with Mr. and Mrs. Claus to take pictures with!I think it's the best for kids between the ages of 4- 10 but it's also a blast for adults. They are increasing the amount of attractions for grown-ups as well including new roller coasters and water rides. Â If you buy a year pass you also get a discount on things that you buy in the shop and at the concession stands so it's definitely worth it. on a related note, I see a lot of articles in the newspaper talking about how Seaworld really is a great part of our San Diego community. They are always saving little creatures from the sea and our beaches. Keep up the great work Seaworld!"
12,1/15/2020,1,"Bleh. Â Seaworld should honestly just close commercial aspects and focus primarily on the animals and research. Â SeaWorld as an entertainment park was very underwhelming. Â Many of the attractions were closed and the shows even though times were printed in their daily handout, they would change the times. Â It made it very difficult to plan your day and if you like to maximize your time in the park you will have a hard time doing that here.What makes me the most upset is what happened to my parents when they were grabbing food from the Calypso Bay Smokehouse. Â So Calypso Bay Smokehouse is a cafeteria style food service where you get a tray and pick up items they have on the line. Â As one of the only places for food open, there naturally was a long line since your food options were VERY limited. Â After about 45 minutes in line, my parents get to the front and while looking at their options they asked the staff if mac - n - cheese was available. Â They responded, not for another 20 minutes. Â (right after they finished going through the line, they replaced the mac n cheese)Then my mom had asked for ""The Brisket Sampler"" and she got an irritated response from the staff, ""THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE"". Â My mom had already looked at that plate and she said it looked disgusting and questioned why they would even serve that.She had politely asked if they would serve her another Brisket Sampler and the same worker said, ""Ma'am there's one right there"" as she's holding another Brisket Sampler in her hand but wouldn't give it to my mom.To the workers of Seaworld, if you dislike your job or do not want to be there, then please quit. Â To Sea World Management, if this is the type of product you put out, just pack it all up and close down."
13,1/26/2020,5,This is a great park with a lot of attractions and great pricing. Unlike Disney it has easy access to and from the highway and you can park right next to the entrance so you don't have to walk for miles like the other theme parks. They have upgraded the Orca show which is very informative. The Christmas and holiday attractions and food are great. I would definately recommend this park for families and friends.
14,9/14/2019,3,"So excited to finally visit the granddaddy of all Sea Worlds where had only been to the one in San Antonio. We arrived by Lyft to end up getting stuck in traffic at the parking lot entrance where there was no dedicated ride sharing/drop off lane. After a long wait we were dropped off in front but the pickup is located somewhere else in the parking lot with poor signage. I had purchased passes online (recommended) and upgraded to Quick Queue Premier to save cost and avoid a line. There are many sea life animals to see and rides to enjoy. Â For some reason you had to pay to go up the Skytower Ride to enjoy Sea World from above. Â There were plenty of shops and hands on contact with animals. The one I most enjoyed was the tank full of Garra rufa fish where you could stick your hands in and let these tiny carp eat off your dead skin basically cleaning your hands (no feet please).Sea World has changed dramatically where Shamu no longer performs, poor food quality, unfriendly employees, and unmaintained sections of the park. I found it here the same as in SA. I noticed some rides were shutdown where this was July 4th week and expect everything operational. It's seems like the park focused on only entertaining the little kids except there are a few rides for the teenagers. Since I had Quick Queue Premier this allowed me to cut the line, but for some rides it did not matter especially in the morning.I was not impressed with the Penguin Encounter where it was so dark you could not see the penguins and the glass was so filthy and even if the lights were on you still would not see them. I also kept overhearing parents telling to their kids how the orcas used to jump out of the water entertaining guests by getting them wet and seeing the trainers fly in the air. Â When I was a kid Shamu was the reason people went to Sea World.This location has a smaller footprint but packed with lots to see and easy to walk around. Â There are rides and educational sea life exhibits, and everything is stepped up compared to the SA location. The weather is great and gets chilly at night so bring a light cover to enjoy to night performances. And if you are looking for Aquatica then it is located at another location in San Diego where it is much warmer."
15,12/8/2019,4,"We were able to get BOGO free tickets because of Black Friday, so we saved on the cost of entry. Between parking, souvenirs, and food/drinks we made up for what we saved. We didn't know that the only way to see the orcas was to see a show, so we missed out on that. We did get to see the dolphins though, and that was a cute short show. The sharks were pretty cool with an underground tunnel where they swim over you. My toddler wasn't a fan of it, but it's a great way to see all the teeth sharks have. The penguin exhibit has a slow moving sidewalk so you can see them walking/swimming, but it's not a large exhibit. I know they have more hands-on experiences, but with a 2-yo, there wasn't a whole lot we could do. You can bring your own food and drinks, and I wish we had done more of that."
16,12/22/2019,3,"We had a nice time at SeaWorld! In a single day, we managed to see all the shows, go on most of the rides, and visit most of the animal exhibits. Just make sure that you plan your day accordingly, taking the showtimes into consideration -- we arrived at most of the shows 15-30 minutes before they started and there was plenty of seating, but a few of the holiday themed evening shows filled up very quickly. Pro-tip: if you sit toward the back of the ""splash zone"", there is a high chance you will not get wet and you will enjoy one of the best views of the show. In my opinion, the animal shows are the best part of SeaWorld. The dolphin, orca, and sea lion shows are very well done, more educational than what I remember, but still entertaining. Some of the evening shows, particularly the Cirque Christmas show, were a little bit anticlimactic and not really worth the wait, since you have to get there pretty early (30+ minutes before) to get a good seat/get a seat at all. Some of the things I didn't really like about the park is first, navigating, especially after dark. Following the map got pretty confusing (I made more than my fair share of wrong turns) and although they have some signs posted indicating where to go, they are few and far between. More lighting after dark would also be helpful. Second, I know this is to be expected at theme parks, but the price of food/drink is a little insane. $10 for a hot dog?? Just bring your own food/snacks into the park. Overall though, we had a good day seeing all the different aquatic animals, and being there during the holidays was nice; you avoid the sweltering heat and large crowds."
17,2/8/2020,1,"Attractions were closed, and the whales looked very unhappy to be in the tanks. They all had collapsed dorsal Â fins from not being able to swim like they should be. Sea world should be ashamed of themselves for separating whales and keeping them in small tanks. I suggest you guys watch Blackfish on Netflix."
18,1/7/2020,5,"I love seaworld and have been an annual pass holder for many many years with no plans to stop. They have great events all throughout the yr. They do stuff for Chinese new yr, a summer concert series, Halloween bash and christmas event with pop up food booths ect. My fave ride is Atlantis and sometimes ride it over and over. I also love the skyride bit hate that it closes early as its relaxing to go on at night. The food is mediocre. I usually get the chicken tender from pineapple petes and everytime I say never again yet I still order it. So maybe I do like it.There is 1 cart type ride over by the new childrens section that has never worked. I havent wanted to go on it for a few urs now and always closed, so that's super disappointing. I'm also bummed they closed a lot of the aquariums. I do enjoy seaworld but hate that the sealife is all leaving."
19,1/5/2020,3,We came here for the first time (have lived in town 13 years) when we had family in town for the holiday. We came on a Friday and have gold passes. Â It was a pain to get into the parking lot (long lines and one employee working 2 lines). Â Then they have you drive forever to park. Â Then you have to walk to the gate.After you go through security you either can buy your ticket on the self service kiosks or wait and talk with a live human. Â We were able to get 2 of our gold passes on the kiosks and the free tickets but 2 of our gold card pass holders could not print their ticket and it would not work in the app so we had to go to the line. Â It was about a 20 minute wait. Â They took mine and my toddlers photo for the gold pass but not the other 2 pass holders.We did the pools in front where you can interact and touch the animals. Â We then ventured to the kids section and waited in line for a ride. Â Kidlet tried to do the big huge climbing thing but shoes kept falling off.We tried to do the sea lion show but it was full so we went to the dolphin show. Â It seems like such a small pool for the amount of animals they have in there. Â You could see the animals in the holding pens before the show starts and they had 6+ animals in a seemingly small space. Â The show was 15 minutes of a warm up (dolphin island for the holidays) and then the show was about 15 minutes.We went to get food (and booze) and I was suprised that the gold pass gives you a 15% on booze even! Â The zoo does not do discounts on booze. Â We made our way to the line for the sea lion show. Â We liked this show much better (sea lions live a riff on Saturday night live). They did various tv shows with humans and animals interacting together.After that we were close to a roller coaster (manta? Â Mantra?) and went to get in line only to find out the wait was 1 hour. Â We went to look at otters and dolphins before our family decided they were tired and wanted to leave.Next time I go we will spend more time in the kiddie area and see more of the park. Â I do not think we will renew the passes as it just seems so sad (we have zoo passes also and my husband has the feels about zoos being sad).We will try to enjoy our passes for the year we have them and try to get our monies worth/see the things we want to see.
20,11/22/2019,5,I would give Seaworld a five star review because it is definitely my favorite amusement park of any I've ever been to. I love the shows and interactive displays. The arcade is the best of any I've ever been to. They have a jungle gym that goes over 30 feet high with all kinds of cargo and rope netting. The parents are encouraged to go up with the kids and it holds hundreds of people and is massive and spends over the entire kids play area which is probably an acre. You can touch all kinds of wild sea creatures and an enemies.
21,7/31/2019,5,Sea world was Awesome!!! I haven't been in a very very long time and just as I've expected! There has been so much wonderful quality educational messages in each of their shows! I truly loved it! Sea world has done so much to give so much love and care to all the beautiful animals!!!! I will be back again!!! I loved all the stations to touch all the sea animals!!! I loved it!!!
22,8/26/2019,4,"SeaWorld is one of those places where you can go and enjoy the outdoors activities. Fun for all ages and great live entertainment. The seasonal passes are very affordable and the perks that come with it are reasonable. Especially the dinning pass, to be able to eat every 90 minutes is extremely helpful. Walking around the theme park with young kids or teenagers can get a little overwhelming. Like most theme parks they are designed to always circle back to the front of the park. So it's almost impossible to get lost. Maybe turned around but not lost. From the Sea Lion to the Whale Shows there is always something going on. SeaWorld is an adventure plex, fun for all ages and an experience to remember. To EVERYONE, who is dedicated to operating and facilitating the daily functions of SeaWorld keep up the great job. It shows in the property and the on going efforts from your staff! ."
23,12/6/2019,3,"For those who have never been to a seaworld, it may be worth a visit. For those who have been to this seaworld or other seaworld in the US in the past, the quality of the seaworld in San Diego has definitely gone down. The Orca, dolphins, sea lions and the otter shows are just not the same anymore. They are not as entertaining and the tricks they performed Â are less impressive. Hopefully this is due to more animal rights protection and not due to lower budget or cost/profit Â reasons. Parking is is ridiculous at $25. Food is crazily expensive. Windows to see the penguins and other sea life creatures are filthy. The special Xmas shows are entertaining and nice. Great job. Don't miss it. Â Tips for others. Bring water bottles. Bring your own snack/food/Sandwich. The food is terrible and overpriced. They know you will have to pay and buy them so really isn't any incentive for the park to improve their food service/price."
24,8/6/2019,5,"We had a wonderful day learning all about sea life, watching a variety of shows and riding the thrilling roller coasters. Â There is truly something for everyone! Â We were greatly amazed with how much there was to do and how close and personable you get to be with the animals. Â We felt you can't beat it for the price!!! Â We also recommend the ALL you can eat wristbands. Â Good quality food, large portions and wide section!"
25,7/20/2019,4,"We came on a Saturday expecting it to be busy, but it was insane. Just getting in took about half an hour, no guidance or guidelines to follow as everyone drove negligently, speeding and cutting vehicles off. They need a better set up for sure! Usually when I'm in a large, overly crowded place, it sets my anxiety off, but I was surprisingly ok here. We really appreciate that they support our AD military AND our veterans. We scored 4 free passes, but still had to pay $85 for an extra pass. We caught almost every show, sat in the wet zone for the first time at the Orca show and had a huge splash! We got prime seating for the Sesame Street parade and visited 90% off all the animal exhibits. We haven't been here since our older two were very little, so we wanted this to be super special for our little girl and one year old's very first visit. You all didn't disappoint, we could have just sat and watched the two sloths all day and been happy. This is our 5 year old's favorite animal, right along with the flamingos. We got the kids' caricature done on the way out, almost $200! I couldn't pass it up as I always get one at every park we go to. Your summer Electric Nights theme was so much fun and our 5 year old had a blast with the glow dance party with the mermaids, but the Clyde & Seymour show will always be our favorite! Thank you, Sea World and see you next summer."
26,7/13/2019,4,"We bought tickets ahead of time. 20 minute line to walk in the front gate.When you first walk in there are some fun areas where you can ""pet"" the fish - by which I mean that fifty tiny fish will come up and nibble on your hands when you stick them in the water. It's a little ticklish! My 8 year-old adored it.Food quality in the park is not so great, but that's also not surprising. Bring your own, or spring for the usual tasty-but-unhealthy fare. Also, expect to wait for your food. Some vendors are as long as 15 min!The seal (and sea otter show) was fun and funny, but we ""only"" showed up 15 min in advance and were stuck in the nosebleeds. You really need to get there early for decent seats. Still, the kid loved it and the verdict was she was happy with the experience.The manta ray roller coaster gets special mention as a great coaster that anyone can ride. It IS intense though, so don't expect a cakewalk! My heart was pounding like crazy and the rug rat was laughing like an insane maniac.The inner tube ride is also really fun, and not at all intense. You do get wet, but you can get ponchos before you get on (recommended!!)Many, many awesome creatures to check out here! Not a cheap experience, but overall it's an great way to spend a day with the kid/kids!"
27,12/1/2019,5,"We had a phenomenal time as a family, especially since we were able to get the annual pass discount deal for Black Friday. The establishment appears to be making real efforts to improve the public education and awareness to help the animals now. I enjoyed the entire park, from the rides to the shows. The park was extremely clean and all of the staff interactions we had were pleasant. I am looking forward to using the passes throughout the year and definitely recommend this family experience."
28,8/27/2019,5,We had a great experience here. 1st time we went to the San Diego location I was pregnant and couldn't walk. We rented a wheelchair & we did so much! We really enjoyed our day there! The shows are amazing & the food was good. Like any amusement park in general of course the food was super expensive but we definitely had a really good time. We're military so we did get a nice discount which is great since of course the tickets to any amusement park are also very expensive. Everyone was super professional and very courteous. We're thinking about getting yearly passes
29,11/17/2019,5,I loved coming here when I was a kid and now I get to take my nieces here. We had fun letting pet the starfish and check out all the animals in SeaWorld. Everyone enjoyed the shows and little rides.Of course. The adult had some of their own fun. Like swimming with the dolphins and a little lunch date with Shamu. We always have a great time here. I would just say it's pretty expensive. Just like any other theme park.
30,2/28/2020,1,"I love Seaworld however, their Web site is the worst!Last time, they charged us and didn't send tickets.Today I tried to buy again and the same thing happened!They require you to enter the names of the people coming but when I click continue, nothing happens.They charged my bank account but sent no tickets.I have now been waiting over 20 minutes on the phone on hold!Another 5 minutes and I cancel."
31,1/7/2020,1,"Not worth at all. Â Dolphin show a few minutes of performance the rest just talk, little better with orcas. Half of the rides and food kiosks were closed. Not enough thing to do for the $ paid. Should be more like $25adult and $20 per child!Way overpriced! Â Parking $20-$40 seriously? WTF?Spent over a few hundred in toys to get an answer ""sorry no bags available"" what a joke! Been at Legoland a day prior spent same amount, Â tons of fun for our kids."
32,4/24/2019,3,"I'm just going to say this right out!! This was my very 1st visit to Sea World.. Ok, I know, at my age, Lol.I actually had a very good time here. Enjoyed the Dolphin show but loved the Orca's!! Those poor people up front in the soak zone-best thing I'd seen all day!The 2 downsides were standing in line to get food and how unorganized it is and there were many attractions closed due to construction but I have to say I really enjoyed it."
33,1/26/2020,4,"We Â got a season pass to come here since Â July 2019. It's been a great Â idea, we've used it quite a bit. 3 times to Aquatica, 4+ times to SeaWorld, including seeing the Lunar New Year festivities & trick or treating in autumn. Â We love Sesame Street Playland for the toddler. Lots to do and gives us a reason to visit San Diego more!"
34,8/11/2019,4,We had a great time here and I feel that SeaWorld is doing their best to provide the best entertainment possible with a great list of activities for kids and adults that will last you one whole day and possibly two if you want to experience everything without rushing from one activity to the next.I totally understand some of the negative comments from some yelpers but geez get over it. Some of them act as if they were forced to go and dig ditches all day. Your going to have some Cons like prices and parking and the crowds etc with the Pros. This is a great place to visit and it makes more sense to get a yearly membership with all the perks then pay for a day pass if you live in the area. Food is pricy but so is every other theme park like Disney and Universal etc. The shows were fantastic and cool how they get the audience involved. Nice selection of foods all over and cool animals and learning experiences. Staff were professional and knowledgeable.
35,1/30/2020,1,Horrible customer service.I purchased 4 annual passes and didnt read the fine print that it auto renews and will be charged monthly. I realized I was being billed for it and cancelled the day the passes expire.Seaworld still charged me for the following month and said i was my fault because I cancelled the account at night. And they refused to give me a refund!!!Be very careful signing up for their annual pass...
36,10/12/2019,4,"My mom won free SeaWorld tickets and I decided to bring my friend! I went and arrived pretty early. It was Labor Day, so it was pretty packed. The food there wasn't the best. You are able to bring in your own food, so I would suggest others to do the same. They allowed me to bring my hydroflask which was nice! I ordered the meal: three chicken tenders, mac and cheese, and bread. That meal was $17. I wanted to eat every bite considering how much I paid, but the mac and cheese tasted like cardboard. Without any exaggeration, it tasted like cardboard. I did not taste cheese or salt! My friend and I had an awesome time and we enjoyed the workers (all of them are around our age and were extremely personable). I just moved down to San Diego recently and mentioned this to a lot of the workers and many of them, being that they were locals, directed me to cool beaches and events to attend. The attractions/rides were pretty good! I felt very safe.The dolphin show was the best show they had!!!"
37,10/17/2019,2,"We entered hopefully having a wonderful day. Â There entry cost is low but the nickel and dime you in the park. Â 6$ extra each to take the sky ride. Â Extra charge for reservations and fast track options.They also seem to want to cause a line, a wait, a delay, a stop in the fun. Â The long single lane for the handiecap parking was our first clue.The restrooms were not kept clean and the park seemed under staffed for a Saturday in October. Â It fall break for us we wanted a great experience. Â The unlimited food deal is good, but u have to wait so long in line and not all food court's participate.The final assault on our time was at the Ship Wreck Cafe at 6:15 Â and got there just as they open the other side of the buffet presentation. Â We wizzed thur to probably the best food at the park. Â When the rest of the family arrived we were all eating when my niece arrived and we went to the buffet and they just closed the second side of buffet at 7:00 and forced a wait. They close at 7:30, so they did not save any hours, just made us wait to get through the long line.Its becoming a just ok spot in southern California's venue outdoor parks."
38,3/3/2020,3,"I haven't been to sea world for quite some time now and was so excited to finally come back on February 29. It was a nice, sunny but cool day and my family and I couldnt wait to see what exciting things we were about to do. We couldn't be more disappointed. We first tried to get on Manta, which we waited about 45 minutes in line.. only to see that the car got stuck and the employees told us it was going to close down. We were so close.. then it got stuck. What happened to maintenance check?? The park just opened around that time too.. ok, so then we tried to get on shipwreck rapids and waited about an hour as well... right before it was our turn... we saw that the ride got stuck as well.... and employees told us it was closing down... at this point i was fed up.. asking myself why us... and feeling lots of regret going that day. We complained to guest services and they gave us free fast passes good for a year.. which was fine, but we wont be coming back. We literally wasted the whole day waiting for nothing... all we did was wait.. wait at the food stalls, wait for the rides.. the only rides we got on were the kids rides. We didnt even get to see any shows... what a waste of time. Please do us a favor and make sure your maintenance crew does their job!"
39,3/30/2019,5,"We had the best time at SeaWorld the other day! If you can swing it, I recommend getting a two day pass. There is SO much to see and experience.They have several large touch pools with a variety of sea animals right as you go into the park. We spent awhile there and then were lured over to the dolphin feeding and training session. What a treat!We planned our show viewing out for the day so that we could easily see all three of the animal shows. The Sea Lion Live show was clearly the most entertaining (with a well thought out and hilarious story line). All three shows showcased how amazing these animals are and are most definitely must sees!You can check out my review of Flatbreads & Fry Cones as well as the one for Pineapple Pete's. Those are the two food establishments we visited.A couple of rides we planned to ride as well as the aquarium were closed the day we were there. That was a real bummer!The walking between everything didn't seem to be as far as you would expect, although we did do well over 14,700 steps that day.The Sky Tower is an additional $5 per person, but well worth the price. We went up so high; it was an amazing view.We definitely hope to be able to return someday and I highly recommend it if you are going to San Diego. It was the single best day in a marvelous, yet short, vacation."
40,8/27/2019,4,For those that have been to Sea World Â there are a few things that you should know when you go to large theme parks dirty bathrooms and long lines .  Â  Several times that I have been Sea World tour will find that the park has remodeled due to the mishaps at shammo stadium . You see food vendors that look like somthe from the ball park and circus combined Â . Â  Â There are a few good restaurants that are in the park the Busch gardens restaurant that serves a good Philly and good deserts . And some of the sandwich places make filling sandwiches and good salads . Â  Â  Â  The bakery near the front makes good deserts and baked goods and incredible ice cream Sundaes . The stores can be over priced Â some of them you will find merchandise on sale and new T_ Shirts for the year .
41,6/21/2019,4,"SeaWorld...What can I say about this theme park Icon. Â They've been around for ages and continue to trend in the right direction. Upon arrival we noticed that they have a huge parking lot but its best if you arrive early to avoid parking all the way in the back away from the entrance (tip: if you have kids do this!). Â Lines to the entrance could get long, just make sure your bags are easily accessible and tickets ready to be scanned. Â Inside the park, you'll notice a huge touch pool filled with ""Rays"" and Sharks. Â Feel free to touch them softly, as the trainer will advise you. Â My kid loved the interaction with them. Â Worth the memories. Â At this point everything is open to explore from shows to rides and not to mention a cool arcade area. Â The show's include: Â ""Dolphin Days"", ""Orca Encounter"", and ""Sea Lions Live"", just to name a few. Â I had a chance to watch all three with my son. Â We both really enjoyed watching the trainers work with the beautiful animals. Â They do some amazing tricks to keep everyone entertained, and the best thing is that you learn about these beautiful creatures. Â They also have rides for you or your kids to enjoy while your there. Â Check out the ""Shipwreck Rapids"" if you enjoy getting wet (wait lines could be up to an hour). Â Another one of my favorites was ""Electric Eel"" for your thrill seekers! Â But in all there are so many to check out, judge for yourself. Â I know whichever you choose you will have a blast.Once, you built up a hunger from all the amazing shows and rides, you'll have so many choices to choose from to grub! Â We had purchased an all day dining pass (You can enjoy a beverage, an entree, a side or a dessert up to once per hour at participating restaurants.) so we had a few spots to choose from. Â Try out the ""Calypso Bay Smokehouse"" if you like BBQ. Â We ordered the The Brisket and it was amazing, soft and succulent as well as flavorful. Â Remember when you have the all day dining pass you'll have other options to choose from but I'll let you decide what you like. Â All in all it was a great time, everyone had a chance to experience a wide variety of adventures here. Â I highly recommend putting SeaWorld on your bucket list. Â Have fun!"
42,9/14/2019,5,"We have memberships to the zoo/safari park, Children's Museum and SeaWorld and this is my daughter's favorite! We love being members because we can come just for 30 minutes to ""touch the fishies"" at the entrance or an hour to go on rides or run around the splash pad. The seasonal shows are fun, and we love the special member only promotions and events."
43,7/4/2019,5,"My family and I had an amazing time. There was something for everyone to enjoy. I highly recommend checking it out. The best of show would have to be the sea lion and otter show, the Orca whale show was majestic and a very special learning experience. As for my son, he loves the rides. ******* WARNING Â the water ride Shipwrecked was so much fun, but.... you get soaked (don't wear your good shoes, they will get wrecked). Wear flip flops and a poncho for sure. They sell both at the store near the entry*******"
44,1/12/2020,1,"Sort of sad . Penguins stink, A lot of closed spaces . No bright colors . No fun. Seriously... close down . Focus on the animals . Give them larger spaces . Save more animals and stop taking money for amusement."
45,2/29/2020,1,Gregory and Rafael were no help at customer service :( don't loose your kids here cus they close an hour before.... THANKS for the reply Morgan but I've tried calling that number and was on hold 2 different times for 2 hours so a total of 4 hours of my day to get disconnected by the time it hits the 2 hours..
46,12/24/2019,5,"This has been an annual trip for my family for almost 10 years now and we love it everytime. This one is not as big as the one in Orlando but they really pack it in! It's a popular park so dont expect it to be intimate and pristine, but it's pretty close to it. The park is clean, plenty of shops, the animals appear healthy, and the shows are always entertaining. My favorite part? The touch tanks. Especially the cleaner fish! Do yourself a favor, clean your hands and drop them in the cleaner fish tank!"
47,5/23/2019,4,"I'll be the first to admit that SeaWorld is not my favorite. Â The whales especially don't look happy, not that I'm an animal expert. Â They have sharks, fish, turtles, whales, otters, flamingos, and dolphins among other things. Â Some of the displays you can tell have been worked on a lot, but the ending result isn't as impressive. Â It is what it is. I have some cherished childhood memories here, the experience is really geared towards kids. Â The kids play area that is Sesame Street themed is really popular with the kiddos, my niece and nephew really enjoyed the rides and stuff over there. Â I do enjoy the sting ray pool where you can touch the sting rays, it's cool and not an experience that every amusement park can offer. Â It's not super great for kids because you do have to reach down a ways majority of the opportunities to touch. Â Parking is tolerable, but it could be slightly more organized. They could improve some things, but I can see the overall attraction to paying a visit."
48,7/30/2019,4,"We've always been a big fan of SeaWorld in San Diego. Â A good place to relax and spend time with the family. Â Plenty of parking spaces, for a fee, in the vicinity.A plus for our U.S. Armed Forces personnel eligible to receive free day passes for any active and veteran service members and three other dependents each year.A moment well-spent, especially, for those who very much enjoy watching aquatic animals, and better yet, be amazed to see animals that can perform in front of the crowd. Â Unfortunately, the theatrical Orca Show ended in 2017 due to an incident when a trainer was unintentionally drowned by a killer whale, Tilikum, in 2010. Â Although there was a brief hiatus in entertaining the spectators, SeaWorld found a way to enhance its entertainment lineup by adding more shows and exhilarating rides.SeaWorld is a place for all ages, and visitation, in my opinion, is best in the spring. Â The weather is perfect and the place is less congested. Â You will also witness baby animals at this time of the year. Â The flowers in the recreational area are also in full bloom at this time."
49,8/27/2019,1,"This review is of SeaWorlds billing practices. I bought 2 annual passes in April 2018. It had been six months or so since we had used the passes before they expired April 2019 (not that that matters). I noticed my credit card was still being charged for May, June, and July. I called and spoke with someone who said she would cancel the account and refund me at least one month. I called back today and someone else I spoke with said there is no record of a refund and she would not refund me (extremely rude woman). I asked to speak to a manager....30 minutes later still on hold. If you look at the legal terms on the ticket (see photo), it's misleading bc the terms say the pass will expire 1 year from date of redemption. If you are going to start to charging someone month to month....make it CLEAR and put it in the legal terms on the ticket.I finally was able to speak with a manager. She said my case is in financing. I will update the review once I have a final outcome."
50,9/9/2019,4,"The kids thought the best part of the SeaWorld were the shows - they were very impressed by the dolphins, orcas, and the sea lion show. Â They did have a greater appreciation for these animals and don't argue with me when I tell them to go recycle something. Â (We're saving the animals, mommy!) Â My favorite part? Â The cleaner fish at the opening to the park! Â Hilarious and so much fun for us. Â Just wish I could dip my feet in and get a pedicure..."
51,5/30/2019,5,"Let me start with this. I know the recent issues that have plagued Sea World. I'm a life long SoCal resident and have been to Sea World many times. I have never seen any abuse or anything that appeared to be neglect. Now that I have kids, it's even more important to visit places like Sea World. It is very educational and they teach lessons about being a responsible person, not littering, taking care of the environment. A lot of the animals have either been injured or lack the ability to survive in the wild so why not give them a good home??? I always learn something new when I visit and my kids really enjoy the shows. AND the sharks!There's so many animals we would never be exposed to if not for Sean World. Went on a field trip for my daughters Kindergarten class today. The new Orca show is awesome and focuses so much on teaching about Orcas and less about what kind of cool tricks they can do. There are still some fun moments but the ""tricks"" are all explained as natural behaviors and the reasons behind them are very interesting."
52,10/21/2019,2,"I only have one thing to say. Â Literally, there is only one park staff member per ride, and there has to be at least two. Â Because there's only one park staff per ride, the lines moved excruciatingly slow, and each ride took about 10 minutes just to get the people on and off the rides. Â This is not including the two or three minutes of the ride's operating time. Â At the tentacle twister, one park staff checked 30 or so swings all by herself when guests were getting on the swings. Â And, I really lost my patience when the single park staff has to walk back and forth checking kids' height and counting how many riders can get on the two seat swings. Â The travel time between the three check points could easily be eliminated with another staff member. Â When getting in line, the sign at the entrance reads kids under 48"" has to have a companion. Â Lots of kids lost their place in line when they'd get to the ride and was then told by the park staff that the ""companion"" has to be an adult and not ""a 14 year old or a 16 year old""."
53,8/30/2019,4,"We snagged 30% off tickets because they were having a summer special online, so we thought it was totally worth it. Definitely check the schedule and watch all the live performances (which we thought was the best part)!"
54,8/23/2019,5,"Seaworld always has been one of our favorite places and continues to be. The park has some many different things to do. We love that our funds go to a great cause. The staff is so professional, food fresh and delicious, and park impeccably clean. I love their mission of sustainability and conservation reflects in their operations too. I am sorry to see some lower rated reviews as our experience has always been wonderful over the past 20 years. Yes, they do continue to adapt to the market to continue to attract customers of all ages to be able to continue to do the work they do. Love this place and the value they bring to the region."
55,8/15/2019,5,"Seaworld is always a great place to visit whenever we come from Los Angeles to San Diego. My daughter and wife absolutely love it here. The last time I had came was with my autistic brother. I really have to thank seaworld for being so understanding in regards to autistic children and adults. They're very accommodating and very respectful. Not a lot of places are educated on autistic kids, But at Sea World they definitely know how to handle and engage with them and they try to do everything possible to make it easy on someone bringing a special child. Â The shows are definitely great. The Orca show and the dolphin show but my kid also loved the Sesame Street parade. My Â Personal favorite was the new Electric Ocean show. Â It had dancing cool lights and music And a guy doing back flips on a jetski! Thank you for making our memory at Sea World's on my mobile will definitely return again"
56,10/15/2018,2,"I did somewhat enjoy my visit to seaworld. This is my first living memory of attending this park, despite my mom telling me that I've been here already when I was a toddler hah. Wanted to rate this place 4 stars, but after pondering over the strange observations that I've noticed and watching BlackFish immediately afterwards *completely* changed my experience and perspective towards this sick industry. While I am grateful to have seen such majestic animals up so close and am now extra conscious about how my actions indirectly pollutes their homes, I just think we should leave these poor animals alone. Throughout my visit, I had felt a propagandist feel saying how Sea World is the world's leader in animal and care rescue. There were SO many videos of them showing that one turtle that was released into the ocean or that one whale that left. To be honest, who knows how many rescues were unsuccessful. Now, I'm just interested in seeing Â percentages, not absolute counts and see how they fare in relative to other rescue orgs. (It makes a big difference if you saved 1,000 animals but really hypothetically 5,000 captured and 4,000 died so..20% survived.) Regardless, the consumer must be smart about the information presented (especially in the political climate we're in right now..) The only good animal exhibition for me was seeing the penguins outside. It was smelly but it was so cute seeing them wag their tails. But, it was such a crammed space for so many penguins, leaving them very little room to really walk around...very conflicted about this. I did notice the water was filthy dirty, so that's definitely not good. Now onto the orca show- Ah, collapsed dorsal fins....IT IS STILL HAPPENING. The fins I saw at the park was in complete contrast to the (boring) orca encounter video. It was an odd performance and I didn't know what to make of. The whales seemed like puppets and just jumped when told to. Some just didn't perform the tricks at all and so I was just watching the trainers most of the time. To paraphrase from the blackfish documentary (though it is controversial in terms of how factual it is, I still think the following premise is reasonable) - this is not how you treat kin of other species that live in this planet. Respect them. This whole experience really opened my eyes to animal captivity then I never had before.With this negative review, I might as well go all out but other things from an amusement park attendee's perspective: Fryzone - ridiculous service. Waited more than 20 minutes with just five people in front of me a little before 2pm. There were 4-5 staff inside the restaurant just talking/giggling and they were moving at a slow pace without any sense of awareness that there was a line of customers outside (in the heat) waiting for food. Honey, if you're cooking food that's made to order, at least come out and notify clients out of courtesy that they need to wait. Oh, and the food was already pre made. They just had to ... prep the food! Seriously frustrating! Journey to Atlantis - interior of rides was rusty and I noticed some mold at the bottom. Please change or clean up the logs. Only one pro of Sea World: Electric eel was dope. But, don't pay your money to come here for just this ride ... Â go to the other theme parks up north in LA/OC."
57,4/20/2019,5,"Well, SeaWorld... either I've changed or you have. Or both. I lived in San Diego for a year and the Zoo and Safari Park are just so much better as far as animal exhibits and friendly employees go! I'd go back to those again but not here again. It was fun to take my dad though... he even went on the rollercoaster at 72 years old.Pros?The shows, especially the dolphin show, are still really funOverall there's a lot to do in a day hereLove the bat rays exhibit and petting themCons?It was so hard to get a beer here... the guys checked our ID's multiple times and kept asking if we'd bought one or two in the last hour and talking about regulations... first off, my dad is 72... secondly, we had one beer 5+ hours before we came backThe dolphin show didn't have as much of the acrobatics and people doing diving as it did when I went beforeOverall even on a weekday it was a very expensive and busy place to go"
58,7/20/2019,5,"I went to sea world for the first time, I went with my fiance and his family, we spent the whole day and had a really great time, I can't wait to go back"
59,4/11/2019,5,"One of my favorite family places in San Diego! I recommend to arrive a little earlier before they open at 10am (9:30-9:45am is best). Parking increases every year and this year (2019) general parking is $22 and free for pass holders. It is also possible to get a Lyft or Uber to drop you off at the entrance.I recommend to look up on their website the times for the shows and plan according to them. If you plan to go more than once, do it like us: buy a pass :) and you don't have to worry about parking either. Be aware that you might get wet if you sit in the splash zone and bring an extra set of clothes if you plan to sit close :) it can get hot in the summer and I don't mind to get salt water on me, but you might want your children to be dry in the car. It is a great family place and for smaller kids they offer Sesame Street. I'd recommend to go there if you have smaller children. It's very easy to spend a whole day at Sea World. After the shows I love to see the penguins, sharks and turtles! There isn't a place I wouldn't go.I'm not a big fan of their food but with a small kid I am able to pack a snack bag and eat a littler healthier. Otherwise they offer the standard fast food you find in every amusement park."
60,2/18/2019,4,"I would give SeaWorld 3 1/2 stars. This place had all the sea animals from penguins, flamingos, seals, walruses, dolphins, sting rays, and had a whale. The weather today was windy, at times there was rain, and it had sun in the morning. The weather was ever-changing. Suggestion: wear layers. You have many options to choose to feed the sea animals and sometimes even touching them. It is definitely kid friendly. When we came in, the maps were gone, so we wandered a bit until we decided to take a picture of the map. So, if there are no paper maps, take a picture, so you can use your phone. I loved the signage and information about the sea animals and how we can protect their environment. The shows were also educational and entertaining as well. I learned more about penguins and seals. I'm sure families enjoyed their time too! Thanks!"

63,1/16/2020,5,Great place for animal education and rides a perfect Â balance and great food MantA is definitely the best ride in the park marathon it enthusiasts as many times as you can
64,8/27/2018,4,"Sea world has come a long way since back in the day when I was a child. They're Â are continuously adding and growing as well. We got a season pass here for the year and we've Â already taken full use of it. Its a great deal. It comes out to about 9 dollars a month and considering that our twins are still under 3 and free it was the right way to go. Â  We also bought the souvenir cup which is definitely worth it. Everytime we come its only 1.07 for a large drink. Theres not a ton of rides for little kids but enough to keep them entertained. Â Its a cute little Sesame Street area. Theres a parade that happens on the weekends but I wish they would do it at least one day during the week too.  I haven't had a chance to ride the new roller coaster but it looks pretty fun. Journey to Atlantis has always been one of my favorite water/coasters. The food is descent and pretty standard amusement park prices. Â We got a cup of fruit and churro for 8 dollars for example. Â The Whale show is not as magical as i remember it being. My girls lost their interest very fast, Â but the dolphin and sea lion/otter show make up for that. Customer service is pretty good around the park too. I enjoy Sea World with my kids because its not super crowded and you only need a few hours there. Especially if you're a season pass holder."
65,12/24/2019,1,"All I will comment on is the food. I have been here three times and every time it's been the same. A great time is had by my family and I but when it comes time to eat a meal, it's horrible. We have tried 3 ""restaurants"" and it seems each is worse than the last."
66,8/19/2018,4,"Just a good day enjoying each others company and animals. A friend of mine use to do the Seymour & Clyde show and the dolphin show. It was nice to see the changes on the sets and the new shows and new trainers. Evening shows were bright and lively. The sea lions didn't stink like the La Jolla sea lions. The dolphins made me miss living on a little island and paddling with my team behind Sea World with wild dolphins in the bay. The Morey Eels still looked scary nuts. The Garra Rufa are fun. The Penguins still looked like they are dressed to the 9's in Tuxedos enjoying a cocktail party. Â The stingrays or bat rays were beautiful gliding by giving a high 5 or high fin. Animals Rule was super cute. Â It's Sea World. Bravo on all the rescues they do all year. Â We had fun on the rides, shows, petting animals and just hanging out. Mel MYelp 18:129"
67,10/5/2019,4,"Had a good time at Sea World being in the military you get in free with guess if you have them, I believe it's up to four or five I say make a friend in the military. The killer whale was entertaining and informative being in the splash zone is always a good time, the Halloween theme is in full swing with ghost and others spooky creatures for the young kids to enjoy, there is so many food options from pizza, ribs and burgers and beers for the adults. The dolphins was a joy as well and you can pay a little extra to swim with the dolphins as well and that experience is once and a lifetime and you have other smaller fish and sea creatures you can see but you won't be there for long . The roller coaster is cool not really my thing and I'm glad it's not because the water ride broke down during my visit and they had to close it down to check it out and a few things was closed due to being broken the sky tower is been down for a minute now along with other key rides."
68,6/2/2019,3,"This place is definitely meant for kids. Some of the rides and activities are an additional Â cost to your ticket to enter. The shows were cool, the dolphin show was my favorite. The park is just small and there's not much to do other than feed a few animals and wait between shows."
69,12/28/2019,3,Fun place overall but the Cirque Christmas event is terribly organized and unless you purchase reserved seats which cost extra your wait to get into this event can be 90 minutes plus and the ushers who are responsible for getting you into an event are not very knowledgeable and very unorganized. I would recommend paying additional money for reserved seats otherwise a majority of time at the park will be spent waiting in line and clumped together close enough to smell the breath and body odor of the others around you. Once you get into this event is is only mediocre. The Winter Wonderland On Ice event is much better.
70,1/9/2020,5,This place is a 16th the cost of Disneyland and the kids love it. It's not the best looking or newest amusement Â park but the employees are always nice and lines are fairly short. I would definitely recommend this place.
71,2/19/2020,1,"SeaWorld used to be so much fun, however it's way over priced for a zoo with some nice shows. Merchandise is beyond expensive. $40 for a pair of slides, not my cup of tea. Since the closing of Shamu shows, the park must meet other demands and therefore must make up the cost elsewhere. The park isn't clean anymore either. You're paying more for less. Shame."
72,5/16/2019,4,"I went there in March this year. We reached there by 10am to beat the crowds and could see everything by 3pm. I really liked the shows, especially Dolphin Show. I have also seen Dolphin Show in Shedd Aquarium Chicago and it's nowhere compared to this one. My husband and I also loved Manta roller coaster ride. We adjusted our schedule based on shows' timings and did rides in between the shows. The shipwreck rapids ride was okay so can be skipped if you don't have much time. It's a good place to spend a day when you are in the area."
73,8/4/2019,1,"If you are expecting experiences you might get from Disneyland or Universal Studio in LA like me, then you should NEVER NEVER NEVER go this place.Firstly, I purchased premium ticket or fast pass + meal pass ticket or whatever they call it, that means you have reserved seats for shows, but staff weren't aware of that and people were sitting everywhere, the premium ticket means nothing.Secondly, their restaurant has all the junk food option but nothing else. Thirdly, no one clean the trash in trash can or on the street.They just don't care about customers, so we ended up leaving the park at 2pm. We only stayed there for less than 3 hours and could no longer tolerate any more.However, if you simply want to donate some money the support wild life, then just donate, don't go to this park, because this park has no clue how to give good experience to customers."
74,12/17/2019,1,"They no longer have the cubbies by the rides to put your bags, and you can't take them on with you essentially forcing you to rent a locker at $3.00 an hour. Taking another complimentary service and finding a way to charge money for it."
75,1/4/2020,5,"Love it, have been coming here with the family many many times. People who complain about prices, lines, wait times, parking, reserved seating, staff being less knowledgeable, mediocre shows should go home or build their own sea world. Sea world is not Disneyland"
76,4/25/2019,3,"Went during the week so it would be less crowded, which it was. As always the dolphin show, sea lion show & orca show was very fun to watch for all ages. Â Great place to take little ones with Sesame Street rides.However my 3 Stars rating is for the following:Rides (for older kids/adults) are not running when the park opens, some aren't running until 12pYou can't take your bag/belongings with you to the ride and place them in a cubby/floor right before boarding the coasters, they make you rent a locker so you can get on the ride!! So you have to wait in line to be able to use the kiosk, rent your locker & then get in line for the ride.****time consuming***So it's hard to plan to make time to ride then as you're trying to make time to go to their animal showsThe orca show was showing only 1 time for the day, so the whole park is trying to squeeze in to watch the only showing1 place that was selling funnel cake & pineapple ice cream throughout the whole park was also selling food, so waiting in line took a long time. $22 for parking"
77,9/2/2019,2,"The shows and rides are fun and great! But, when I asked a lady at the front counter how I wanted to claim a free ticket under my platinum pass she questioned why I wanted to claim the ticket. I told her it was for my friend and she insisted that my friend buys a membership. We told her it's okay and that I wanted to claim the ticket for my friend so they could sit with us at platinum seating. She then raised her voice and told me platinum members don't get reserve seating. I explained to her how I've been a platinum member for 5+ years and how I've always had reserved seating. She then told me that I was wrong and proceeded to walk away to a lady at in a black jacket. While she was talking to the lady, I noticed a flyer on the desk stating that platinum members receive reserve seating. When she came back she whispered something to a coworker next to her and they both laughed. I then showed her the flyer and she didn't even look at me and said, ""yeah, I know"" It's been one of the worse customer service experiences I've ever had and I will be ending my membership shortly."
78,7/15/2019,1,"This place has gone to sh!t. For good reason, mind you but damn. Haven't been there in 15 years, got free tickets, so we decided to go. Gone are the quiet days of learning about our ocean life. This place is a loud, obnoxious wasteland of overpriced food, sad enclosures and overpriced EVERYTHING. It's gross, things are broken and there are loud roller coasters in extreme close proximity to the animals. Did I mention its LOUD ? Music being piped throigh speakers everywhere and the roller coasters. I'd HATE to be an animal here. They should just completely turn it into an amusemwnt park and find homes for all those poor animals."
79,1/4/2020,2,"I came last year it was fun and the shows were wonderful l, today I went for the second time and the park was dirty, all the snacks stations were closed, worst dolphin show ever, the orca show was all about getting the visitors wet Â which was not fun in winter. I will never come back again."
80,4/11/2019,5,"Seaworld, though pricey (which is typical now for expansive parks), is a must see attraction. Â I have been there a few times and my last visit was with my grand children. Â This has so many attractions and the variety makes it a fulfilling fun visit with your family. When my daughter's family visit from Washington State, this a must see re-turn visit. Â When my grandson who is 6 years old visited, he told us it was the best day of his life! Even my 2 year old grand daughter was very entertained. There are also numerous eating outlets through out the park, but as all such parks, is a little pricey. Recommend you check on line for specials for entrance. Â At the time they had a special that was outstanding compared to the normal prices. It will take a few minutes in the morning to come through the gates and parking, but it was not too bad. This place also has several rides and also several hands-on exhibits. Â My grandsons especially enjoyed feeding the rays. Â Enjoy. Your family will have fun! Remember to check on line before you come."
81,9/29/2019,5,"I was here a few years back. Me and a few friends went one afternoon and my ticket was free so I went. I was actually impressed with the place to be honest. It was clean and not crowded. The one show we went to was enjoyable.I'm not sure if I will ever have the opportunity to go back but if you have kids or just want to check it out because you have never been there, I highly recommend it."
82,7/17/2019,2,"The last time my family went to Sea World was over 6 years ago which doesn't seem that long ago but this park has changed a lot since then. Here are my thoughts and tips:1. Parking prices have gone up a lot. It is now $22 to park your car which I think is high. It may be cheaper to Uber into the park. They actually have an Uber drop off point so they must realize that their parking prices are high. 2. Because Sea World has changed their shows to become more educational, they are not as entertaining. However, I completely understand and applaud their efforts to educate their visitors on the different mammals and sea life that can be found at the park. However, they needed to develop other activities that are entertaining so they have added more rides for all ages. Adding all these rides have changed the feel of the park.3. Due to lines we only did two rides: Journey to Atlantis and Manta. They updated the exterior look of Journey to Atlantis and it looks more updated and cleaner. This ride is our favorite in the park. You get wet but not too much. If you sit in the last row you tend to get more wet. They updated the story for the ride. However, it's not engaging and difficult to hear over the other sounds. As for Manta - please note that you can't take any items onto this ride so you must pay for a locker to store your items or leave them with someone who is not riding. The lockers are $2/hour and we paid for one locker which is big enough for one big backpack or two smaller bags. I'm guessing because of this policy, the lines for this ride was short so we went on it 2 times in a row to justify getting the locker. 4. The number of shows per day has gone down. This is probably due to better care of the animals. My son and I got to the park at 11:30am and only went to one show (Sea Lion show - still funny) because we already missed the earlier ones and we left at 3pm so we didn't see the later ones. There are the night times shows which you can stay for. 5. Overall, the park has sadly gone downhill which explains why the crowd seemed light for summer time. Some attractions have closed down. We used to love the ""Pets Rule"" show but that's gone. Other attractions need to be repaired or updated. I think that if you are visiting San Diego for the first time and haven't seen this type of park before, it might be worth a visit. Find discount tickets. They are out there. I doubt I will be returning any time soon or ever. Â It's a different Sea World than the one my kids grew up with."
83,3/22/2019,1,"Ick! Â Not only is this park the theme park equivalent to Sears in that it is slowly dying! Â Sea World seems unaware of its failing with shows like the Seymour Seal & Otter performance just highlights how desperate the park has become. The trainers literally look like they rolled out of bed. Hair all askew, costumes that looked ratty- it was sad. Upon entering the park at the start of their day, 10 am, NOTHING was open. Not one eatery, Aquarium nor gift shop. One was expected to entertain themselves with solely with their two VERY CROWDED touch tanks which are directly positioned at the entrance. Also- their food is questionable. Attached are pictures taken at 12:30 pm of their ice cream coolers. They show EXTREMELY unsanitary coolers which are obviously not up to health code. Save your money- go to Scripts instead."
84,7/11/2019,3,"It's been about 20 years since I've been to SeaWold in San Diego. Â I was hoping for an improvement, but was disappointed.Tickets are a bit pricy for the level of entertainment quality. Â I understand we're supporting the animals, but overall, I had hoped for a little more.First, charging $22.00 for parking is theft, IMO. Â They're obviously adding the cost of parking to the overall cost of attending the park. Â No way should they charge $22.00. Â $8.00 max. Â Charging that much for parking is a rip-off, plain and simple!The best show is the Orca Encounter, but that's not saying much. Â Most of the shows were ho-hum. Â The simulation ride at the Arctic Encounter was a major let-down. Â It lasted like what felt like 2 minutes and was overrated. Â Even the employee that seated everyone seemed miffed at the crowd when a customer buckled their seat-belt on an empty seat. Â He had to reset the sensor on the computer in order to reset everything. Â Sort of embarrassing and awkward.Overall, the park doesn't feel ""family-friendly."" Â $22.00 to park, $11.99 for a pizza, $8.00 for drink, and $10.00 for alcoholic beverages, $5.00 for a small ice cream sandwich. It's obviously a money-grab.Considering this is California, where everything is over-priced due to their liberal politics, I guess I shouldn't expect anything different.Will I go again? Â I seriously doubt it. Â It's just not worth it."
85,3/7/2019,3,Man SeaWorld really use to be worth the money but now it really let us down. Way too expensive for what we experienced. It seemed as though there was more cafes/restaurants and souvenir shops than actual attractions open. Huge Con: The Sky Ride was closed but even if it were open it would have cost 5.00 to ride! What the heck is that about??? I have to pay 150.00 for the family to get in and then I have to pay for extra attractions??? FRIGGIN RIP! Not as good as it use to be gents.
86,7/30/2019,1,"This is sad coming from a place that's billed as family friendly. Â We have yearly passes, and my 10 month son was involved in a pretty serious accident. Â We asked to pause our membership, since he can't be exposed to sun for at least a couple months, and that request was simply denied because it didn't fit in their policy. Â I understand the terms of the agreement, but you'd figure that a place that's ""family friendly"" would be just that. Â I guess not.Not a sympathetic ear, not a ""sorry,"" just mainly given a ""f you, you have a contract and you're stuck with it sucker."""
87,1/9/2019,5,"SeaWorld definitely brings out the kid in me! I'm glad I can now bring my daughters here and they can enjoy everything the park has to offer. We are annual passes so being able to go during the week when there aren't many people is a definite plus. We get to actually try various rides and attractions out as well as shows we normally wouldn't catch on a weekend. I also value the different freebies annual pass holders get as well as holiday season parades, shows, etc. I will keep renewing my annual pass and enjoying Sea World as a true SD resident!"
88,7/21/2019,1,"I was completely disappointed overall with Seaworld. Starting with the complete lack of direction in the parking lot, to the lack absolute lack of cleanliness - garbage cans overflowing, trash on the ground, and disgusting restrooms. I was actually shocked."
89,5/26/2019,5,"I absolutely loved SeaWorld! I traveled from LA, California to re visit one of my childhood attractions. SeaWorld has changed so much! Their attractions are wonderful and are way better than visiting any zoo. They have amazing thrill roll-coasters for adults and play areas for children. Their show attractions were beautiful and full lights. Their food restaurants are great, I would recommend getting their all dine deal. It's a pity that I don't live in SD to come every weekend. Thank you SeaWorld, see you soon!"
90,7/2/2019,2,"Definitely a fun amusement park to go to every once in a while, but I don't think the price for each ticket is worth it. The park itself isn't big & rides are limited. You only really need half a day to explore this park. Everything is overpriced as well."
91,7/19/2019,4,"I would like to update my review because I am season pass holder and came here a few days ago. Well first let me say this park must be ran by kids. When I came here the first time it was bad but came back a second time it was worse. First off entering the park they had no park maps out or left. Everybody told us we had to wait so some employee can bring them out because they ran out. How can they run out of park maps in the morning? Just ridiculous. Everyone had to wait for a map. Next there was trash all around the park sitting in bins and all over the grounds by Â the soda stations, of boxes, cups, and people's trash. Where are the employees to clean this up? They have A horrible food and beverage manager there because all the places we stopped by to eat at...sucked. The food was terrible and all the employees are rude. All the soda stations were out of drinks and nothing left, nobody was filling them up the whole day. They have little kids running this place!!! We came here with my fiancÃ©'s parents that haven't been back since the 80s, on bring a friend day and we had the most horrible time. I am very disappointed on how seaworld is ran now. Everything is a mess here.Also the restrooms are a mess. Toilets not flushed, tissue laying on the floors next to the toilets and they all stink. I didn't see one employee in there cleaning anything up. All the restrooms smell. At least knotts berry farm cleans the restrooms and so does Disneyland. We went to some food stand that had stir fry noodles. We all got sick off the noodles and my fiancÃ©'s parents had to leave early. We all got sick and had to use the restroom right after. I'm sure the food is old around the park and they are not keeping the temperature right with it food. Becareful you mite get food poisoning. Always check your food. However my fiancÃ© is a chef and is very upset how the food and beverage manger is running this place. Last time we came here, we had bloody chicken from the smoke restaurant. They didn't care when we complained about it and just told us to get another piece. Besides all this all the shows sucked at night and were not worth staying to watch 10min shows. I feel like they use to be at least a half hour long, not anymore. They felt like 10mins. Not worth it. The sea lion show was good, but mostly had a kid dancing for the audience and barely saw any sea lions doing anything. The shows sucked!!!!Overall this place needs to upgrade, employees need more training, food area needs help, trash needs to be picked up around the park, restrooms need to be cleaned better, they need better and longer shows, they need employees in the aquariums to explain to people what we are looking at and control the kids banging on the glass and being rude to people that are looking at the animals. The picture people are also rude and they charge $20 for a pic they take of you in the park unless you buy $100 picture pass they want to rip you off anyway they can. They charge $2 for a locker when they use to be $1. Now they want you to put everything in a locker on every ride which is ridiculous!!! They have no cubbyholes for items like knotts has. This place is a joke. Sorry but we will not be renewing our passes and sadly...I don't want to come back with what we have left of the season year on them. If I could I would get my money back for our passes!!!!So not worth it. Â I hope they fix and change this park soon!!! And listen to the reviews on here and fix things. I am so sad how this park is ran. I love animals but this just makes me think how they are being treated if the park is ran bad!!! Go at your risk and watch what you eat here."
92,9/30/2018,4,"I have mixed emotions as writing this review.Let's get started with entry. $90 to get through the gate seems steep even if the money is going to conservation and rescue efforts. With all the add ons and food it just seems steep. Having said that, they are very gracious in honoring veterans and allow free admission for the vet and up to 3 guests. I don't know of any other California company offering that. So I thank Sea World kindly for the family day we shared.There is a all day food pass. $35 allows you to eat every 60 minutes. Sounds like gluttony, but they have a lot of options Italian food, smokehouse, and Hawaiian to name a few. Food is not five star but I'd go a four star. Good food. 1 entrie, 1 side or dessert and a drink. Portions are large enough to fill you up.The park is very clean and kept up. I watched a worker leaving for the day and bent over maybe a foot from a man's foot and picked up some trash on her way by. Great example for everyone around.The rides are fit for everyone. Most lines move fast but the Raging Rapids a bit slower. Definitely worth the wait. You will not walk away dissatisfied or dry.The wildlife exhibits are well maintained and the wildlife seem happy. I think these places are wonderful for kids to get involved and learn about the deep blue. It helps better an understanding of the Earth and her inhabitants. Wonderful day with family and San Diego salty breezes. Educational day that doesn't feel overwhelming. Lots of people but great crowd."
93,8/14/2019,2,"This was our first trip back to SeaWorld in years. Took my teenager and her friends. Â Here is a review from all of us. SeaWorld Pros: Â  Shamu show Dolphin showFeeding sea lionsSeeing the beluga whales. Crazy roller coasterSeaworld Cons:Nasty dirty like trash everywhere, nothing seemed to be wiped down, I felt like I was going to get a disease. Habitats run down and old made me feel bad for the animals. I remember there being much more to see and do it's run down dirty.It's more like a carnival with games and loud music and employees trying to sell stuff like at a baseball game shirts, towels, popcorn, peanuts. The food wrist band was a waste of money only certain items that looked gross and like it had been sitting forever. We liked the employees at the Stingray gift shop where we bought our name bracelets and the girl we bought our tickets from at the front all others were rude and could care less but that seems to be the overall theme of the park."
94,2/7/2020,3,"What i missed most i realized this past wed was missing the animal shows where the trainers perform with them. You know, where shamoo used to throw them in the air, or tricks with dolphins!! Now the shows are getting boring!! The demise of seaworld is having peta as stockholders. If peta was removed, i think seaworld would be great again like it used to be back in the past."
95,11/2/2019,2,"On Saturday October 12 2019, I went to Sea World San Diego with one of my clients and two of my friends who are in wheelchairs and cannot walk As well as another aid to help assist the two girls with transporting. The girls wanted to go on ShipWreck Rapids and were told by a worker ""because they don't have a disability pass they cant enter through the ADA area they must wait in the regular line"" the regular line is not ADA accessible when the girls brought that up they were ""because you can't walk you cannot ride the ride"". I was getting something to drink really fast so Â they called me in tears feeling discriminated against for their disability. I appeared and spoke to the same worker named Boynik and it was extremely clear she did NOT want them on the ride. Had a disability pass for my client so that was not the point so I explained the ADA law to her because they are in wheelchairs its quite clear they cant wait in a line with stairs which is why this ADA area is here. You denying the right and access to this ride is also against Lanterman act which gives those with disabilities the equal right as you and I have. Her response Â was on the back they is says must be able to transport they cannot transport themselves. I Asked why do you think we are here? And requested her manager. She got a gentleman named Wagner I gave him the same information. In which his response ""as long as everyone can get on and off the ride safely thats all that matters to me if the ride breaks down can you can they get up the stairs?"" I said ""we would have to carry them which of course isn't an ideal situation but in a case of an emergency we can do it no problem"" He agreed and Â  Let us on the ride. As I was getting on the ride I saw Boynik make a call to the ride operator i read her lips clear as day say ""stop the ride"" they started to move the wheelchairs as we went off. So Â we went through the ride and what do you know as soon as we passed the ride operator the entire ride stopped. There we sat for 25mins Boynik ran over with a smile on her face tapping our raft ""dont we'll get you guys right out"" as she ran away laughing. They emptied every raft but ours then Boynik pushed us back towards the operator farther from the emergency exit stairs to the point the operator yelled at her and said stop pushing and she didnt listen so our raft told her and she yelled at the operator questioning our group. We go to get off i Have one girl in my arms and the other aid had the other girl in his arms both girls over 100pounds dead weight no direction was given I ask where do we go? Â I realized all the worker are standing around laughing at our and one worker points over to a foot long of space and says ""its quicker to go that way."" Between the wall and the track of the attraction with a human body in my hand Â I asked ""do you have a safer option"" he pointed ""you could go all the way around"" Of course I took the safer option. We walked all the way to the stair then up two flights of stairs while i could still hear them laughing then I look over and see the line for the ride and everyone is staring so now these girls have been discriminated against, judged, laughed and humiliated!! Wagner didnt say a word but followed us up the stairs and then apologized I replied ""your point has been made what do you think im thinking right now the ride stopped after you asked us if the ride breaks down"" do you think thats just a coincidence?"" The REAL ride manager Â appeared and introduced himself Wagner put his head down and ran back down the stairs while I spoke to the ride manager who sincerely apologetic Wagner is an assistant manager who played the role of the real ride manager and that when someone who needs assistance transporting on and off of a ride medical come and assist which they were not even called!!! I have called and left complaints and nothing this isn't something thats just going to go away. I will take further action!"
96,12/24/2019,4,"I would rate SeaWorld 5 stars if only I didn't have to pay for so many extra things. Apart from parking, lots of the rides required storing personal things in lockers that were $2 per hour, the drier after the wet water rides was $6, and we also paid $6 each for getting on an extra ride that was only 6 minutes long. Other than that, we had lots of fun, what a great idea of combining an aquarium with an amusement park with lots of awesome rides! My favorite was the Electric Eel ride that we rode 5 times!"
97,4/25/2019,5,"Sea World, this place is amazing! My family and I agreed that it is much more better than Disneyland. The tickets and parking was expensive but the fun was definitely worth it. All the rides are free and so is the shows. Get to the show early because towards the start of the show time it gets so packed! Like very packed and crowded. Do not get the Starbucks there, it doesn't taste like Starbucks lol. They have a option where you can buy online or at the restaurants where you pay about $40 per person for an free all day dining. We stopped for some BBQ at Calypso Bay BBQ in Sea World and it was so good! Definitely would recommend that. The line was so long though, waited for an hour. Sea World has been one of the place I've visited and we will be there again."
98,3/31/2019,4,"SeaWorld was always on my list of places to visit and we finally made it. It was an amazing experience watching all the amazing sea creatures perform such stupendous acts!We went here during the Christmas time last year and everything was themed around the Christmas spirit which was really nice and enjoyable. We watched different shows where sea creatures like Orca (Killer Whales), Dolphins and Sea Lions were the main characters in the show. The Orca and Dolphin shows were really good with them performing such perfect acts on cue by the staff. The bonding between the staff and these beautiful animals was truly amazing and they had such strong trust amongst themselves. SLL (Sea Lions Live) show with Clyde and Seamore was the best! It was super entertaining with the funny host doing all crazy things. They also had a little small-clawed otter, named OP who was a cute little fella doing amazing things on the stage. One thing to note is that all these shows fill up really quickly so being quick really helps so that you can get the best seat. The first few rows are marked as wet zone and for fun, the staff makes the animals splash so if you are in those seats, you surely will drench!There were also several other Christmas themed shows and performances to watch. Rudolf's movie was nice and they had imitation snowfall whenever there was a scene with snowfall which made the experience so real and fun. We also clicked pictures with Rudolf later.There are many rides too out of which the Electric Eel was the scariest. It is a super fast roller coaster. Go to this one only if you can handle the speed and going upside-down because it is freaking fast. I really love rides but this was certainly a bit too much to handle for me as well. Manta is also a roller coaster but wasn't as fast as the Electric Eel. This was good too. At these rides, they do have lockers where you can store your personal belongings while you are enjoying the ride. Bayside Skyride is a gondola ride that would give you a nice and calm experience of the view from the top with a nice oceanic breeze. Every ride is inclusive of your ticket price except this one where the entrance fee is $5 per person.Food at SeaWorld is okay as most of the amusement parks. There are a few options where you can get a bite to eat. Would definitely recommend SeaWorld for everyone who loves animals!!"
99,2/1/2020,1,This place SUCKS. All a waiting game and no real guidanceto how this place is operated.. dont waste your money on this poor customer service place. Â The only adventure you'll get here is excuses and a big Â headache..
100,10/12/2019,5,Great community Â a d world asset.So many animals have been rescued by them.they support the community. What else would you want from a great neighbor .thank you SeaWorld for everything you do for us
101,2/24/2019,4,"I went to sea world recently with a group of friends. It was a nice sunny day and the weather was nice. The first thing we wanted to do was go on a ride that we saw from the parking lot. The ride was under maintenance. That was disappointing. The seal show that we saw was pretty darn good. It had an entertainer for the first 15 min or so that was funny and good at dancing. I love anything that deals with the sea, so seeing the whale show, sharks, turtles, and other sea creatures was a treat for me. I would definitely come back just to stare at these majestic creatures."
102,7/7/2019,2,"Pros: The shows (orcas, dolphins, etc.) were fun and informational. There was plenty of seating. Cons: The park, bathrooms, and restaurants were DIRTY. The trash was piled at every trash can. There was trash all over the eating areas. There was no soap in the restrooms. None. Anywhere. Â The lines and crowds were absolutely INSANE! We have been to the Orlando and San Antonio SeaWorld parks, and this was, BY FAR, the worst. It's basically an amusement park, with a few animal sights in between. Every ride was a minimum 90 minute wait for a 40 second ride. The lines for food were just as bad, only we also got a kick in the balls at the checkout once we saw lunch cost $80 for pizza, fries, and drinks. So we ended up spending most of the day in line for two rides and lunch. I would NEVER go to this park again."
103,6/1/2019,1,"We came to this place on May 31 2019. The hours of operation on the website and park were listed as: 10:30-5PM. Well, this was a lie. Most of the rides opened after 11:00AM and the best riders closed around 3:30PM (Lol) because the workers said ""it takes time to close these rides down so we do it before the park closes..""Really? Sea World charges expensive admission to the park for the entire time is posted OPEN hours of 1030-5PM, but open the rides late and closes them early ? So in other words, Sea World falsely advertises hours of operations, because the actual rides inside are open from 11:30-3:30PM. We were ripped off. Not worth it. This park has little people too. I can see why now. The food was also awful! They refunded us a chicken we purchased because every time they switched out the chicken the new chicken ALSO came out raw, bloody and watery from the oven!!! So they just gave us our money back. We feel robbed from our purchase!"
104,10/4/2019,5,I loved sea world Â we went for our family vacation and my kids loved it the habitats the shows the Â were amazing i recommend going on a weekday as it is less jam packed and you get through everything much better definitely will be coming back again in a bout a year as I cannot handle the traffic in San Diego
105,7/29/2019,3,Fun and yet a busy busy place!!!! The shows are a blast and having ribs was delicious. Everything is priced as an amusement park would be and maybe a little cheaper. Why 3 stars? The bathrooms seem like are only cleaned in the morning and not maintained throughout the day. Some of the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting.
106,7/15/2019,2,We took our 3 year old to SeaWorld and it was a so-so experience for him; probably because it was really hot that day. He rode the spinning tea cup and other toddler-friendly rides with Â his dad. We'll try to visit sometime again when the weather is a lot cooler to see if he likes it.
107,2/2/2019,5,"This is the perfect blend of an outdoor amusement park with indoor aquarium exhibits, unlike any other park I've seen. This is my second time at SeaWorld, with the first time when I was just a kid. Since the killer whale incident, I think SeaWorld has tried hard to rebrand themselves as more education-based and doubled down on their nonprofit branches for marine conservation and research efforts. It was apparent from watching the live animal shows that the animals are taught tricks that they would normally do in the wild, and that trainers do not go into the water with killer whales anymore. Key tip: when you enter the park, make sure to get an amusement park map that has the live show times on the back. Plan your day around getting to see the live animal shows; they're what make the park worthwhile. The dolphin show was spectacular, and we also enjoyed the orca show. The sea lion show was not engaging as we had expected, but great for laughs with the family. I was also quite impressed with the aquarium exhibits, as they are made so you can get up close to the animals, with moving walkways and tunnels to allow everyone to get a chance to see the animals. We also tried the Manta roller coaster (super fun, very fast, and doesn't go too high), and the 3D Artic ride simulator. For lunch, we opted for the smokehouse restaurant, which was an excellent choice. Not too many vegetarian options, but the BBQ brisket was very tender, just wish there was more meat on the ribs. Going earlier in the day means the park is less crowded, so would recommend coming when the park opens to make it easier to walk around and have less wait time for rides. The park is decorated beautifully for the holidays, so there were some good photo opportunities for the family. All in all, I was so pleasantly surprised with this visit, and would like to come back here again as well as the other SeaWorld branches!"
108,11/24/2019,4,"This was our family's first trip here and we had a very nice time. I love the holiday experience. The Christmas music all through the park, the Christmas themed rides...LOVED. The lines weren't too awful. The dolphin show although short was so cute and I loved the Hawaiian theme. One thing I will say is the whole ""ride bag"" situation. We got a locker for ride but to get one for every single ride is pretty ridiculous...esp since another ride could be all the way across the park. Meaning a new locker for each ride. Mind you this wasn't because of a backpack it was my very very small purse. Having to buy a locker for my purse for every ride was very inconvenient. So I would love a fix with that issue.Other than that we loved the rides, very creative and quaint. Especially Atlantis! You also can't beat the beautiful views right on the water. Thanks for a great day Seaworld:)"
109,5/27/2018,4,"SeaWorld! What can I say about it? Like anything in life, if you have varying and/or negative opinions about something (like some previous reviewers) then don't indulge in that activity. Why spend time, energy and money on something you know you're against in the first place, just saying. Now, for the positives! Â Our big group (teens, kids and adults) went on a weekend of a holiday. I try to avoid doing that but sometimes that's how it goes. But it wasn't bad like other parks. Let me describe it:-""Other theme parks"" during holidays; think big city (San Diego, CA)aka crowded, frustrated people into their own thing -SeaWorld; think big city (Phoenix, AZ)aka crowded, but more mellow people willing to go with the flow Â Also, SeaWorld's rides and attractions have a more interactive vibe to them. Makes it easier to 'think outside the box' and enjoy what's in front of you. If that makes any sense.THE RIDES? I liked revisiting The Bay of Play; the Sesame Street-themed rides with the kids; I enjoyed the roller coasters with the teens/adults. The lines weren't that long and moved at a nice pace. To see the ""aha moment"" on the kid's faces during the other stand alone attractions made everything worthwhile.THE WEATHER? Overcast with spurts of sun. We layered up/down our clothing when needed.THE REFRESHMENTS? The cheapest souvenir cup we bought provided free refills of soda/water was a smart move. Also, $35 to eat all day anywhere in the park sounded like a good idea (we didn't partake in that though).THE ENTRY FEE? We used the Veteran's 4 complimentary tickets deal; bought a kid's ticket on a military base for a 2-dayer. Ticket package deals online seem to be worth looking into as well.THE PARKING? We parked out there, but it wasn't a bad stroll.Overall, the day was a win. We stayed 5 hours, hit a few major rides and only saw half the park. But had a good time. Crowded, but manageable up a generally upbeat attitude from everyone. The WIFI came and went, but whatever. We'd come here again. Maybe not during the holidays, though."
110,8/29/2019,4,"My family and I go here every time we are in San Diego. This is a place that I loved growing up as a kid so I wanted to make sure that my kids were able to come and enjoy a place like this as well. We came during the off season for San Diego tourism so they had limited hours and VERY limited show times. Most of the shows only had 2 times through the day and some of them had only 1. That was a little disappointing but was not that big of a deal. We got everything done that we wanted to get done that day. This was the first time that we had been here since they did away with the killer whale show. We didn't really notice much of a difference in the energy the place had. One of the things that we LOVED was the new roller coaster Electric Eel. This wasn't supposed to open until May but they were allowing people to ride it when we went in March. We will, obviously, keep coming back here whenever we are in town."
111,5/9/2018,5,"Seaworld was definitely a keeper! We got to see a lot of different types of sea animals including dolphins, sharks, penguins, turtles, and of course the killer whales. The orcas have a formal show. There is lots of education that goes on in learning about the different animals. It is a really fabulous place for children as they have a lot of hands on activities including a petting area where they can pet stingrays, touch starfish and sea cucumbers etc. Also....an additional nice perk is that there are actually a lot of rides at Seaworld which I didn't really know about. Very similar rides as Legoland but you get all of the animal exhibits on top of that and the price was significantly less than Legoland. Honestly, if we had gone to Seaworld first, we would've probably never gone to Legoland. If you're ever in the San Diego area would definitely recommend coming to Seaworld San Diego."
112,10/19/2019,1,"This would be a great place in theory. However, The animal exhibits are dirty and not maintained, the restaurants have huge lines even on days when the park is not busy and there is really just a I don't give a crap attitude among all the employees. I would not waste your money here the San Diego zoo or a whale/dolphin watch cruise is much better. This place needs to be left to its own devices."
113,4/25/2019,2,"First of all, this review has absolutely nothing to do with Blackfish, or any of the issues brought up by that garbage of a so-called documentary. Â Actually, that's not entirely true -- many of my gripes have a lot to do with SeaWorld's reactions to Blackfish, as they have turned a once first-rate, world-class aquatic life park into a third or fourth-tier amusement park. Â As for Blackfish, please do not form any opinions about SeaWorld based on that film. Â There are plenty of other reasons to spend your time and money elsewhere.I'm a lover of zoos, aquariums, and amusement parks. Â I am also a member of two zoos and an aquarium, am a former long-time SeaWorld annual pass holder, have or have had annual passes to Disneyland, Magic Mountain, Knotts Berry Farm, and Universal Studios, and have been to about 100 zoos, aquariums, and amusement parks combined. Â In short, I'm a fan of these sorts of places, so you would think I would be a fan of SeaWorld. Â I am not.In short, SeaWorld just isn't what it used to be. Â It used to be a place where you could see an amazing variety of sea life, both large and small, and see how humans have been able to interact and form relationships with some of the biggest, smartest, and most amazing animals on earth. Â Coupled with a unique collection of oceanic and aquatic animals and some of the most impressive animal exhibits you will ever see, SeaWorld was a first-class attraction, to be included in conversations with Disneyland and the San Diego Zoo.Post-Blackfish, and perhaps more importantly, post-IPO, however, SeaWorld has accelerated the process of turning itself from the former first-rate aquatic life park, into an almost unrecognizable third or fourth-rate amusement park. Â Gone are the Shamu show, the Pets Rule show, manatees, Commerson's dolphins, most of the Aquarium de la Mer, the Freshwater Aquarium, any decent tropical reef exhibit, Clydesdale horses, polar bears, Forbidden Reef, and almost countless other animals -- beaver, armadillos, monitor lizard, mud skippers, fly river turtle, blind cave fish, and on and on and on. Instead, SeaWorld has ditched its animals for a truly mediocre collection of rides, which cannot compete with the likes of the very established amusement parks here in SoCal -- Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, Universal Studios, and Six Flags Magic Mountain.Without the impressive animal experiences it once had, and without a ride line up that even comes close to competing with other SoCal parks, there really isn't much reason to spend good money on SeaWorld. Â With tickets that are substantially more expensive than the arguably overpriced San Diego Zoo or the comparably inexpensive Knotts Berry Farm, you are much better off spending your money at one of those two to get your animal or ride fix, respectively, as SeaWorld doesn't provide enough of either to keep you satisfied. Â Or, if you are looking for an aquatic life experience, the Aquarium of the Pacific or even the Birch Aquarium will give you much better value for your money. Â In short, SeaWorld no longer has a place in the SoCal marketplace.To be fair, SeaWorld still has some very good attractions. Â The Penguin Encounter is quite easily the best collection of penguins and penguin exhibit I have ever seen. Â (Side note: SeaWorld management almost got rid of this attraction, as well, and may in the future.) Â Likewise seeing dolphins and orcas is still pretty special. Â WIld Arctic provides a pretty cool and rare opportunity to see walruses and beluga whales. Â On the other hand, the rides they have built are incredibly underwhelming. Â SeaWorld seems to be rebuilding under the ""a little something for everyone"" philosophy, which is better described as a ""not enough for anybody"" philosophy. Â Having one or two thrill rides can't compete in a region where Magic Mountain and Knotts have a host of much better quality ones. Â Likewise, having a few carnival-quality childen's rides can't compete with a Legoland park stuffed with much more inventive and immersive ones. Â In an effort to please everyone, the type of park that SeaWorld has become pleases virtually no one, and in a region filled with an amazing variety of world-class amusement and animal attractions, you will be much more satisfied spending your time and money elsewhere."
114,1/18/2019,5,"I stopped here to check something off my bucket list, seeing emperor penguins. I had an amazing time. The dolphin, sea lion, and killer whale shows are all great spectacles. The park itself seems a little outdated but it didn't take away from the experience. I also rode the electric eel coaster and even though it was short it was easy to enjoy. The park was clean and had friendly staff that made my time at the park even better. If you get a chance you should really check sea world out. The prices do seem steep but they offer free admission for military members so it didn't really matter to me."
115,5/3/2018,4,"Even having lived in San Diego for a few years, I never set foot in SeaWorld, but now was the time. So, my wife and I decided to make a weekend of it. Made the trip down from OC to La Jolla on a Friday during rush hour in an hour and 20 minutes!! That's like running a 2 minute mile!! Start to weekend: eccellente!!!Saturday morning we get up, get dressed, make the short drive down to the park. Get in and make our way to Shipwreck Reef cafe, for some tourist food, ie. overpriced and bland. The real reason we came down was because Shamu was looking for a ghostwriter for his autobiography. And I've always want to see a ghost. And So, we set up an interview. Here's an excerpt from the soon to be published: SHAMU ON THE ROCKS: An Autobiography(Hello, Shamu. It's my pleasure to make your acquaintance. Why don't we start by you're telling us about the recent direction SeaWorld has decided to go in concerning you and your brethren.)""I'm sure those aquatic do-gooders meant well, but life ain't been the same since I lost my gig on the big stage. I sometimes question their motivation for it all, though. I mean, that guy, Costanza... said he was a marine biologist. If he's a marine biologist, I'm an architect. I've always wanted to pretend to be an architect. Anyway, they took my livelihood away. Now, Im just an ordinary schmuck, like everybody else.""(You seem a little out of sorts. Has it effected you that much?)""Yeah, I've been hitting the sauce pretty hard lately. I'm up to my fins in debt due to a slight gambling problem. Those sharks have me on the books for a quarter mil. But, I was a star once. My name up in lights, had an entourage, a pod of hot cows: big blowholes. I was King of the SeaWorld. Those were good times. Then those Hollywood people came to ""save me."" And then just like that, they were gone. Attending some red carpet premiere in Cannes, they said. And wintering in Monte Carlo, on Armand de Brignac Rose and beluga caviar. And I'm left swimming in my own excrement."" (So, now that the park has turned in another direction from being whale-centric, how do you see the park's future?)""I hear the humans talking. Impossible not to. Stupid, loud-mouthed, obnoxious tourists always droning on and on about how elegant and graceful and smart those kiss-ass dolphins are. And those silly sea lions, brown-nosing for their fish. Don't they have any self-respect? The neighborhood has become a slum, just a ghetto of little aquariums and cute, little fish pimping their wares for the masses. People getting their highs on those stupid thrill rides. All of them eating overpriced, average comfort food at the myriad of slow serviced, underwhelming pig troughs around the park. This place used to be my empire, and now it's just another tourist trap that provides hours of family fun for a decent price. At least during the fireworks I can briefly forget my troubles and lose myself in the show in the sky. Where's that damn trainer with my margarita!! Humans!! Can't do anything right!!""At this point, Shamu went on a rant about penguins, which due to the language is really nonpunishable. He did give his rating of two stars for the park, mainly for the quality of fish he's fed. My wife and I agreed to bump that up to 4 stars. After a few visits it's seemed to have lost it's luster a bit. Still worth a visit. The kiss-ass dolphins are pretty cool."
116,10/19/2018,5,"First time coming to Sea World. I always wanted to go ever since I was a little girl. Seeing the Orcas was magical. They are intelligent! The show was entertaining and educational. There are soooo many! They all have different personalities. I can't wait to go back and see them again! There are a lot of different activities to do and see besides the orcas. There are sharks, dolphins, sea turtles, other mammals, and various sea/oceanic creatures to see. I saw that they even have beluga whales. There are exhibits were you can touch different sea/oceanic wildlife. Plus, there are exhibits were you can feed them as well for a small price. I got to feed manta rays. There are rides and games to play. SeaWorld is for the whole family. There is a Sesame Street section, where children can play on jungle gyms and go on small rides. There are characters to take pictures with. Plus, there is a parade that has all the favorite Sesame Street characters. SeaWorld is more than what they seem.I had a great time exploring, watching shows, and going on rides. I can't wait to come back!"
117,10/1/2018,5,"Yes, my family loves Sea World. We are also Yearly Pass holders. Admission right now is around $60 and a yearly pass is $99. So coughing up the extra $40 gets you in for a whole year and that includes free general parking. That's not a bad deal.Sea World has attractions for real little kids to bigger kids to adults. Petting pools with small fish. Fun, entertaining aquatic animal shows throughout the day. Great animal exhibits. Food and drink vendors throughout the park plus adult beverages (margaritas and beer is what I saw). All kinds of rides- roller coasters and kiddie rides. Thy even have a carnival area where can play carnival style games as well as arcade games. So much to do. It can take you all day.Always improving. Sea World continues to try and do new things to upgrade the park entertainment. They also promote taking care of our world's oceans and the animals that live in them. I applaud them for doing that. In San Diego, if your visiting for the first time. This theme park is a must. Great for young and old. Educational but in a snicky way because your having way too much fun. Again, I love Sea World. Visit soon and visit often. I am as well as my family."
118,6/29/2019,3,"So the park is better than last time I was here 10 years ago. But goodness, we are in a ""post show"" line to get a snack and there is ONE person acting as cashier and she is ALSO the person who scoops the ice cream, pours the drinks and beers etc. incredible to think they can't spare another person! Super long line and unnecessarily so!"
119,6/27/2019,2,"Evening show was really cool as well as the sea lion and otter show. However, not a lot of animals in the park, and it seemed desolate at times. This was especially creepy at night when we were the only group walking down pathways. Do yourself a favor and don't soend the money. Half the rides wrre shut down, and the obes that were opened took forever to load because worlers were so dang slow!"
120,10/27/2019,1,$25 dollars for general parking!! What a way to make quick cash . The dolphins Â shows was not in exhibition! ! Food very expensive!
121,7/22/2019,5,"What can you say about seaworld that isn't already known? Well I'll say this. IT'S AWESOME!! So many amazing animals to see and shows to go to. The sea lions show is a must see and for the night time show I'd recommend Cirque Electrique. It was absolutely incredible. Fast paced action, pumping music, lots of lights and unbelievable performers."
122,7/20/2019,1,Shipwreck Rapids Ride took over 2hrs. SeaWorld saves a lot of empty boats disproportionately for paid VIP line which was empty and rarely used.Majority customers had to wait for a Long Long Long time.Why not move some of the empty boats for regular lines???SeaWorld's manager and leadership team should make a better decision for the majority of customers.
123,12/9/2018,5,This is the perfect place to celebrate Christmas Â especially for people who are far from their families and love ones. You can really feel the Christmas spirit and it feels like home. We'll be celebrating our Christmas here this year â€
124,5/6/2019,4,"SeaWorld is a great place (for all ages) to come view the amazement of our Earth's aquatic animals. No matter how old you are, these creatures will take your breath away with their beauty no matter their size or species. Compared to other So Cal theme parks, this place is fairly inexpensive and offers a good variety of snacks, foods and drinks. The park itself is also very clean and the staff are friendly. SeaWorld is one of those places you have to visit at least once."
125,6/13/2019,5,"Recently went here on a Friday.. it had been over 10 years since I've been to Sea world, my mom had never been and she loved it. They had a special promo so we got a great price on tickets... Alot has changed since my last visit and my favorite part is that it was not extremely packed... i usually go to Disneyland because I have an annual pass, but it's always so busy. We were able to do all of sea world and the shows in one day. The park does close early during the week. But we still had enough time to do everything because the wait times were very short. We did there new roller coaster and only waited 10 mins, and the ride was awesome... SeaWorld has the best of everything and is great for all ages. If you don't want to do rides and roller coasters you can go to see the animals and the shows. I wish i lived a little closer so I could go more often. Will definitely be going back soon."
126,3/25/2019,1,"Disgusted with sea world customer service. Â I lost a shoe getting off a ride. I know exactly where it's at and they know where it's at. Was not even given any reassurance they will try to get it back to me. Just fill out a piece of paper and the look of goodluck. Â It's the whole principle of, no we are sorry you lost it and will do our best to get it to you. But a look of oh well!Yes, it's just a shoe, but nonetheless, an expensive Kirk ease brand shoes. A, we will try would've made me feel better. Â And, I would've bought another pair at their store and finished our day. I'd rather wait off campus and not give them our business ever again.Sea World! You need better customer service. Bec we spent $600 so far for 5 of us..."
127,1/2/2018,5,"My favorite and a must visit for so many reasons!- LOVE their Christmas! SO festive and the new Nativity show, O Wonderous Night has me talking to EVERYONE about it! Â SO so good! Â This will keep playing through Jan 6, 2018- So many animal rescue efforts- LOVE their shows, especially the dolphin show.- BELUGA for example! I grow to appreciate animals more because i encounter them here... Here I live in San Diego and rarely realize that just here, I can see these magnificent creatures, where never would I get a chance to see and care about them.-Food is GREAT and doesn't cost an arm and a leg- Buy an annual pass for under $9 a month AND get free parking and more with it! Â What a steal!- Rides are FUN! Â Manta is so fast! Â Shipwrecked rapids are so sopping wet and fun! -They have THE BEST VIEW OF THE BAY! Go in and ride the sky tower for free with admission. Amazingly beautiful!This is a GEM of San Diego. Â I have lived here all my life and Sea World just keeps getting better and better. Â I think they got a bum rap for Black Fish. Â Black Fish was more about those 3rd world countries that kept orcas in swimming pools, Sea World gave Shamu a huge stadium and honestly without Sea World, I might not care about whales and animals so much."
128,10/11/2018,4,My kids had the best time this week. I do have to say I am a little disappointed that for the October kids get in free deal they raise their prices-- from $74 to $92! But it's still not a bad deal. We loved the shows that we saw and the rides were so much fun. My kids enjoyed interacting with the animals! I do have to say that the app is terrible and so difficult to use!! But overall the park is a blast and my kids are begging to go back!
129,10/6/2019,3,"We visited Labor Day & had 8 free admission tickets. I have 3 more free tickets that expire Dec 31, 2019 & have no plans for a revisit. 3 stars for the free admission tickets.My son & I receive free SeaWorld admission tickets from our employer yearly, but I don't know if that's a reason to continue to return .... We arrived at 10am when the park opened. The parking was $22 & after paying we waited 1 hour in the traffic lines to park. We metal detector line was a 25 min wait. The ticket admission line was quick for our tickets were digital & were scanned on our phones.The Ship Wreck Rapids & Tidal Twister lines were a 2 hour wait. The bathroom line was a 20 minute wait & unclean. Â We arrived & left 2 restaurants because of the long lines before we realized that was the case at all the restaurants. We waited 1.5 hours in line to buy lunch. The tables were full so we waited for an empty table. As guests finished eating food trays & trash were left on the table because the trash cans overflowed to the point that trash sat beside the trash cans. We flagged down staff & ask them to clean off a table so we could sit down to eat. The flame grilled turkey legs & burgers were delicious. The Â rotisserie chicken was bloody. The chicken alfredo was unseasoned & mushy. We purchased a $15 all you can drink all day souvenir cup, but most drink machines were empty, dirty or out of ice. We waited in line 30 min to buy dipping dots ice cream & when we reached the cashier to order we noticed rust in the freezer & didn't buy.We tired of the long lines & left SeaWorld at 6pm. Our plan was to be seated just finishing up dinner when the fireworks begun at 950pm; dinner & a fireworks show.We ate dinner elsewhere & then went to the gym & swimming so our day ended on a good note."
130,11/9/2018,4,"Hours of fun for the family and little ones. There's a wide variety of activities including amusement rides, Elmo park, shows and encounters. The dolphin show and the sea lion show were by far the most entertaining and fun! Must see! The orca show was probably my least favorite as it is more informative than it is a show. Plenty of walking to do. The signage in my opinion could be better and more sign posts could help. Bring bathing costumes and a towel for little ones as there are areas in the park where they can splash. There are also large walk in dryer machines for $6 if you forgot a towel. The hours mentioned on Yelp and Google are incorrect - they close at 6pm not 10pm. Also, we got a 3 day online pass for the Safari, SeaWorld and the Zoo which was great value for money. Children under 3 are free. General parking is steep at $22."
131,3/20/2019,5,"So much fun!!! We took advantage of the weekday $55 ticket promo and purchased online so we were able to bypass the ticket line and go straight to the entrance! We arrived around 11:00 and stayed till 4:30. We had surprisingly good food at Pete's pineapple shack (?) - the kids and I enjoyed the fish and chips. The chicken strips were ok, bbq sauce too sweet. I did notice a lot of people brought in their own food and drinks. They checked bags at the entrance so don't know what they were looking for; obviously not outside food. We saw the orca show at 1:30 and it was so amazing. We went 5 min before the show started and there were still seats. Bottom 10-12 rows got drenched so beware. It was hilarious to see them get splashed so many times. The dolphin show was at 3:30 but when we got there 10-15 min before, it was already packed. We ended up standing but we've seen dolphin shows many times at other places so left after 5-10 min. Bottom 10 rows did get splashed as well. The kids play area was fun. Bring water shoes and bathing suit for water play. We didn't ride the rollercoasters but we did go up the tower for $5 per person. It was a nice view. Wish it rotated slower so I could get a better look from above. By the way, good thing we got a discount on the park tickets because parking was $30! Would definitely recommend going!!"
132,11/8/2018,3,Sea world goes against all that I believe in but daughter won a trip to place of her choosing. When we got to the gates it made more sense to buy a season pass then just the day. My daughter and niece had tons of fun on the rides. Â The shows have changed quit a bit since the last time we were here but It's still hot when you sit and watch the show though. The food is tasty at most places. The pineapple drink is delicious.
133,8/24/2019,1,This SeaWorld is dying there is only three shows a day and one at night. The food is terrible the service is nonexistent bought burger it was cold fries also cold. It use to be good oh well will never return again. Shame I use to like coming here.
134,11/8/2017,4,"I had a great time at SeaWorld. My husband and son also enjoyed it. They liked the dolphin show and sea lion show. My son had a blast playing at the Sesame Street Bay of Play. It's this whole area dedicated to Sesame Street. There's a gift shop and some huge jungle gym equipment that kids can climb on. There are also rides at SeaWorld. There's a roller coaster, and sky cable car ride over the bay. We were shooting people with these huge water cannon guns that were lined along the path of Â the ship wreck rapids ride. You put in a quarter and you can shoot the people in the tubes. Â People were giving us stares because they didn't even know us, haha. It was so much fun that I couldn't get our party to leave. I know, we're terrible, but it was all in fun. How often do you get to shoot water at strangers and not get in trouble for it? My favorite ride was the skytower. Â It's a ride that slowly goes up and down and rotates 360 degrees. You get a great view from high in the sky. We ended the night at the electric ocean show. It was decent. I wasn't impressed. They used black lights in the amphitheater. The performers wore black light outfits that made them glow. It was cool that the place was glowing in all different colors, but I was wasn't thrilled with the entertainment. My son fell asleep. Then again, we were there the whole day and was exhausted by the time the show came on."
135,10/26/2019,2,I'm only giving two stars because the animals are taken care of. This place is horribly ran. The bathrooms are some of the nastiest I have ever encountered. They hire teenagers to run everything so it takes 1 hour of waiting in line to get food. Not once but twice I waited in line for an hour after ordering food and both times my food was never made. No apology from anyone and no offer to make it for me either. Just a bunch of people standing around collecting a paycheck.
136,4/14/2019,3,A Mess!!!! Cost a fortune! Paid for dolphin interaction and no one in the park knows where to tell you to check in. Â No picture included. Â They want 100.00 more on top of the already paid 200.00! Way Â over priced and unorganized.Print your Â tickets because the app won't work in the park! In the end the actual dolphin experience was amazing. Â The trainers were kind and knowledgeable. Â The rest of the review also true.
137,3/6/2019,5,"This is probably one of the nicest family parks to attend. There are attractions that will interest the entire family. Also, you have the chance to experience close encounters with some of the animals.Whenever I have out of town guest who bring their children we always make a trip here to enjoy time together. Also, I really like the fact that they allow free tickets for military service members and their families. I highly recommend this park to anyone"
138,10/16/2017,4,"It's like the Disneyland of sea animals! Whether you're trying to watch shows, ride some rides, play carnival games or just check out the animals then this is the spot for you. Very kid-friendly and good for family trips. They also have bars and beer stands along with some good grub spread out across the park; it's lit!You can easily spend a day here at SeaWorld. Most places had lines but what doesn't these days? I honestly didn't think this place would be that popular after seeing the documentary ""Blackfish"" on Netflix. Last time I was here, I remember the Orca Encounter (aka Shamu) show was more entertaining with the tricks and having the trainers ride the killer whales in the water. Now the show is focused more on educating the crowd with facts and the trainers don't even go in the water. It was still fun to watch and kids love it! Just beware of the Splash Zone! This place got aquariums for days; stumbled into 3 that had all types of fish, turtles and sharks! There are also open pools where you are able to touch fish, stingrays and dolphins! When you're tired, there's always a place to eat whether you want to take your time and dine at one of the restaurant cafes or just grab something quick like churros or and ice cold beer. If you're near San Diego or live in SoCal, this is just one of those things you have to do no matter how old you are. Worth a visit! P.S. - they offer military discount tickets (free for the member + 3 people) and you can skip the long lines by getting your tickets in advance online, plus it's cheaper that way too."
139,8/1/2019,2,"I hope SeaWorld sees this and takes it to heart. Three suggestions to go from 2-stars to 5-stars. 1. Food. The food quality and variety is terrible. Every restaurant seems to have a slight variation of one another and it's all bad. Adults decide when to leave the park. Have fantastic food choices and we'd stay longer. My family left early to go eat elsewhere because the food choices were so poor. 2. Visible exhibits. All exhibits are hidden away from view on the walking paths. It feels like you're walking from one building to the next and it's kind of boring. More animals and attractions should be visible from the walking paths. 3. Parking. $22 is too much for parking. Sorry but you're SeaWorld, not Disneyland. If the zoo can have free parking you should be able to as well. I sure wouldn't mind spending that extra $22 on in-park entertainment.....or food...good food ;-)"
140,11/10/2017,5,"I've written over 1800 reviews and only 15 have been granted my exclusive 5 star rating. SeaWorld San Diego is #15..SeaWorld has changed for the better over the years. I'm not a closed minded liberal, or an angry Japanese whale hunter, so I have an open and unbiased viewpoint. I've owned annual passes for every park and major attraction in San Diego and SeaWorld is the best overall park for your family out of all of them. They have aquariums, a large kids area, scary rides, wet rides, shows, and FREE annual themed events like Halloween trick or treating and Christmas. This is especially true for those that buy their annual pass. Legoland is expensive and is really best for smaller kids 4-8 years old. The Zoo is okay, but their memberships are getting very expensive and sometimes smaller kids can't handle all the walking.While controversy has lowered the attendance, you the consumer scores! SeaWorld now offers a very affordable 99 a year annual pass for Southern California residence that includes parking ( a saving of $18 each visit). This was the tipping point to make this a 5 star experience. Even though attendance is down at SeaWorld, they aren't just being lazy and cutting quality. They are actually putting money into the park, making it better. New rides like Tentacle Twirl and the upcoming Electric Eel are creating new thrill experiences while slowly transitioning away from the old ""Shamu"" theme. Â  - A fun kids kids area Â ( Bay of Play aka Cap'n Kid's World) where adults can also have fun. Who doesn't like struggling while climbing rope nets? Â - Their food options are improving, and they do sell those Turkey Legs. - Â Fireworks (Summer) are best viewed from the Eastern parking lot.- While their new Orca show lacks the panache of Shamu Rocks, it is educational.Tip- If you plan on buying an annual pass membership for SeaWorld ( $99 pass), DO IT ONLINE first and bring your printout to the parking gate. You will get in free. If you buy it at the park entrance you get stuck with that parking fee.. I had to fight with Customer Service and I only got a refund with Shamu dollars. Shamu Dollars are a one-day-only voucher.. If you don't use it that day you lose it all. Shamu Dollars Tip -If you get these dollars ( good on same day ONLY) you can purchase one shot of starbucks syrup pump ( .49 cents) and get full cash back on the rest of the value of the dollar card.."
141,1/5/2020,4,"I love the killer whale show the most. It is the best! This is a must see when visiting. Other highlights are the Beluga whales, the penguins, and the dolphins. The sea lion show is also one of the best! A must see."
142,2/19/2018,3,"For full disclosure, my experience of this park was a bit skewed by the fact that I came here in the middle of the week when most of the stalls and a good portion of the main shows were either closed or scheduled very far apart from each other. If I had done some research ahead of time, I could have probably timed my experience a bit better to coincide with the various shows & presentations that they have.I went down to San Diego for a work engagement, and stayed the rest of the week for vacation. Despite having made numerous trips in the past to sunny (usually) San Diego, I never once bothered to visit Sea World. Yet every time I have a discussion with someone and the topic of San Diego comes up, I inevitably always get asked if I've been to Sea World. So this trip, I made it a point to schedule in a stop at this popular spot. First off, parking at this place is expectedly expensive. Prepare to shell out $20 for general parking, $25 for up close parking (worth it if you don't want to circle around the lot aimlessly), and VIP parking right in front of the entrance for $35. One of the first places you'll most likely hit when you first enter the park is the arcades. Catering to the inner child in me, I stopped by this place first and managed to win a Yoshi plush doll from a claw machine on my first try. Then I subsequently lost $30 playing a bunch of random games in which I lost over and over again. Other than the arcades and ""skill"" games, there are a variety of rides such as the Bayside skyride (you get to see the ""exciting"" marsh right next to the park), the Manta (the only roller coaster type ride that was open that day), and the Shipwreck Rapids (prepare to get soaked; you've been warned). Word of advice, don't go on the Rapids unless it's a hot day out, or be prepared to shell out $9 at the dry stations just to get yourself somewhat dry. Also had a chance to check out a lot of the cool aquariums and see the different marine animals swimming about. While the dolphins naturally stole the show, the beluga whales were definitely pretty cool to actually see in person. One thing I noted about all the whales however, was that they all seemed rather bored of their surrounds. Swimming endlessly in circles all day while silly tourists (such as myself) gawked and pointed at them. General admission for the park costs $69.99, however you can buy a Go Card for 7-days admission for $67.99. Overall, if I had kids, this would probably be a fun experience for them and a easy way to spend the day together as a family. However as an adult, it is definitely one of those things I do once just to experience, and will most likely never bother doing again."
143,11/28/2019,1,Terrible place- people are rude here and rides are average--- plus the conditions for animals and fish atrocious - no sense of appreciating guests and making them feel welcome - don't waste your money!
144,8/5/2018,3,"SeaWorld has a lot of animals to see, but a lot less than what I had expected. Â I've seen more sealife and animals at other aquariums like the one in Vancouver, BC. I also wasn't expecting to pay $22 to park the car, on top of $89 for an admission ticket. Â It costs another $5 for the Skyride and other rides as well.There were no orca shows, and there were no shows going on during the day when I was there. Â The park is open 10-10, but to only have shows going on right when they open and then only in the early afternoon versus throughout the day isn't cool.A few of the tanks I saw were dirty and needed maintenance. Some of the food stands were closed in the middle of the day. It was a long walk just to buy a drink.If you leave the park, you can get your hand stamped at the gate for re-entry. They opened up a roller coaster this year, which is small."
145,4/27/2019,4,"I'm from Orlando, FL. My expectations of amusement parks is high. Out of all the amusement parks in SoCal that have a comparable one in FL...this SeaWorld wins. I much prefer this San Diego location. With 2 young kids who love Sesame Street this location is always a hit! Also, I feel that the animal exhibits are designed much better than the one in Orlando. The only thing that is a negative for me is that you have to pay for the Skytower at this location. The one is Orlando is now free."
146,3/21/2019,5,"People complain too much. All these people who are nagging about prices have obviously never spent an afternoon at Disneyland or any other park. I have a blast every single time I go. Prices are actually cheap compared to most parks. All employees have been so nice and knowledgeable. Rides are SOOO fun and never a bad wait time. Between going to the safari park and sea world ive learned so much about conservation. Let me just say now I feel like the Blackfish documentary 100% way over exaggerated. You can tell the workers love the animals and all they do to try to save them. They definitely do more than Peta. Rides are amazing, Food is delicious, Animals are so cute and active, and employees always willing to help/teach. Great family fun and will always recommend!"
147,10/13/2019,3,"I was not impressed with this place. Â And this is MY OPINION.....I thought the parking was overly priced, $25! Â Really?!?!? Â They ran out of park maps by 1:00!!! Their food is not good for the price you pay. Â I do not plan to go back. Â I'll just stick to The San Diego Zoo where the parking is free and more to see"
148,7/6/2019,3,"So disappointing. I brought my six year old son here for the first time today. I should've gone elsewhere!! CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!1. Overfilled trash cans 2. When I had paid for 3 orders of Baja fish tacos I was later (10min) told that they were out of fish. They asked if I wanted a quesadilla instead... ummm no. I then asked how long it would be until it arrived... her response ""it will get here when it gets here, I don't know what to tell you!"" Another client complained about flies on her food, same employee said ""we serve food outside, there is nothing I can do about flies."" 3. Employees push to sell the refillable souvenir cup, but they fail to inform you the park is out of Co2â€4. I noticed another guest asking a different employee about a corn dog stand. Employees response... ""i don't know, does it look like we have corn dogs here?"" Â I was embarrassed I heard that conversation. Luckily I knew where the hand dipped corn dog stand was located so I gave the guest direction. 5. Food lines are a joke. Everyone is so disoriented and unorganized. 6. Restrooms!!!! Gross and unsanitary, completely trashed. There is no pride in any of these employees. Everyone seemed annoyed, unhappy, and dazed. I think the only ones I saw smiling or having a good time were the ones in the parade and the animal trainers. I strongly believe employees are a reflection of management... Shame in you Seaworld San Diego! Â I'm so glad the shows were great... Biff from the Sea Lion Live Show was AMAZING!!!! Â Seaworld needs more people like Biff."
149,8/6/2018,4,"We spent about 6 hours here during our summer vacation.We enjoyed the park very much. Here are a few things to remember in case your planning a visit here.1. Get the entrance tickets in advance as you might get a discount 2. Don't buy the front of the line special if your visiting during week days,and if you decide to get the you can always go and purchase it anytime while your there.3. Make sure to see most of the shows, the dolphin show was the best one.remember the first 5-10 rows are wet zone, meaning you'll get wet during the show( bring a shower hat in case your worried of getting your hair wet like I was.....but on these heat a little wet is probably welcomed by many people.4.reserved seating means that you have only reservation for a section instead of actual seat... so I wouldn't bother getting it.Make sure to bring hat since all the shows are in the open without any overhead cover , so your sitting in direct sun( not recommend it for infants or very small children)I can not say anything about the restaurants and the food since we returned back to our hotel to have a late lunch.If you can make sure to take Uber there instead of driving your self, there is a designated area for drop off and pick up by Uber so it is made very convenient and easy."
150,9/21/2019,2,I was so excited to go to sea world but very disappointed the food services and way-finding components of my visit. Wayfinding was very difficult. I was there on a summer Sunday and the food services were understaffed and underprepared for the crowd. There were 30 minute wait lines at the Explorers Cafe with only 2 of the 5 potential registers open.
151,8/5/2018,4,"SeaWorld. I've grown up at this place. Haven't been here in years and it was crazy to see how many changes they've made. First of all we bought season passes which were $9.99 a month per person which is affordable for any budget. No blackout days and free parking included. They also give you 10% off the food if you don't buy the all you can eat passes. We walked in and saw there were a few roller coasters. Â Eel, Manta, Atlantis, etc. Really cool roller coasters. Although the shamoo show is gone, there's still plenty to look at and do. Many exhibits. Many animals. Let sharks, fish, etc. We had a good time. Just the weather wasn't on our side that day. Super hot and humid."
152,8/19/2019,1,"It's pretty sad out here. The staff is super lazy. We're in line for ""Electric Eel"". They keep allowing singles over and over without making any attempt at all to fill the seats. Hopefully the day doesn't continue down this road. The fact that rides open at 11 and that the park opens at 10:30 is crazy too. You want us all to pay top dollar to just stand around? Last thing is parking. You should be ashamed of yourselves for charging for general parking. That's just rude."
153,8/21/2018,4,"The shows are amazing! I appreciated the positive training, the environmental awareness and the focus on rescue animals. Â One can see that hours and hours of training go into each performance. Â In addition to the educational aspect of the shows, there are also rides.The roller coaster rides are a lot of fun. There's a roller coaster for everyone. Want to get wet? Go on the spinning river ride or the deep drop into the water on the roller coaster -.......the lines aren't bad either, especially when it's hot outside.The sky needle charge of 5.00 a person is a tad unreasonable when one has paid admission and parking Â for 4 people. Â Your competition Disney and Leggoland don't do that. And the food there is awful, just awful. Â As a captive audience, we were trapped. Won't happen again though as despite your rule of no outside food in the park, we saw quite a few other families pull sandwiches out of their backpacks. Â All in all, we had fun, despite the horrible lunch."
154,3/19/2019,5,"This is one of the best places to take your kids. We took our toddler here one time and he had a blast! even if he was just walking in circles, he enjoyed looking at the aquariums. There were not much people that day so all attractions were not packed. We will take him here again when he's older."
155,10/7/2019,3,"I always have a great time with my kids at Sea World. There is one down fall sometimes, the kids ride area may be short staffed and one operator will need to man 2 rides making wait times doubled. They need to cross train some broom people to cover these times"
156,8/28/2018,5,"Ok. I have a soft spot for seaworld. When we lived in socal our kid was young and we would take her to seaworld a few times a month. Lots of good times. Now, sadly, most of the shows are long in the tooth. So, why 5 stars? Â Two words - cirque electric. Wow did that show blow me away. The acrobatics, use of light, water etc were amazing. Loved the jet ski action. And the music is infectious. Could watch that show every day (and now i/you can on you tube). New additions to the park include way better food choices than 2001-2006 when we lived here. Atlantis isn't that new but it is cool. Manta is a solid coaster. New one is insane!!! Â Freaked me out. One and done . Wifey and i still love pets rule after all these years. YMMV"
157,2/20/2019,4,"This place is fun. We had a good time. We came after the heavy rains so it was not too busy when we went. I was afraid that Shamu show would be terrible after the changes. The show was pretty good. The new background screen is really impressive. I learned a lot. It was more educational and the orcas did the normal Shamu things. All of the rides, attractions, and animal habitats were well maintained. My kids had a good time and enjoyed the play areas. This place is not as expensive as Disney but it is expensive. Bring extra money. It was $22 for general parking. For lunch, We had 2 burgers 2 kids nugget meals and 2 beers. It was $101. Plan your day before you come. That way you can be sure to see all the shows."
158,10/14/2019,4,"A fun spot for the whole family. Lots of attractions to see and do. The animals here are really cool and you get the chance to learn about them through the educational info they provide for you. The food here is typical for an amusement park, nothing special."
159,9/30/2019,5,Sea World is an amazing and wonderful park! Â I love all the work they do for the environment and conservation. Â They balance the fun and thrills of a theme park with educational aspects. Â I've been a pass member for nearly 10 years and have enjoyed all they bring to San Diego and to the larger community as a whole. Â My only wish is that they upgraded more sections of the park (ie the really old looking Penguin Encounter) and added a bit more aquariums and such since they took out the freshwater aquarium.
160,7/2/2019,2,"Color me totally disappointed. While I haven't been to SeaWorld in many years, I expected it to be better and even more fun than ever. It was not. First of all, regular parking is $22 - not as much as some places, but still have to factor it in. Then, we had to stand in line to go through security for over 30 minutes. We got inside the park (finally) and it was uncomfortably difficult to figure out where to go. Instead of having small pools and attractions - there are a couple insignificant ones - there are dozens upon dozens of small understaffed food stands. We went there on a Sunday in late June and a good half those stands were empty. It made the park look somewhat deserted. We also noticed how much trash there was on the ground and didn't see anybody picking it up. It felt dirty. BTW - restrooms = gross. We finally found the orca whale exhibit where you could watch them swim - I was surprised at the amount of algae on the viewing glass but maybe that's normal. There was not a soul there to ask questions of. Saw the seals/sea lions - not impressed. Went to the dolphin show - totally underwhelming.Now for the food. After looking at a few of the places to eat, we settled on Shipwreck Reef Cafe. The food was actually pretty good there - we had the rotisserie chicken. Finding a cashier there was tricky - a sign or two would have helped.Overall, a big disappointment. Glad we didn't pay for our tickets. We used our free Veteran's tickets."
161,3/23/2019,3,"This placed turned turned into a wonderful place to spend your day in to the saddest place you can be in. On the brighter side, I am glad they are now focusing more on protecting animals. I am a member for a while and I have seen how this place changed significantly due to a change in administration. The Dine all day was a big promo to save until they decided to you can only avail of it every hour. So if you are so hungry, you have to wait for an hour before you can eat again. Now if you buy a souvenir, you now have a choice to have it put in a bag, only you have to pay 10cents for the bag!!! Seriously? What's next Seaworld?!!!Update 3/23/2019Oh boy!! It can only get worse!! Not only they raised up the prices for the food, servings are down to have. Just imagine your kid so hungry and getting a meal of 4pcs chicken nuggets and 5 pcs of friesâ€â€. Â Mine was for pcs of thinly sliced briskett!!!! Its getting better Seaworld!!!"
162,1/5/2018,4,"Grew up and San Diego and going to Sea World has been a rare thing. Â The last time I've been was over 17 years ago. Â We decided to bring in the new year with a Sea World annual pass.Upon entering the park has changed a lot. Â The park has always been really nice as far as appearance and well maintained. Â We arrived during Christmas time and enjoyed all the Christmas decorations. Â I wish we had been able to see the park at night with all the lights. Â Sea World has always been a marine park, but it is evolving to more of a theme park. Â One of the most recent additions has been the Manta Roller Coaster and they are in the process of building another coaster (Electric Eel 2018) There are also a lot of smaller carnival type rides perfect for kids. Besides the rides Sea World is a mixture of animal shows inside amphitheaters and animal exhibits. I enjoy the walk through encounters like the penguin and shark encounters. Â The open exhibits that are sea life touch pools are great too. Â I have to say the high light was riding Manta. Â The coaster was really thrilling, but at the same time great for families. Â From the moment you launch off it is an exciting ride with many twist and turns.We were able to watch the Dolphin show while we were there. Â It reminds me of how I use to remember Sea World and it was entertaining and fun to see the animal acrobatics. Â Overall Sea World annual pass is a great value and they have a host of different events going on through out the year which gives you a reason to come back."
163,10/15/2019,5,Absolutely love it here! Just became annual pass members and it's so worth it love to just come during the week for a couple hours! Workers are always so incredibly friendly and the waits for anything are never really to long great place to come!
164,7/5/2019,1,"What a disappointment. First; rude staff on several occasions. Twice in parking lot before we even got into the park. Having staff roll their eyes at us as we ask if there is a spot closer for disabled parking. Second; filthy. Garbage everywhere and bathrooms that smelled like sewage was backing up into them. Third; food service. You'd think they weren't expecting anyone today. Not to mention running out of many food items in the middle of the afternoon. Go to get food and then be told they don't have: lids, straws or trays. Try carrying 4 orders of food and drinks back to your family. The sea lion and dolphin shows were good, but, not enough to salvage the day. I will likely never be back again. Save your money and go somewhere else."
165,10/13/2019,5,"We purchased 3 in 1 ticket for SeaWorld, SD Zoo and SD zoo Safari park. We got there around 11 a.m. and left after 8 p.m. one can have so much fun with different shows, rides, aquarium areas, encounters with sealife etc. Great experience overall."
166,7/29/2019,1,"I grew up going to SeaWorld and it was well-maintained and pleasant to visit. Our family visited on 7/27/19 and we were very disappointed. The bathrooms were filthy. We waited for about an hour for a grab-and-go cafeteria dinner. We requested a cheeseburger without the burger (for a vegetarian) and the staff had to check with the management to see if they could do this. We told them we were okay with paying for a cheeseburger. Eventually they approved but required a staff member to escort us to the cashier to explain the ""custom"" order. It was so crowded that we could barely move from place to place. The aquariums were crowded, stuffy, and uncomfortable. It was generally an unpleasant experience. Some in our party already have complex feelings about SeaWorld and their holding of orcas. We support their rescue and rehabilitation programs though. This experience has soured us on patronizing the park and we won't be back."
167,9/28/2018,3,"I feel a bit torn with this review because growing up, SeaWorld was my favorite, as it combines an aquarium and a theme park together. It still kind of is, but it seems like it is aging and getting stretched thin as it attempts to compete with the rollercoaster driven theme parks as well as trying to keep up with taking care of its inhabitants. I just went this past weekend, and have the following comments:---- In the freshwater exhibit, there was a turtle which had parts of its shell coming off, an indicator that perhaps the turtle was not being taken care of as well as it could be in the exhibit.---- The turtle encounter portion seemed to reveal that turtles weren't as happy (perhaps).---- A bit inconvenient that folks are forced to rent out $1 lockers to keep stuff in order to ride Manta, Atlantis, or Electric Eel. While not ""a lot"" of money to spend, this could add up!---- We found it convenient to have a plastic SeaWorld cup option to refill alcoholic beverages. I think there was a small discount, too. ---- I thought the pineapple cup for the frozen strawberry margarita was cool! (Pictured)---- Shamu Show versus Orca encounter: Given the tragic events that have happened with the orca (as shown in Blackfish), the show has changed since my childhood with the team members riding the orca and doing tricks. Long gone are those days. Orca encounter aims to be more educational, of course with the water splashing all still very much incorporated.I mean, of course I'll eventually return... but it's still heartbreaking."
168,9/1/2017,4,"There are three questions you're probably wondering about SeaWorld:1. Is it worth visiting as an adult without kids?There's plenty to do for adults and not just those with kids. The key is to pick the right day/time of your visit. I recommend mid-week (Tues-Thurs) in any month but June, July and Aug.2. How long will I be at SeaWorld?Assume it will take most of your day -- at least 5 hours.3. What should I do and in what order?OK this is the interesting one. First, the setup: Buy your tickets online to avoid lines at the park. You should arrive at SeaWorld at 10am when it opens. This is key for parking and planning your day. Buy the general parking and don't pay the extra fee for ""park up front"". Since you've come early, it only saves you 3-4 rows. If you can't walk that far, you're in for a looong day. Be sure to wear plenty of sunscreen as you're outdoors for most of the day.Here's a suggested order:* When you first come into the park, stop at the touch pool. You can touch a variety of sea creatures, including urchin and and sea stars. But the highlight has to be the Cleaner Fish. They nibble on your hands with tiny bites. See how long you can keep your hand in the water.* Next stop, SkyTower. It's a double decker rotating pod that acts as an observation deck. Unless the fog is in, you'll have fantastic views in every direction.* Now head over to Dolphin Point. On the way, stop and watch the sea otters play. You can't get as close to them as you can in the Monterrey Bay Aquarium but it's fun watching these playful creatures. If you get to Dolphin Point by 11am, you should be able to see a feeding and even touch a dolphin. You can also pay extra for the personal dolphin experience.* You're next stop is the Dolphin Days at 1145. You need to arrive 20 mins early to get a good seat but be warned that you'll get wet if you sit in the first 10 or so rows. This was my favorite show of the day.* On the way out of Dolphin Days, you should head over to Sea Lions Tonight. It's a kitchy spoof of Saturday Night Live -- and a bunch of movies. The two starring sea lions, Clyde and Seamore, are pretty amazing.* Now you are free until Orca Encounter at 230. Grab some lunch, get on a ride, or just wander around. As you might expect, the food is pricey (you're in a theme park, what do you expect) but the quality is pretty good. I can recommend the Calypso Bay BBQ Smokehouse -- although ordering is confusing. We appreciated that there were vendors with fresh cut fruit wandering around the shows.* You can leave after Orca Enounter which means your day is over at 3pm. Five hours in the park.I should point out that all of the staff are very friendly."
169,4/19/2019,5,I forgot how much fun this place was! We enjoyed our visit so much that we upgraded to the One Year pass. We use to buy the passes when the kids were little but now they are all grown up and we thought that we would not need to do that...wrong! It is so much fun now to just get away and enjoy the park while we walk around with a beer in hand. This place is a perfect get away. Love it!
170,6/9/2018,5,"Growing up in SD, I've been coming to Sea World since I was in Kindergarten. Now having my own kids, we've been season pass holders for years. It's well worth it to buy the annual Fun Pass since it's the same price as a one day ticket. Â It's changed quite a bit since I was little, always improving their parks. The most recent remodel is the Ocean Explorer area to the right of the entrance to the park. This area has more kids rides. Eel & octopus aquariums and the most recent addition of the twisty and inverted roller coaster, the Electric Eel. It's like the El Loco ride at Circus Circus (if you've ever been) but smoother, in my opinion. I always enjoy coming here for a few hours for some exercise and seeing all the marine life and animals. Must do if you're in San Diego."
171,7/7/2018,5,Loved sea world! There's rides & shows! The manta ride was super fast but fun! Also I love going on the sky lift where it brings you above the water and you can see everything. Make sure you get the map & check the times the shows start. The dog show was good & I loved the shamu show! If you sit in the front you will get wet. Also get tickets online they are cheaper. Also if you go during the week it's cheaper. Also if you want to take pics in the park at certain areas I suggest a pic card(flash drive) it's cheaper & you can print your pictures or put on your computer. There's a spot where you sit on a fake shamu and with a green screen & it looks like you are riding shamu. Great park for kids and adults and for families.
172,7/29/2019,1,"It's official. Â Professionalism is out the window and it's all about greed with this park. Â They have outrageous and ridiculous fees (Look them up). The parking fees are even more ridiculous. Â They have ridiculously long lines for everything. Â I suggest SeaWorld accommodates its customers with service to match the fees charged. Â Expand the park, the staff, the restaurants, the shows, and the rides. Â I do not pay to stand in line the whole day. Â Please clean the place as there are filth and trash everywhere. Â Send someone out on a regular basis to sweep, clean the tables and refill the condiments and utensils. Also through no fault of the park, the birds around the park are now swooping down and stealing our food REGULARLY so be careful."
173,12/26/2018,1,"I have platinum passes for my family..today was the 2nd time i got in the electrical eel with my 12 yr old and we were riding the ride my son belt Â flew off it was the scariest thing ever. The ride tech said im sorry whats that gonna help?? . i had to hold him down the whole ride. Was the scariest thing ever i will NOT renew my passes again..so disappointed.. now i have these bruises reminding that i could of lost my son.. i have bruises on my right arm, it was the beginning of the ride when his belt popped out.. please ask questions look at the reviews Â before going in any ride.. this was not my first visit to sea world but after this idk if i can come back"
174,7/9/2019,2,After visiting SeaWorld in the first time in years I was soooo disappointed!!! There were hardly any animals to touch in the touch pools. Everything was so dirty!! The glass on the aquariums were so dirty you couldn't see through all the fingerprints! There are NOT enough bathrooms for everyone they let in! There are also not enough trained employees working the stands. I can't tell you how many employees I saw mishandling food. They are so unorganized it's sad. Not able to do simple tasks. Also there were several rides that were down! And just today as I'm writing this review I saw on the news that people were stuck for 3 1/2 hours on the skyride! What is going on here?? Are they not investing in maintaining their property? Or do they they need to pay more money to their employees to attract capable employees or what the issue is but I doubt we'll go back. It's NOT what it use to be!
175,11/12/2019,2,"Oh good ole Sea World. Being born and raised from San Diego we would always take field trips here. Â It has been over 20 years since I have been back until a couple of weeks ago. We have a four year old and we buy memberships every year to different theme parks. This year we thought heck let's do Sea World since I haven't been back in forever. Â While entering the park there were trash bins that were overloaded to the point where there was trash on the side. Â Well that was a bad welcoming sign. Â Then we have customer service line right when you enter that took forever because there was only one person working the desk, so the wait pretty insane. Â Next, my child had to use the restroom after standing in the long wait at customer service and oh boy that restroom was disgusting. Â Although my family and I enjoyed our time there I felt there was lack of cleanliness at this park. Â I've been to several theme parks and it's sad to sad as a resident of San Diego this place needs a lot of up keep."
176,10/12/2019,3,To start off this is not what you pay for. There is basically no animals and it's basically all amusement park so if you want to see only animals I would not recommend this. I would not recommend this because if you don't like amusement parks you will not like this. Also if you don't know how to read a map that well I would not go because Some even the park workers don't even know their way around so I would not go if you do not know how to read a map. Also the food was horrible. Overall it wasn't really a good experience because there's basically no animals and their food was horrible.
177,11/22/2017,4,"The place is fun! Â Started out our So. Cal. Adventure with SeaWorld to start slow and take things easy. Â We ended up staying for almost 8 hours. Â There's lots to do, lines we're short (Thanksgiving week and still was short), lots of fun shows to watch. Â The kids wanted to get wet, so I learned the front row center is where to be if you want to get soaked. Â Also, the dolphin show is the wettest. I'd recommend packing a jacket and keeping it in a backpack to keep warm when the sun goes down. Â I'd also suggest doing shows and wet rides to start the day, dry off in the sun and do all the other activities after. Â Bring a Hydroflask and pack snacks. Â There's places to refill all over and people are cool enough to put ice at food joints. Â Food is pricey and it's not good. Â A small personal pepperoni pizza is $10.99 and a little container of pasta with sauce is the same. Â I tried the Chicken Caesar salad, and the chicken was canned! Â Enjoy!"
178,4/21/2019,5,"Overall a great experience. Love the orca show. One of the best soak zone moment ever. These majesticAnimals really has enormous strength. Super fun and educational for the little ones. Love all of the touch pools and feed zone. The manta ray touch pool was AMAZING. My little one had a blast and already planning to come back. I say skip the seven seas tasting event. Mediocre food and small drinks. Do the all day if you're really hungry. Don't drink alcohol bc you'll get sun stroke like I did :(. Still I love it- will be back in 2 daysIn my myOpinion, They're just missing a tidal pool."
179,7/20/2018,2,Very old style. Too expensive for the kind of service. Not worth to spend the money to playã€‚ and it cost $89 per person at least! You have to pay for skyride and other games!
180,8/7/2018,5,"Getting hotel next to Seaworld is useless. The park opens at 10am, so you'd have plenty of time to get there from farther parts of San Diego. Probably not the best place for kids under 3. My 2.5 year old couldn't sit through the whole show. However, he did like most of other attractions. I wish they had a break room where you could have the kids take a nap. After few hours, my baby was exhausted so we had to leave. Do wear a hat. I burned my face lol.Pros: Great family vocation place and friendly staff. Cons: Not enough healthy and organic choices and no nap place for kids."
181,8/3/2018,2,"If you have a toddler, I would suggest going somewhere else. There is really not that much for them to do. The Sesame Street area was pretty dull. Our son was too small to play on the majority of the structures. The only area he could play on had 5 stuffed blocks and a semi-bouncy floor. Also, SeaWorld just isn't what it used to be. I loved going there as a child and now it's run down. We went on a hot summer day and they don't have misters anywhere. The stores barely had AC running. The water in the animal exhibits was murky and it was just boring.We basically wasted $200 ($22 for parking) for about 2 hours of boredom. Wish we could get our money back. Such a let down."
182,7/14/2019,3,"This trip was the complete opposite of our last one. Family of 6. $360 ish for tickets because I'm crazy at finding deals, $22 for general parking, $120 for lunch with an hour wait (1 register stopped working and they just merged it into the one I had been waiting in) then after a 70 minute wait at the electric eel was told I couldn't get on the ride unless I purchased a locker for my mini purse! So now my family is having a good time and I'm sitting alone doing nothing, because I refuse to spend more money to lock up my money. On the positive side I will not be coming back, so I'll have plenty of spending money somewhere else. It's been one thing after another since we got here."
183,8/7/2017,4,"SeaWorld was great, a lot of the timed shows are entertaining, but there needs to be more shade for the outdoors shows. Even with sunscreen on, it gets hot pretty fast on humid days in San Diego when the sun is just beating down on you. It's not as hot as the sun in Phoenix, but it's bad enough to cause sunburns. I'm sure staff can relate to, a lot of them are wearing gargantic-sized hats.Nevertheless, they really strive to keep this place clean which says a lot about a place that has a high volume of foot traffic... And kids! Kids make messes.You can drink alcohol at this place, just show your ID and you can get a 16 oz beer... For ten bucks. Ugh! That's amusement park pricing for ya, and it's because of these types of charges that deter me from coming back to SeaWorld on a more regular basis, even with the opportunity to purchase a lifetime pass. At the time of this review, it is $12.03 a month which calculates to about $144 a year for one single adult. This still does not justify the price point of ten bucks for a can of beer. Check out the penguin exhibit if things get too heated on the surface level. The penguins need to be kept cooled indoors, and so will you when you enter the place. Brr!ALSO protip, purchase the tickets online ahead of time, you will save almost nearly half off. At the time of this review, purchasing tickets AT SeaWorld costs $94.99 per single adult, but online it only costs $59.99 per single adult. As some other Yelpers have stated, sometimes their site can have availability issues."
184,8/28/2019,2,So disappointing!! This park was so beautiful when I was a kid. Now you can see how the corporation is trying to keep it afloat Â by adding rides. What do rides have to do with preservation of marine life? Â Also did not care how on the weekdays all merchandise stores are open but not too many food options & they don't allow food in. Â Too expensive & not worth the money...go to the SD zoo or wildlife park. You re bound to see a lot more!
185,8/3/2019,5,We visited here with our 2 kids and had a great time. Â Took advantage of weekday tickets at a slightly discounted price. Â General parking wasn't too far of a walk. Â Great shows and fun rides. Â It was better than we expected honestly. Â We were able to take our time enjoying as much as we could. Â Of course the food and drinks are way over priced. Â We Â shared a turkey leg and bought a refillable drink. Â Great vacation attraction!
186,10/5/2019,5,Sea World has definitely been one of our favorite places to enjoy a day out with family!
187,8/16/2017,5,I love Seaworld. Â I have been several times to the one in Orlando and this one. I never get tired of watching the sea animals. My favorite is the peguins. Â I also love that they have alot of different performances. From the dolphins to the Seals and the Orca entertainment. I highly recommend if your going to make a day of it to get all day dining deal pass. You can eat every hour until closing for $35.00 for adults. It is well worth it. You could easily spend that on a meal for Two on one occasion. If you can stay until it get dark to see all the cool lights. Â They also gave a DJ performing at night with people dancing and it's pretty at night. I enjoy the water rides and Â the Bayside skyride. Make sure you don't bring any plastic straws. Â I understand it's Â for the animal safety. I saw them make a lady toss them. It's best to purchase your tickets on line for faster service to avoid the long lines. We definitely would return again and please don't forget your sunscreen!
188,9/9/2018,5,"I wish people would boycott all my favorite places, that way there'd be far less people crowding up our experience. We had such a great time here! All the animals were beautiful, looked happy and well nourished, and all the care takers were very friendly, knowledgeable, and seemed to know exactly what they were doing. Also I had no idea how many animals you could actually touch! The rays, sharks, horseshoe crabs, and my favorite part were the cleaner fish.The rides were great, too! We rode the Manta Ray multiple times with virtually no line! And the new ride The Electric Eel was incredible, too! I don't know if I've ever been that nervous to ride a ride like that before!The best deal by far was their all day meal pass. We were stuffed every hour of the day with their incredible deal to get an entree, side/dessert, and drink. And the food wasn't half bad, either... with the exception of their personal pizzas from the sunken ship cafe which were bland and undercooked.I could definitely see myself coming back again. I hope Sea World sticks around for along while because I had a great time, and I know everyone else did, too."
189,7/13/2019,1,"This is for Sea world customer service- via the PhoneWE ARE A PLATINUM MEMBER who paid the full price but when I called then I was on hold trying to get someone for 1 hour. After that hour, I requested one of my benefits is to get 50% discount on Animal encounters and she read it off to me and confirmed it. I proceeded to give her all the 4 kids information including their shoe size and suit size for about 30-40 minutes and then when I was ready to buy it, she told me oh sorry our system says you only get 10%. When I asked for a manager, I was on hold for another 30 minutes. Then the manager was incompetent and was not able to help me. When I ask him who is above him he said no one. This managers name is SHEVAN - 9151. He couldn't speak English very well. I had to repeat myself at least 4x. If you are a Sea World decision maker, I want you to know that I will not be renewing our platinum membership and will spread all my experience with you guys with everyone I know. We have other options here in San Diego- you should revamp your membership benefits. Your phone customer service sucks. It's the worst people I have dealt with in my entire life. Rude, not helpful, incompetent, and unprofessional."
190,8/8/2019,1,"What a joke this time around. Now they lowered the price by a dollar or two and then they charge another six or seven dollars for additional rides Â inside the park. The tall sea world ride that circles the Â park to see what's going on is now in additional six dollars. On this last trip we just left, three of the new bigger rides were broken down and two shows were canceled. Seaworld is been really bad, I'm now they nickel and dime you for everything. Stay away if you possibly can. Go to the zoo, much more informational and a better family event."
191,6/28/2019,1,Just sharing. Â I puchased the all day food meal deal and it took one hour in line food. Poor customer service. Â Be Aware
192,7/19/2017,4,"Went here yesterday with the kiddies. Of course ive come here a few times as a kid.. but as adults, husband and I decided not to go here after seeing a certain documentary... eventually, we caved in and decided to bring the kids. Despite all the controversy surrounding SeaWorld, I think its a great place to take the kids.We went on a busy summer weekday. It's a big place, but not huge, so walking from one spot to the next with little ones was easy. You can easily spend a whole day here if you take advantage of everything they have to offer. We watched 3 shows, the Orcas, Dolphins, and sea otters. The revised Orca shows focuses on educating the audience. Â The sea otter show is quirky and funny, while the dolphin show really shows off their speed and talent. These shows demonstrate just how smart and amazing these creatures are. You can see how much the trainers care for them. There's also a big emphasis on all of SeaWorlds work outside of the park. Others things to do at the park... we spent some time at the arcade area, winning tickets redeemable for prices... and also hung out at the Sesame Street area where there's rides for small kids and different play areas. The petting ponds close to the entrance occupied the kids and my hubby too! Haha Out of all the exhibits, the shark one was our favorite. You go down into a glass tunnel under the water and watch the sharks swim all around. Prices for trinkets and souvenirs are actually not too terrible. There's also a lot of items on sale for 40-50% off! I got a cute little snow globe for less than $5. They don't use plastic bags, so you can get a paper bag for 10cents, or a cute reusable bag for a dollar or more. There's a bunch of snack vendors and food options around. We spent a ton on drinks during this visit since our trip was unplanned and we didn't bring our own. So yea, definitely save some $$ by bringing lots of water and snacks. Also, bring sunscreen and wear hats and protective clothing!!! There are SOME shaded areas. But you're sitting out in the sun during all the shows and going from one exhibit to another.. the sun was brutal the other day. Cover up!Check online for promotional deals. We paid $59.99 Â for one day, plus $10 more for a return ticket"
193,1/5/2018,5,"If you love sea life and entertainment, this is the place for you. Every time I visit San Diego, a stop at SeaWorld is a must. I really enjoyed the Seal show, along with the Dolphin show and orca show. The shows are not only very entertaining but they also provide you with informative facts. As for rides, they definitely cater more to the younger children, but there are three rides one can do for thrills and beautiful views."
194,8/22/2019,2,"The worst customer service and most frustrating I've ever experienced! Ended up not using their quick queue service and went to GS for a refund which they said they could do just for them not being able to because they ""couldn't pull up my receipt"" told me I wouldn't get charged ,which I did, and if I did to call a number. Called and they told me they couldn't do it and I'd have to go to the park after being on hold for 30+ minutes. Go to the park and they finally do the refund except it's been a week now and the money still isn't in my account and it doesn't take that long for a refund to go through. The money came out of my card quicker than it's taking to put back after being told that they would do the refund smh."
195,6/18/2018,3,I thoroughly have a great time when I go to this place but I have such a heart for the animals that are there and the possible mistreatment. But I'll leave a review anyways from my experience. Just went with the wife and wow do they have a lot of stuff to do here. I'm glad the killer whale shows are no longer going on but there is plenty more to see. They have other shows and events all day long it seems. They take care of the military too which is great. Make sure you go in the tower that takes you up and up and up to the clouds it seems to see all of San Diego! What a view from up there! They have a winter show as well but have never been. Can't wait to see what it will be like. But kind of weird to have a winter wonderland in San Diego no? Lol
196,7/31/2019,2,"Our visit sucked. Granted, I know better than to visit a theme park on a weekend. But when you're about to head to the workplace to get ahead of business on a Sunday and your cute-as-a-button daughter asks if you'll take her to Sea World instead - you go! First of all, parking is expensive. That would be fine, but if I pay $22 for the lousy spots in the back of the lot, it shouldn't be a scene from Mad Max immediately after passing through the payment booths. It was this day my friends! A total fuster cluck! To summarize my remaining beefs, corn dog and beer booths didn't open until deep in the afternoon, a decision based on the arbitrary whims of the employees, it seemed. Everything was crowded shoulder-to-shoulder and fellow English speakers were few and far between! I'm no xenophobe, but it's a fact that customs of courtesy vary from culture to culture. For example, queuing to receive a service - face painting, for example, required a bit of aggression. And for the cost of admittance, that shouldn't be an issue, in my estimation!"
197,6/11/2019,1,"Park and shows were great; however, their customer service sucks!I already bought Sea World San Diego park tickets through Costco.com. Upon arriving at the ticket booth, I was told the tickets that I had purchased from Costco.com cannot be used because the top shows Aquatica San Diego (another amusement park owned by Sea World) instead of Sea World San Diego. I explained to the staff that this is how it shows on the eVoucher from Costco, but the eVoucher is definitely for Sea World San Diego. Â The staff wouldn't scan my eVoucher tickets and insisted that I had to purchase four new tickets if we want to get in. Â We drove two hours to San Diego, and waited another half an hour in line to get tickets. There's no way that we will just go back without visiting the park even though I was unhappy about it. Â My kid, wife, and parents in law were all exhausted setting in the hot summer. Â So instead of arguing with the staff and create a scene. Â I purchased four new tickets at Sea World's website in front of the gate at a much higher price comparing with Costco price. Â I tried to resolve this with Sea World by calling them first yesterday, after waiting for over an hour, I was told to e-mail to swc.guestrelations@seawoâ€¦ instead. So I e-mailed them yesterday, but it has been over a day, and no still response. Â I am very upset about the experience with Sea World, and I swear that my family will never go to any of the Sea World's parks."
198,5/14/2019,2,"I have been to SeaWorld San Diego many times over the last 5 years and I have never had a bad experience until today. The employees there are so incredibly rude, not a single one looked like they wanted to be there or enjoyed there job, first of all the park was extremely low staffed today (Tuesday) the manta ride was supposed to open at 11am and there was a huge line still at 11:15 we spoke with an employee at a food vendor nearby and they called someone over the walky talky, the man on the walky talky told the employee to tell us ""the ride was having technical difficulties, even tho it wasn't they just didn't have enough staff for it at the time and it would open soon"" I don't think the man on the walky talky knew we could ALL hear him! So we left the large line and went to do other things.  Â  Â The women working at the kids teacup-like ride was super rude as well, telling us to ""hurry, come on, everyone is waiting"" when we were walking up to the ride with my 2 year old (the gate was closed so how were we supposed to know to come through it) then she tells us our party was ok to all go in the same teacup/jelly fish thing and then yells at 2 of us to go in a separate one.  Â  Â  The next ride in the kid area was ""Elmo's flying fish"" they had one guy operating 2 rides (again short staffed) when he came to let us through the gate he told me I needed to put my son down and if he wanted on the ride he had to walk himself and I could hold his hand, like WHAT?! He was not joking and had the most disrespectful tone.  Â  Â  Â My aunt and uncle spent so much money to take our family to sea world and it was a horrible experience, the food and parking is the highest I've ever seen, even more than Disneyland. To feed the sting rays or seals it's 9$ for 4 fish!!!!!!!!  Â  Â  I will say the trainers and shows were good and the ONLY reason I am giving this a 2 star rating. I really hope SeaWorld steps it up. So disappointing..."
199,6/18/2018,3,"Family Friendly shows, lots of sea life, and food everywhere. Not the cheapest ticket in town, but the fish got to eat! The shows were great as always, and although they have gotten bad press the last few years, they do make a point to remind you of how many animals they have rescued lately. Food and souvenirs are very expensive. But I will point out, $20 for Parking seems a bit much, especially when the SD Zoo is still free!!"
200,9/1/2018,5,"7 years later and I finally went again, so time for an update! Â This place has really improved. Â It's a combo of a zoo, museum, and amusement park all in one. Â The landscaping, structuring, and ambiance of the grounds are amazing. Â The Electric Eel and Manta rides are thrilling. Â I especially like Electric Eel! Â I see that the Wild Artic simulation ride hasn't changed one bit. Â It's just like the cheesy one at Disneyland called Star Tours. Â Unfortunately, the Sky ride and the SkyTower charges $5 per person to ride it nowadays, but at least it's for a good cause. Â However, they already charge $70 for admission, $22 for general parking, a $9 service fee for buying tickets online, and now $1 for the lockers to store our belongings to ride the rides. Â What else are they going to charge us for?! Â They've got several rides there now, but I hope they never increase their admission anymore because then you might as well go to cheaper Knott's Berry Farm or Disneyland.We ate at the Calypso Bay Smokehouse. Â It was pricey like all amusement parks for pretty mediocre food and small portion sizes. Â There are a lot more gift shops than I remembered, which were nice. Â We didn't see any shows this time.Well, I'll probably be back in another 5-10 years!"
201,7/5/2019,1,Wow what a bad day for SeaWorld San Diego. We expected it to be full so we purchased the all day dining passes. It was like SeaWorld didn't expect a crowd. Restaurants were extremely slow with food quality being at an all time low for us as a family. The fastest was over 30 minutes and slowest was almost 2 hours. They didn't even apologize for slow service. It's been a few years since our last visit. We will definitely stay away for an even longer time this time.
202,2/19/2019,5,We went the last day of Presidents' Day weekend. My favorite time to come to Seaworld. They always feature the Chinese new year with lots of festivities. Lines were not that bad only 30 minutes at the Manta roller coaster. Electric eel was not bad either. Lots to do and you get a 10% discount and free parking with silver membership. We now have fun card so we will definitely come back!
203,9/7/2019,2,Purchased premium passes for me and a group of friends to go to Sea World as we have done in the past. Was told the platinum pass did not include fast pass as was stated on the website but the good did. So frustrated that I paid more money and got less with this pass. I don't need the parks outside of the state to be included. I thought with the highest pass you would get the same perks. You can't let dolphins any more. The shows are not as good as they used to be and much shorter.
204,7/18/2018,4,"Wasn't a huge fan of some of the rides, but there's so much to see and do otherwise. (Make sure you wait until the end of the day to get on the water rides or you'll be a soaked mess for the rest of the day). The dolphin and Shamu shows, touch pools, aquarium tanks, seals, beluga whales, sea turtles. Although the park gets crowded with buses and buses of people coming, it's laid out so that wait times for shows aren't really that long. The shows in my opinion are the thing to see"
205,7/1/2019,2,"Half of the rides are closed, food stations not open, beer vendors saying dont buy the beer cause its warm...... the most disappointing attraction in San Diego"
206,9/20/2017,4,"Sea World was awesome! Â My best friend and I spent most of the day here last Saturday while visiting San Diego. Â The park was not overly crowded (shocking for a Saturday!)--most attractions did not have a huge wait line--and it was a fairly clean park too.The exhibits were great--from getting to see the penguins to the sea lions to the sharks to the beluga whale--the overall experience was pretty cool. Â My favorite was the sea lion and otter live show (Clyde and Seamore)--it was so entertaining, hilarious and well-performed by the staff and the sea lions! Â You can also feed the sea lions (different ones from the ones in the live show) by purchasing a $5 tray of 4 small fish--be careful though, there are birds nearby that are eyeing for the fish as well--my friend was in the middle of feeding the sea lion and a bird swooped down and stole the fish right out of her fingers!! Â TWICE!!! Â It was hilarious though.Our pass included the Bayside Skyride--the cable car ride--so that was cool to go on and get a great view up above of the park and Mission Bay. Â The Skytower also gives you a great view of the entire park--it continuously turns in a 360 degree slowly, as it rises up and goes back down. Â We checked out the DeepSEE VR: Orca 360--which you do have to pay extra $10/person--it was really neat to get a virtual reality experience with the orcas. Â The room for the VR was really cool looking but the head gear was really heavy and the 360 degrees chairs were really hard to turn all the way around--I was struggling throughout the video! Â Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to see the orca show. Â I would recommend anyone visiting the area to check Sea World out!"
207,7/5/2017,5,"An 8 and-a-half hour day at SeaWorld only felt like 3 hours!!! This was my very first time at the park, so I'm not sure how it has evolved over the years. My experience was that it is clean, environmentally friendly, spacious, and offers a variety of things to do for all ages. We bought the ($20) all-you-can-eat pass and it was well worth it. You can use it once per hour, and choose from their basic meal options. Some things are not included and do cost extra, like ice cream, cotton candy, funnel cake, beer and wine, but that is to be expected. There is plenty of seating for all the shows that are included in the price of your entry ticket. You'll find lots of rides go on, cool exhibits to walk through, fun gift shops to peruse, cute games to play, and ample opportunities to get wet! SeaWorld, thanks for a great vacation, we'll be back next year!"
208,8/2/2019,1,Be aware that SeaWorld has one of the all time worst theme park money grab scams ever. Unlike every other theme park I've ever been to SeaWorld doesn't allow you to bring your backpack on a ride and leave it in a cubby like. Instead they force you to pay for a locker which is $2 for the first hour and $3 for each additional hour. So if you bring a backpack or purse you have to pay SeaWorld $2 or $3 dollars an hour. SeaWorld you suck!
209,9/15/2018,4,Great for kids and family. Lots of kid friendly activities. This is my third year being here. I'm a us navy veteran and never knew about the waves of honor tickets. But since the time i knew. Every year now is sea world time for my wife and kids. Thanks sea world for the yearly free tickets. You have entertained my family countless time. I salute you for your kindness. All veterans should go to sea world. Its free why not. Sea World rocksMr-Shiny.Com
210,11/16/2018,1,"The newest non rollercoaster ride closed without notice. A lot of shops are closed even on weekends. About a week ago the rapids ride was completely drained of water like a skate park. The VR thing only existed for about a week.Sometimes the food carts run out of basic things like ice and napkins. My favorite employee responses:""Oh yeah no ice and I'm not sure how to get more"" ""There's napkins over there (vague head nod to another restaurant)"" ""I don't know where forks are to be quite honest"" The parking attendants are not sure how to direct traffic. The dolphin show is laughable in a bad way. The holiday events are hyper Christian. I've been sitting in an hour long line to get into the ""PASSHOLDER EXCLUSIVE"" Christmas event tonight. Probably because five lanes merge into two in the parking lot. Or because everyone has a pass because it's desperate times around here. Also the last time I was here we noticed that even the ducks look sad.PS the behind the scenes penguin tour is cool as heck. The only redeemable thing."
211,7/17/2019,1,We are from San Diego and our grandkids visited from out of town. We thought we would give sea world a try. At every opportunity they try to trick you into giving more money. We went on a weekday and it wasn't busy so they slowed down the lines to trick you into buying a front of the line pass. 3persons were loaded into 8 person cars. 1/2 of the cars were taken off line. 4 rides were broken down. They advertise on a monitor $7 for a front of the line then after purchase charged $17 ea. Â I will never come back and will never recommend. I hear the new management has made the company more money and now I see how.
212,8/1/2018,3,I know people have issues with SeaWorld but I must say I had a lot of fun. There was a lot more to do than I thought there would be. Their food quality could be better though. The current vendors had a lot of stale food that had been sitting for a while. Also the beverage stands were out of ice and the water play area at the kids area did not turn on until later in the day. Overall I would say I had a good experience though and I did buy a season pass so I will definitely be going back.
213,9/7/2019,4,"I was there Wednesday with family and had a great time. The Â only Â thing that needs attention is the food. I feel that the food trucks would be a much better option than what the park offers. The price for food at the park is overpriced and barely traditional junk food. The Starbucks coffee is consistent pretty much wherever you go so the one here at the park gets a 5 star rating ( I prefer Peets coffee over Starbuck). A beautiful place, great rides Â and of course nice weather ( San Diego right ? ). It happened to ""sprinkle"", thunder and lightening for a short time while we were there."
214,6/2/2018,5,Beautiful Sandiego. Sea world is just a bonus!WhalesMonkeysSharksStingraysRides. Lots of fun.
215,11/12/2019,1,"I visited sea world on 11/11 with my wife and 2 year old daughter. As my daughter wanted to ride the elmo's flying fish, we waited about 30min in line and finally it was our turn to get on and it was around 3:30pm. When we were about to go in, the operator told me to have my daughter walk very very rudely as if he was mad or upset. Even if it didn't make sense at all to have to let her walk, but I didn't want to make any trouble with him against him being very very rude and bad attitude. But, my daughter was very sleepy and tired, she didn't want to walk. But the operator talked to my daughter to walk with fucking ugly face. Guess what.. my daughter started to cry and she refused to ride that. I tried to tell him that you should be a little more kind to kids, but he kept ignoring me."
216,6/19/2019,1,"Very disappointed today. Drive all the way from AZ with family visiting from London and Canada, and most rides and attractions were closed. Got to the park at 11AM we left at 1PM. Ship wreck closed, sky tower closed, bayside skyride closed. paid over $245 4 tickets and food not worth the money."
217,2/22/2019,3,Not bad but nothing spectacular either. The whale show def was my favorite by far. I feel they don't have enough rides to consider it to be an amusement park maybe an aquarium. Food isn't bad bought a meal voucher so that helped. I would come back just because it's a chill environment
218,7/1/2019,2,"Not worth the effort and cost.$60 for parking if you want to park reserved up close to entrance--really?They have come up with so many ways to extract more and more money out of visitors--want reserved seating, head of the line... $10 for 2 small icecream drumb sticks, geesh.Really there's only a few shows and a few exhibits, that's it. But the park is full of places where you can spend more money.When you add up all the costs and dealing with crowds I find its not worth it. But Sheepeople will do what others want to do, so they all decend into crowds and pay what others pay to be able to do what others do.Put some friggin benches around the park and add some shade over the bleachers."
219,8/10/2019,5,"We had so much fun at sea world. It was a low stress day for my family. We were staying at an Airbnb nearby so we actually went back for the night time CIRQUE show which was amazing! They only have one show time of the day and it was definitely worth the return visit. My son love the dolphin show and I really liked the shark exhibit. The staff person there was really knowledgeable and told us new fun facts about sharks. We used our go San Diego pass to get in which was a great value, no waiting in line at the initial ticket counter for us."
220,11/1/2018,5,"This was my second visit and I am really impressed. Â I can't quite fully remember my first experience but the memory I have wasn't all that great for some reason. Â It might have been my first encounter with some feisty seagulls that swooped down and stole my churro from me though. Â Anyways, I don't remember there being the huge kids playground, or all the rides. Â I can't believe all that is included in the admission! Â Whether if you're a tourist or a local, everyone can enjoy themselves here. Â There's interactive feel/touch pools with fishes and baby sharks. Â Loads of sea life animals to see. Â A huge playground/clubhouse area for kids to play, small or big. Â Carnival type rides that are all themed around ocean/sea life. Â Yummy foods. Â Educational signs, and park employees. Â I mean seriously, wow! Â We had gotten our admission through the city pass we purchased and every penny was worth it and then some. Â I'm so glad my family got to visit and we really enjoyed every minute we were here from open-close. Â They literally had to kick us out because we didn't want to leave. Â I just hope we covered the whole park because there was so much to see and do. Â If I'm ever in the area I will definitely make it a point to visit again."
221,3/5/2019,5,Such an awesome destination for families. Â Easy parking. Â Great variety of activities and good food! Â Plus its never very crowded. Â And its a gorgeous location!!
222,1/3/2019,3,"Very mixed feelings. Â It's very Christian, one CEO is also a Chick Fil A guy, so it comes across in their branding and messaging, especially around Christmas. Â It's very pricey, and you definitely pay for everything you do outside the general activities. Â Food is expensive and not good, and the workers are not very nice, although we found exceptions. Â The Orcas have collapsed fins which can be a sign of distress and captivity. Â We left earlier than expected, it was not busy but my kid just didn't want to hang out longer. Â We did enjoy the shark and turtle exhibits. Â She did LOVE the play structure, so she got some great exercise. Â The Sesame Street area was her favorite, so next time we will skip the animals and go to a play place. It will be cheaper!"
223,3/3/2019,5,"This place is fun for the whole family, l bought a membership for Seaworld and Aquatica park which will be opening soon for summer. The price point was great!! they have different memeberships which can be paid in Â monthly payments. Mine is about 15/month and free parking. There are several attractions and shows. I noticed this place is better for older kids that enjoy rides, however toddlers will still get to walk around and explore in a safe and clean enviroment. Overall the price is great ,place os beautiful and its something great to do with your little ones."
224,11/24/2017,5,"Almost the same as when I was a kid coming here. 5 stars for the fun and seeing the animals do amazing tricks,1 star for the poor animals being trapped for everyone's entertainment. Me and my nieces like it here better than Disneyland. A more outdoor beach feel to it. More educational as well for the kids to know about ocean wild life. And it's not as big of a rip off as Disneyland haha at least here you won't waste your whole day waiting in lines.Dining with Shamu is also a fun amazing experience. The food may be the greatest but not really dining with Shamu for the food haha"
225,8/15/2019,4,"We love Sea World even some the issues that have taken place with sea animals not being showcased or performing. My mind is at ease with the fact that they do so much for the protection and awareness for sea animals. Â Anyways that aside, the park is beautiful. I just love all the plants and flowers but the concessions are under staffed. Â Been here on 2 occasions recently and both times there was no ice for soda and they were out of a lot of soda."
226,4/29/2019,2,"This place is sad. It feels wrong on so many levels. I will not go back. Between the captives and the trashy attendees... Well, I hope SeaWorld gets shut down. It is a place to eat, drink beer, and see animals kept I small stinky environments."
227,4/21/2019,5,"Really enjoyed the day here! Got to see the three main shows--sea lions, dolphins, and orcas. They have rides, a playground for kids, tons of interactive things for everyone, and really entertaining shows. The only downside is that you can't bring food in, only snacks. The food inside is very expensive and not really for vegans or vegetarians. Other than that, it was very good!"
228,11/24/2019,5,"My family has been very Â impressed with Sea World. They have a lot of good shows , animal experiences, and fun coasters. I have been to the park for both the Halloween and Christmas celebrations. My daughter has a great time at both! The Christmas shows were entertaining and Â so much fun to watch! I really recommend watching the Cirque show and Winter Wonderland Ice Skating Show. You can't miss those shows! Sea World really goes all out for Christmas with their decorations and entertainment. Buying the season pass is so worth it."
229,6/21/2019,5,"Today we took our Grand daughters, Â (3 girls between the ages of 12 & 16) to Sea World for the day. Perfect weather and what a fun and exciting time was had by All. The Most Amazing time was had when we went to watch the 8pm show of Cirque Electique..... OH MY GOSH IT WAS SO FASCINATING AND EXCITING, Â actually the BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN...There are No other words to explain it but AMAZING!!! Sea World hit it right ON. If you haven't seen this show You Are Truly MISSING OUT....I'm telling you there is No Show Better. Don't Miss this one..."
230,7/3/2018,3,"For the price you pay for your admission, you would think more things would be included....they aren't. So many things cost extra, and it starts with the parking fee. Its a money grab for sure. The food wristband is basically a waste of time....not money, but time. It is better to have a big breakfast before getting to the park and then just get snacks (popcorn, pizza, pretzels, fruit cups, chips) throughout the day at the quick snack areas. You will waste an extreme amount of time just standing in line at one of the cafes that honor the food wristband. All in all, you will spend just about as much money....but the time you will save will be an incredible amount and so worth it. The stroller parking areas need to be set back from the main pathways. When a show lets out, its a huge mob in the stroller area and nobody can get through on the walkway. The shows were good, the rides were fun....but all in all its one of those places that you can say ""been there, done that.....DON'T need to do it again"". Next!"
231,6/20/2019,4,"We have gone to SeaWorld two times in the last three years. Â The kids loved it and enjoyed it. Â The Bummer:However, we were recently there (June 2019) and they now charge for the Skytower which is a major bummer. Â We are already paying an admission to get in and now they want an extra $5 per person to go on the sky tower. Â That would be another $25 to take my family to do that. Â Two years ago that was free. They should also consider putting covers over the arena to provide some shade during the hot sunny days.Overall we enjoy SeaWorld. Â This is a park you can defiantly do in one day."
232,6/29/2017,5,"I appreciate their rescue and education program, it's evident throughout the park exhibits. Food Â and drink are expensive but you can purchase an all day dining package which is much more affordable; even better, pack a lunch and bring your own water there are plenty tables available to eat your own food. Wear your walking shoes, there's lots to see and do.There are rides for the little ones in the Elmo area, an arcade, and the Manta roller coaster is fast and fun!"
233,8/27/2019,5,"If you're a California native,SeaWorld has always been great but their new shows are absolutely amazing."
234,4/3/2019,1,"The last time I was at Sea World was about 15 years ago. Â At the time, I was concerned about the well being of the animals and was skeptical of their claim that it was really a rehabilitation center for animals. Â Yes, I watched Black Fish when it came out and it caused more concern. Â I have two kids now, 2 and 5, and decided to give Sea World another shot.The first thing I noticed was the outline of a huge roller coaster on the skyline as I pulled in and parked. Â We entered the park and went to the small kids pools. Â This is where my kids loved the park. Â Simple, interactive, and hands on. Â We continued on and I was appalled at how the park has morphed into an entertainment park. Â This wasn't a rehabilitation center for animals. Â This was a money making park tailored specifically for the masses.Rides were everywhere and they have plans for more. Â They are attracting a wrong target audience for an animal focused park. Â They are attracting people who care for rides and thrills. We attended a dolphin show and I was struck with the same feelings I had years before. Â Small enclosure for the animals, doing tricks for people. Â If they really are rehabilitating animals, they don't focus on it, nor do they portray that to people. Â I received zero information on how they are doing it, zero to little information about the animals themselves, and had nothing but rides and food thrown at me for which I care for neither.Sea World is no longer what we all assumed it was. Â It's a theme park to make money. Â The animals are commodities. Â Before you go, watch Black Fish again, and then spend your money elsewhere.I wish I hadn't gone."
235,8/26/2019,5,We recently went to Sea World and one thing I liked was the new deal you can buy when getting your tickets you pay extra get a bracelet and then can go to certain food places that except it and get a meal once an hour or just a drink your choice. This saved us a lot of money as we went to all the shows during the day enjoying Sea World once again.
236,11/21/2018,4,"Another enjoyable day at the park. I do have to say I was a bit disappointed with my experience in purchasing my Grandson (3 years old) his own annual pass. When we arrived we had to wait in the bag check line for twenty minutes, (no complaints, I understand and appreciate the need for this check). We then moved to the ticket line to purchase his pass. We did not use the ticket Kiosk for his pass since we wanted to use the payment plan. There were well over 100 people in line to purchase tickets. There were only four registers open. It took us over an hour to work our way up to one of them. Once we got there the process was very quick and efficient. I just felt that with the size of the crowd purchasing tickets that they should have had a few more stations open.We moved over to the entrance lines were we encountered another wait of 20 minutes. We ended up waiting almost a total of 2 hours from the time we entered our first line and entered the park.We had a great day enjoying the park and look forward to returning, hopefully to less wait times to get in to start enjoying ourselves."
237,8/25/2019,5,Sea world is great. The people have fun and the rides are great too. We went to 2 shows. They were awesome as usual. You should try it out.
238,9/3/2018,3,"Way back in May I spotted a deal through ID.me which offered free admission to SeaWorld for active / retired military and up to three other people through the end of June. Â ID.me also offered $10 off the SeaWorld Dining Plan ($35.99 adults / $19.99 Ages 3-9) and I recommend getting the plan if you are going to be at the park all day because the average price of a meal is around $20 with beverage.Rohlinism: Â Amusement parks are the only places which treat a 10 year old like an adult!My first suggestion is arriving at the park early because if you paid for a full day's admission (I didn't, but you will), you should get a full day in the park. Â The other reason to arrive early is you can avoid being tempted to pay for Up Close / VIP parking. Â We arrived an hour early half by accident (we thought the park opened at 9am) and half to avoid the weekend traffic on the I-5 to San Diego. Â We were parked less than 200 feet from the main entrance ( yelp.com/biz_photos/seawâ€¦ ) without any additional fees. Â Our early arrival provided us with an opportunity to go Guest Relations and get our wrist bands for the Dining Plan before the park opened. Â The staff provided us with the check in location for our Beluga Whale Interaction. Â One thing we noted is the computer hardware for Guest Relations is in serious need of an upgrade as the park worker getting our wrist bands had to go to three computers before she found one that would properly start up. While you are waiting for the park to open, you can check out the tidal pools:( yelp.com/biz_photos/seawâ€¦ )( yelp.com/biz_photos/seawâ€¦ )Once the park opened, we watched the SeaWorld staff feed the Orcas, before feeding ourselves:( yelp.com/biz_photos/seawâ€¦ )SeaWorld has discontinued its Orca shows, but you can still see these large sea mammals either by signing up for an Up-Close Tour or by eating at one of the buffets offered by SeaWorld (hopefully there is something more than frozen fish on the menu).We walked by Dolphin Point on our way to breakfast at Pineapple Pete's and noticed a big change since our last visit. Â SeaWorld used to sell fish which allowed park goers to get some up-close time without signing for the Interaction Program. Â SeaWorld has stopped selling the fish and if you want interact with the dolphins you have to pay $65.00 for the Dolphin Encounter or $215.00 for the Interaction Program, but at least you can stare at them for free.After our breakfast, we visited Wild Arctic ( yelp.com/biz_photos/wildâ€¦ ) and the Penguin Encounter ( yelp.com/biz_photos/pengâ€¦ ) before hitting up Calypso Bay Smokehouse for lunch. Â After lunch, we headed for our Beluga Whale Interaction which ended up being the best part of our visit. Â After the Beluga Whale Interaction, we visited Turtle Reef ( yelp.com/biz_photos/seawâ€¦ ) and Shark Encounter ( yelp.com/biz_photos/seawâ€¦ ) before ending our day at Sea Lion Point. Â Turtle Reef has hawksbills and green sea turtles along with thousands of tropical fish. Â The exhibit is interactive with Turtlelink a touch screen map with SeaWorld's conservation efforts and Race to the Beach which is an educational video game. Â Shark Encounter is a 280,000 gallon exhibit housing several species including sand tigers, bonnetheads, blacktips and whitetip reef sharks. Â The most impressive part of the exhibit is a 57-foot tube running the length of the habitat and provides the best view of the sharks.In addition to the attractions I have mentioned and reviewed, SeaWorld has (16) rides with varying level of thrills and (10) show and presentations including a nightly fireworks show. Â Showtimes are posted online or listed on the complimentary map available at the park entrance.SeaWorld would improve with some upgrades to their hardware throughout the park and some of the shows and presentations could use new material / stunts. Â The better half and I enjoyed our day at SeaWorld, but I don't see a return visit anytime in the near future!"
239,6/22/2019,2,It's been 10 years since I've been to Sea world and it hasn't changed all the shows are the same it's a big disappointment to see that there is no creativity in Sea world
240,10/12/2019,1,Worst customer service. Â Waited 30 minutes to but water to be told try are warm as we never put in cooler. Â Asked several people for directions and they said they didn't know. Â Payed for beluga interaction and told to arrive early and staff showed up to greet after 2. Â We we worried we were in wrong place. Â Then brought back and waited 20 minutes. Â Saw staff and photographers catching up. Â Horrible horrible. Â Need remedial customer service course
241,2/20/2018,4,"I feel bad after watching the documentary blackfish and then going to Sea World....... but I had a great time lol. Although there aren't many rides, the few they have are fun, but the stars are the animals of course. The killer whale show was my favorite. I was shocked at how close the trainers gets to the actual whales but they seem to know what they are doing. Although I would feel Â partially guilty, I would definitely go back!"
242,10/18/2017,4,I usually don't go to Sea World until relatives from out of town come for a visit. But this time we came for a leisurely day without a big group. It's not super crowded now that it's past the summer rush but there will always be people with the weather in San Diego being good for the majority of the year. The Park isn't huge so one can see most everything within a day if some planning is done. The Orcas are more of an exhibit now rather than a show but everything else remains the same. With rides like Atlantis and Manta they've added some roller coasters to inject some thrill for older kids and more is on the way. Construction is ongoing for a thrill ride with an electric eel theme. That should be fun. My favorites will always feeding the Sea Lions and the penguin encounter. All in all a good place for young families to spend a day.
243,12/18/2018,4,I went to the one in Orlando so it was a must that I go to the one in California but regardless the big kid in me doesn't stop
244,7/10/2019,1,"Never coming here, definitely for little kids. Plus this Australian guy operating a ride had to be a jerk and tried to kick me off the ride when they clearly accepted another girl's purse. He definitely made the experience sucky as a whole. Never again, definitely will be spending my money elsewhere. Too bad they never got shut down like they were supposed to years ago."
245,11/25/2018,1,Seriously!!! We paid to put our dog in their kennel and we come to pick her up and no one is there??? We have been waiting for almost 10 minutes now. This is unacceptable. We have an hour drive home and can't even get our dog. Super irritating!!!!
246,8/5/2017,5,"Yeah, I know there's controversy surrounding Sea World after the documentary, but there's also two sides to every story. I hear a lot of good things in regards to the well being of the anomals from people who work there as well, so I'm not boycotting them for now. They let veterans and their families in free once a year, which is a nice gesture, and one we benefited from. The kids, especially our five-year-old, were amazed throughout the day, as were my wife and I. There are some pretty amazing shows, from the pets show to the illumiNight acrobat show in the evening. The orca and dolphin shows seem to have been scaled down, probably due to the bad publicity, but some of the other acts definitely made up for it. It is pretty awesome seeing orcas and dolphins up close, and some of the other sea life you'd probably never get the chance to see otherwise, from the walruses to the (what we called) ""tickle fish"" that surround your hand upon putting it in the water and tickle you with their kisses. We had a fun and memorable day. I'm sure the kids will be ready to go again soon enough."
247,7/15/2019,2,"Our experience at Seaworld today was great, the Sea Lion Show was very cute and the Cirque Electrique performers did an AMAZING job! We purchased the All Day Dining and the food was just ok, the pizza was disgusting.(Don't get the pizza, waste of time) The most upsetting part of our day was waiting in the Shipwrecked Rapids line for THREE HOURS, while the employees carelessly did their jobs. The rafts seat 9 people, these lazy ""workers"" Seaworld calls employees were putting 3-5 passengers on at a time. Leaving PLENTY of room for other guests to get on. There were a few occasions where empty rafts went by just because the employees didn't have guests ready to board in time. The approximate wait times posted were completely inaccurate. If we would have known this ride was going to take 3 hours of our day, we would've not got in line! We missed the Orca show at 5, because of this unnecessary hold up. Even more disappointing to get to the front of the line to see about only 2 employees actually working(not organized at all) while the other employees were chatting on the side. So many guests were very upset along with myself, because 3 ridiculous hours of our day were wasted because of employees that lack training and organization!! It seemed like it was every employees first day on the job."
248,5/30/2019,5,We brought our two year old here and she had a blast! We came during the week so luckily the lines were not long at all. We were in the Sesame Street area and there's an area for the kids to play and get wet. She had lots of fun in the the water and afterward it was very easy to dry her off with this machine they had. It was about six dollars but you stand inside and it blows warm air at you until you are dry ( a good 4 minutes) this was very convenient and made it easy for us to keep dry and continue going on rides! The shows were awesome as well. Very up beat music and lots of fun to watch.
249,10/10/2019,1,Seaward is somewhere in between a nightmare and a bad lunch. Â Customer service is nonexistent. Â Enter at your own risk.
250,6/10/2019,4,"How refreshing it is to experience SeaWorld over Disneyland! SeaWorld first of all acknowledged veterans today. Disneyland could care less. It wasn't beyond a packed crowd. Lines were quick, grounds were beautiful, tons to see as well. You could actually do and see everything you wanted. Unlike Disneyland, where the lines, crowds and chaos challenges you every minute! I only give it four stars because the food is good, not great. The merchandise is priced very reasonable. Disneyland has turned into an overrated money pit. I grew up with Disneyland, but it has become a money pit that has became to big for itself. It's been fun Disneyland, but greed has ruined you. God bless venues like Knott's and SeaWorld who still remember why we enjoy this country and our veterans!!"
251,5/26/2019,2,My kids love SeaWorld and we spent the day there yesterday and I noticed something we didn't notice the last time we went. They only have a very few restrooms with changing tables in them. I went to 5 restrooms trying to find one and when I did it was broken and out of order. It's crazy that a company that has thousands of customer walk thru it's doors dose not have changing tables at each restroom. After finding one that was in working order all the parents waiting to use it had the same problem.
252,7/13/2019,5,I love how the waves of valor program gives myself and my family a break to visit the park. Granted I worked with the education department before serving so I know how much Sea World does in and outside of the park. I've been able to educate those who watch Netflix specials and ignore those who forget how many Animals this company has not only helped but saved and how many marine biologists first learned what they wanted to do from coming to this park. Thank you Sea World for your contributions across the world.
253,6/9/2019,4,"I was skeptical about going to sea world after hearing all these stories about abuse. Â I finally decided to go with my husband yesterday. Â It was probably one of the most amazing experiences Ive had at a amusement park. Â It was very clean, well organized and we got to enjoy many rides. Â The Dolphin show was the main reason we went and we enjoyed it so much. They are soooooo adorable. Â We had a great lunch, they have lots of good selections and by the time we got home it was late evening and we both crashed. Â I am so glad I went despite the negative comments I have heard. Â I definitely don't regret it."
254,4/23/2019,5,"For today's review, we have Sea World San Diego. This is a park that's commonly ignored by coaster enthusiasts as it's treated as a credit whoring park. And on the outside, it looks like it is. However, this is NOT a credit whoring park in the slightest. In fact, this is probably one of the best theme parks I have ever been to. No, I'm dead serious! I love this place so much. So what makes this park so special? Well, first of all, it's home to Manta which is a FANTASTIC coaster and is one of the best launched coasters I've ridden. On top of that, they have Electric Eel which is an okay Skyrocket II and Journey to Atlantis which is a top tier water coaster. They're also getting Tidal Twister this year and a B&M Dive Coaster called Mako for 2020. Besides coasters, this place also has Shipwreck Rapids which is one of my favorite water rides ever since it has an incredible layout and you go through a waterfall! They have two other rides which are Wild Arctic which is a Star Tours like motion simulator with a cool walkthrough attraction at the end and Riptide Rescue which is a fun flat ride. So they don't have too many rides, however, they do have a good collection for what they have. They don't have a single bad ride that's operating, they do have one crappy dark ride called Submarine Quest, but it's SBNO and will probably never reopen. For their dining selection, they have Shipwreck Cafe which serves all sorts of food and they have some other unique dining options outside of your typical theme park food. They also have Baby Back Ribs, Salmon, all types of chicken, and quite a few other nice dining options! I highly recommend getting the dining pass BTWSea World is also famous for its animals, and man do they deliver! Not only do they have some cool exhibits, but they have some incredible shows! They have the Clyde and Seamore show which is incredibly funny (be sure to show up 30 minutes prior to see the pre-show which is extremely well done.), they have a dolphin show (Which I wasn't too fond of but then again I'm not into Cirque du Soleil which is what the show is mostly about, so that's my thing). However, the park had 2 other shows that are unfortunately no longer there. Pet's Rule which I love since I'm a huge dog person and their Orca Show. Both of these shows used to be amazing but unfortunately, the Orca show was downgraded into a simple exhibit where you learn about the whales instead of watching them perform with the actors and stuff, and Pets Rule recently closed a few months back and the theater is currently sitting vacant. Now, this isn't Sea World's fault, they didn't make this decision to get rid of those shows. No, they were forced to because of Blackfish. Oh how I HATE that god awful pile of propaganda with every part of my body. Seriously SCREW BLACKFISH. This pisses me off almost as much as when the Irvine Comp closed down Raging Waters and when Universal Orlando got rid of Dragon Challenge. It's BULLCRAP. Alright, enough of the rant. Back to the reviewThe park itself looks beautiful. It's got an amazing setting as it's right along the coast of San Diego. So you're going to get some amazing views of the ocean! The weather is usually bright and sunny, the park in general looks super nice as Sea World continuously makes sure everything in the park is pretty looking. It's one of the nicest parks out there. Not only that, but the staff are super friendly and they have GREAT management. Especially with their operations. Good god these are fantastic! They do such a great job at getting their lines moving! They turn 30-40 minute waits into 15 minute waits. It's almost Disney level operations.So overall, Sea World San Diego is one of the best theme parks i've been too. It's got great staff, great rides, great food, great everything pretty much. Plus the money you spend goes to helping the park take care of more and more sea animals each year. So yeah, I highly recommend spending a full day here. You won't regret it!"
255,7/1/2019,5,Love coming here. So many things to do and I love their dine all day deal. It has changed a lot through out the years but I still enjoy coming here and learning about all the sea animals.
256,7/14/2019,5,What an amazing place.The downside was 3 of the rides were closed and after waiting in line wild Arctic was shut down. Wish they would keep rides open and on year round so those of us who travel far can enjoy the whole park. The electric show was a waste of time and where it is held is crowded with just standing and it was very short. All day dining was a great deal. The staff is friendly and the exhibits are very cool. Our family really enjoyed
257,9/8/2018,5,"I'm so happy I went there! After seeing 3.5 stars rating on Yelp I thought it won't be a great idea to go there but then I researched more and read detailed reviews, then I realised it's worth giving a try. Some tips if you're planning to go there,- don't go in car but take Uber/Lyft. Parking is very expensive and you won't get spot close to gate.- sunscreen- buy unlimited food band ($38.00)- buy ticket online from third party website, you'll save $8 handling/tax.- must watch cirque electric night show- create a schedule before you start, you need to be there at least 8-10 hours to enjoy the most parts- carry an extra shirt if you're planning to do water ride (I forgot this and had to buy extra over there which was expensive)- don't take photos, just enjoy shows! (people do this and they miss real fun)- be there in shows well ahead like 15 mins otherwise you won't get middle seat- locker service is not so expensive- don't use their dryer after ride (not really worth) instead bring towel from home and use.Hope you really enjoy. Overall, worth attending once!"
258,7/13/2019,5,We always have the best time here. My family and I have the annual pass and it's so worth it. We already know the best times to go to avoid long lines. Parking is always a breeze.
259,10/4/2018,5,"I just wanted to say a huge thank you to Gregory in admissions at San Diego SeaWorld. My family came to SeaWorld thinking we paid someone for some tickets, but we were scammed. Gregory was so kind and let us in the park free with food vouchers and free shows for the family. I have never seen such kindness shown like Gregory showed my family. Me and my family will definitely be coming back and want to mention how thankful we are for the kindness shown. You have a great employee there @seaworld.Give that guy a raise and a higher position! We need more managers like Gregory who go above and beyond.Thank youHannah Ocampo#seaworld"
260,8/28/2017,2,"For years I've heard people rave about Sea World and I have yet to see what all the hype is about. It is a huge park and you will definitely get your exercise in, but animal exhibits are few and far between. Most of your visit you will spend avoiding collisions with other visitors and passing the endless fast food and gift store offerings. There is at least a gift store on every corner which all contain similar iterations of the same product. I found nothing worthy of buying to bring home as a souvenir or to eat. There are some rides in the park, most geared at children and I was not in the mood to spend a half hour just to do a single ride. There were a few fun animal exhibits, but the price and the amount of walking to get to them really did not match up. This park is clearly geared at children, and is not very exciting for adults. The price for the visit was way out of line for the entertainment experienced, I've had better fun seeing wild life on my trips down the PCH. If you want good parking, get there at opening. You'll be in the first few rows which isn't much further than the more expensive ""premium paid"" spots."
261,8/29/2018,4,"SeaWorld is a nice little park for the kids. Â  My son enjoys the tide pools and feeding the animals. Â  Plenty of things to do and plenty of places to eat. Â  The food here is actually good but expensive. Â  Some of the places have really slow service. Â  The gift shops are priced right in the middle. Â  Make sure you use your annual pass if you have one to receive 10% off everything you buy. Â  Security was fast to get through and the employees are nice. Â  Would have rated SeaWorld 5 stars, Â but they need some improvement on the food pricing and show times. Â  Some rides were shut down to."
262,10/17/2019,2,"If you are going to both Disney and SeaWorld, go to SeaWorld first. This place will disappoint otherwise. You'd think they would have learned how to move crowds through lines by now."
263,1/13/2019,3,"Sea world was a very fun experience! Â Although we were not able to see the Dolphin show because a new baby dolphin was born and had reign over the pool that day, it was still a lot to do and see. I was surprised at all the animals you can feed and touch through-out the park without paying the huge cost of ""interactions"". Â As an adult that went to Sea World without children I have to say that it was still a lot of fun; an enjoyable experience to have."
264,12/26/2018,4,"This would have been a 5 star. But we literally left seaworld, got back by the house and sat down and ate dinner and went shopping before someone picked in the call center. One and half hour wait to give kudos to the ride supervisor at guest relations for helping my daughter.The ride supervisor was a rock star and made my daughters day. She was so excited to get on manta. But a hour and half wait on the phone? Really? Can I pay more for our anual passes and you can hire more people so I can talk to someone just a bit faster? Lol. Just sayin...."
265,8/10/2018,3,"I remember loving this place as a kid and decided to make one last trip here. The feeling definitely wasn't the same as a kid and at times I kept questioning while I even bothered coming. Park opens at 10am and closes at 10pm, but we were done by around 4pm. Plan your day around the 3-4 major shows and that should be enough. I'm a big roller coast fan, but the electric eel ride looked pretty crazy. The manta ride was much easier on the old body.For the shows, we heard some people complain about how the new orca show is different from the Shamu days, and it was. But I kind of liked it since it was more informative than just a circus show. One of the worst aspect of the park is the touching pool at the entrance. They have a tank where you can touch baby sharks. It was a busy area with only 1-2 staff watching over. We saw people picking up the shark out of the water to take pictures and kids pulling on their fins. With the right sunlight you can actually see a layer of crap (prob from the suntan lotion on our arms) on the top layer of the water. It totally reminds me of the scene in Finding Dory. I hope someone from Sea World addresses this or at least have more staff especially in this area."
266,6/20/2019,1,Thieves! Â EZ pay auto renews and continues to charge your account even after your account is paid off. Â They continue to charge you and do not renew your annual membership. Â They bank on you not calling to cancel your EZ pay. Â The rep over the phone said that they have had many complaints with this and it still not has been addressed. Â Crappy gimmicky fine print schemes to steal your money. Â DO NOT DO EZ PAY if you plan on visiting this park. Â May not seem big to them right now but Sea world just lost a customer and I'm sure many more from this crappy EZ Pay garbage.
267,9/2/2019,1,Very disappointing. Â The last time I came here was 16 years ago or so and it was still an aquarium with animal shows. They have now ruined it by turning it into some type of theme park with rides. Â Animals really aren't the focus anymore. The shows are lackluster and it's disappointing that there's no aquarium. I knew they added rides but I did not realize they took away the aquarium. Â The little tiny exhibits that are around with species does not do the sea creatures justice. Three of the larg were down and there aren't very many of those to start with and there needs to be far more shade throughout the park because it's hot and humid. Very little shade in the children's area which is unfortunate. Also we had quick queue Junior passes but there were no instructions at the rides on how to use them. We were told just stand at the exit gate and then you basically have to waive the passes at the ride operator and hope they notice you. Ridiculous. Â No lids of any kind for drinks to try to force you into buying their reusable cups. Â A total waste of $500. I would have rather stayed at Disney one more day. We won't be back... ever!
268,7/13/2019,2,"This is my 2nd time going to SeaWorld and the lines were longer than I remembered. I loved the rides including the new electric eel which is said to be the tallest ride in San Diego. The manta and journey to Atlantis are also really fun rides too. The animals were fun to look at, but they are definitely in need of some upgraded habitats. They are way too small, especially for walruses, whales, and other larger animals. Everything from tickets to restaurants are way over priced. In my opinion it's a rip off considering that you have to deal with a bunch of people that have no manors whatsoever. Overall the rides were probably my favorite part, but still costly if you want to get a fast pass to get around the giant line."
269,12/29/2018,5,"I got the annual pass, you gotta check out the penguins and also pet the bamboo sharks near the entrance, spoiler alert Â they feel like sand paper"
270,6/30/2019,5,"So much fun! My company wanted to reward are hard working employees so we took everyone to sea world. It was a blast. They were very accommodating for our large group. We had a personal guide that took us through the park. Food was good, and looking at all the various dea creatures was lovely. I highly recommend."
271,11/27/2017,3,"Im a bit torn on how to rate SeaWorld because they house whales and dolphins who clearly need thousands of miles of free sea to be in their natural state. Â That being said, I know they do a lot of animal rescue in the San Diego bay area so ... for every wrong it seems, there is a shade of good too. Â As an amusement park, I felt this was really lacking compared to the stellar and amazing San Diego Zoo. Â For the crazy price of $70, it is not worth it at all... I just happen to have my visit bundled with a Southern Cali pack and we used it. Â Seaworld was not staffed to handle the the low crowd I experienced and all the staff was mostly disinterested at best. Â The rides were basic and really does not even compare to anything at Disneyland. Â We waited for 30 minutes at times even if we were 3rd in line. Â All because the staff would talk between themselves instead of doing the safety check or unloading the ride. Â As for the animals, I did enjoy the arctic area ... mostly cause of the A/C to keep us cool from the crazy SD heat. Â We did watch the shows... they were ok but I'm not sure how I liked animals being trained as entertainment. Â Food is your basic deep fried fare with some healthier options that tasted quite bland. Â I would not choose any offering here. Â So Pros...CleanYou get to see animals you would normally never seeCons...Boring ridesNot great foodStaff doesnt care to be here ExpensiveOverall, at least I can say that SeaWorld does good for the rescue and conversation efforts. Â I applaud them for that."
272,1/6/2018,4,"SeaWorld is definitely not cheap (admission is $69.99/person if you buy your tickets online + $17 for general parking), but it was worth it to check it out once. I've never been to SeaWorld, and stopped by when I was in San Diego over Christmas weekend. It gets surprisingly crowded on Christmas Day, and I would recommend coming right when they open (and purchasing your admission and parking online beforehand). You can pay more for the up close parking, and there is a discount if you pre-purchase this online ($20 versus $25 at the gate). There isn't a need for the up close parking if you come right when they open though, since there were plenty of options. They only have 3 main animal shows (orcas, dolphins, and sea lions). I was able to see the orca show (amazing) and dolphin show (pretty good), but the sea lion show filled up quickly and they closed it off. Make sure you go in to grab a seat right away, or you could also risk not being able to get into the show! In addition to shows, SeaWorld also has a lot of different exhibits throughout the park. There are interactive areas where you can pet sharks, and actually feed seals (trays of anchovies are $5 each, buy 2 get 1 free) and bat rays (trays here are $5 each, and I think you have to buy 3 to get 1 free). You can also put your hand into the water with the nibbler fish, which really tickles! Some of the other exhibits included a penguin area (yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦, yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦, yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦), giant aquarium/tank (yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦), and another tank with walrus (yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦).It took me about 4-5 hours to walk through the entire park and watch 2 shows, and the only areas I skipped through were the kid's rides and carnival games section. I probably wouldn't pay to return to SeaWorld anytime soon, but am really glad I finally got to go. Of course, they have a ton of shops throughout the park with really cute SeaWorld themed stuffed animals, which were really soft and seemed good quality.You can easily stay the whole day here, since they also had indoor shows available at night (it was a nativity show when I went on Christmas). Food options seemed pretty decent- the fish they were grilling at the taco stand smelled amazing, and they even have BBQ available! However, you have the option to bring outside food in to save some money."
273,2/22/2018,4,"Okay, okay, it's Sea World, so you know there's a stigma about coming here. I hadn't been in close to 15 years but they offered a preschool fun pass and a teacher's pass, which got two of my kids and my husband in free for a year. My kids love sea animals and were no longer impressed with the aquarium so we gave this a shot.Parking is $20 minimum. You can pay for VIP parking ($40) but really, it's not that much closer to the entrance. Pay for the regular parking. The security line was inconsistent. There were some people taking an extra long look at bags and others who barely glanced. Note that they say no food or snacks, so if you're bringing them in, hide them well!There are self-service kiosks to the right of the security line. We printed our tickets at home so we headed straight to the entrance. The line was long but went fairly fast. They opened at 10 and we were through security and the main gate within 15 minutes.My kids loved feeding the seal lions, petting the sting rays, and seeing the orcas swim around. The highlight for them was the dolphin show! They talked about it for days. The Sesame Street play are is pretty cool but, if your kids are under 5, be prepared to help them navigate the ropes course. It was a man-to-man situation and hard to keep and eye on the kids even then. The rides were pretty simplistic and didn't last very long. Probably not worth the time, if you visit Disneyland or Knott's regularly. The food prices were between $10-20 a plate for adults. The kid's meal was around $7.50. However, the quality of food was okay. I loved that you good get an entire cup of strawberries or watermelon and apple sauce with a kids meal. Beware that the food lines at the actual restaurants (not carts) are super long and it took us 45 minutes to get lunch. Do not wait until you are starving to get in a lunch line!All in all, it was a pleasant experience and we'll go back again this year."
274,7/5/2019,5,The kids love this place. We came in the afternoon while they were doing the Sesame Street show. The music and dancing was great. Â My daughter enjoyed it. Â We will be back soon!
275,9/8/2018,2,"Went in early August. Was amazed that we had to pay $22.00 for parking. I can understand if you want the up-close parking, but for a spot pretty far away in the parking lot ? (Got there around noon). Then $89.00 per person to get in? There were three of us. No senior discount for the 80 year old with the wife and I. (We weren't planning on going on any rides). Many of the more popular exhibits like dolphins and whales you had to sign up for reserved seating. No thanks. They did a good job staging the exhibits, like sea turtles, penguins and flamingos. But extra for some exhibits/shows? No thanks. The folks that get wet in the Atlantis log flume ride get the opportunity to pay six bucks for a walk-in type clothes dryer. Seems a bit of a money grab to me. I'll stick with the zoos/aquariums in Washington State, thank you."
276,5/5/2018,4,It's sad to say that SeaWorld is not what it used to be.The shows where amazing but now the only show that is worth the wait is the dolphin show. The rides are okey . The food is actually pretty good and if you get the wristband it's worth every penny . They also have an aquarium and it's beautiful inside . Overall it's okey .probably wont be back any time soon .
277,6/23/2017,2,"Even though I swore I'd never be back.... I got free tickets and live a few mins away so I couldn't resist. Â Its kinda sad to think about how little space the animals and fish have here compared to being out in the wild but with enough beer, you can forget about that heavy stuff and enjoy watching them jump in air or slide across a stage for a few fish! I really only recommend coming here and spending some $$$ so they can continue to be fed since releasing them onto the wild at this point would kill them for sure.The best part of the night was riding the Manta. Pretty cool roller coaster!"
278,12/16/2016,4,"I had a great experience here when I visited SeaWold this past summer. Â We came on a week day and it wasn't crowded. Â You can easily spend an entire day here if planned well. Â The highlights from our visit were:-The manta, journey to Atlantis, and ship wreck rides. Note you will get soaked on the ship wreck ride.-Shamu show-Sky cable car ride over the bay known as the bayside skyride-Shark encounter-SkytowerYour visit to SeaWorld isn't complete unless you get soaked on one of the rides or at the shows. Highly recommend that you bring an extra set of clothes."
279,7/30/2018,1,You guys up your park to 10 dollars for 2 of the rides were pass holders but not going to continue next year going to knotts berry farm instead you guys shouldn't charge for rides we all ready paid $200 for the season passes omg Â really guys
280,7/19/2018,5,"""the day humans stop harming wildlife is the day sea world won't have to respond to crisis."" Or something like that. I love sea world and all of the learning opportunities available for every age. I love their rescue and release mantra. I enjoy feeding the sea lions every time I go, and watching the whales (orca and beluga) swim. The sea lion, dolphin, and orca encounters are all very educating and amazing to watch. It's incredible to see the bond between keepers and the animals. It's also fun petting the bat rays, letting little fish nibble on your hands, and finding the lesser traveled routes in the park. Never ride any of the rides, but people seem to like those a lot! What I don't love is the masses of people telling everyone how awful sea world is because they watched a propaganda-fueled documentary, filled with poor sources, regarding sea world in the past. A lot of these are usually the same people that leave trash on the beaches and have never recycled. I'm from Tennessee but I bought an annual membership so I can go as much as I want while I'm here in the summer -- you go twice and you've already saved money."
281,7/26/2018,1,"This place will soon be out of business because they seem to be out of ideas to deliver experiences. ONE show is history. ORCA is more like a documentary on whales. Watch NATGEO or Youtube for better info.Each ride, which used to be free and included in the ticket, now requires $5 per person now. Sky tower, zip line, Atlantis...etc, all require $5 each ride for just the entry. Its not even skip the line. Sea lion show was about following park map and emphasized on @ dont bring outside food and advertised inside restaurants. They have more shops/restaurants than activities and experiences. They are following the mindset of Blockbuster, BabiesRUs, etc and will soon be out of business for not making enough profits. General parking is $22, then $5 each ride per person, expensive food, makes it in the list of ""5 worst things to do in San Diego."""
282,11/14/2017,5,"If you have little kids you are bound to stop here at some point in their lives. What kid doesn't love getting wet, touching fishes, seeing dolphins, climbing structures and going on rides??!! For San Diego residents they make coming here quite affordable. They currently have a great deal on their annual passes- $99 for one year, including free parking, and TWO free guest passes! They also let you pay monthly without charging any extra fees! Yes, SeaWorld has gotten such a bad rap with the Blackfish movie but they make awesome efforts to support conservation and research. They have rescued thousands of animals and show genuine love and care for them. They have created a fun, safe, and happy environment for many children to visit and for that I am grateful we get to visit here many times a year!"
283,7/15/2019,1,"We have been coming to Sea World San Diego for almost a decade and we've always loved it, defended them through the blackfish backlash, praised their rescue efforts, been annual platinum pass holders ...in short a loyal guests and fans. However, after we spent the last 2 days going to the park, while on our vacation in San Diego, we will never again go to the park...we asked for refund on our annual passes and vowed never to go back. Â For 2 days we experienced rude, lazy employees complaining opening with one another about how much they disliked their jobs....no one knew where things were located (ie bathrooms etc.) if you asked for directions, no one knew how their platinum membership worked or possible upgrades we could do in order to actually get on a ride because the rides were 2 hours long, except for vip lines and several rides were closed down...good luck using your meal plan bracelet because there are almost 2 hour long waits for food because they didn't have half the registers open....then I tried to buy a crepe and the girl said it would be a 40 minute wait because there were 10 orders ahead of mine...instead of maybe saying things a little nicer, she sounded like she and the other girl just didn't want to work....honestly it's turned into an awful place that's over crowded, and really an unpleasant experience. Â I actually cried when we asked for a refund...a sad tradition we have to abandon."
284,7/24/2018,5,"One if our favorite vacation spots in San Diego. There is something for everyone regardless of age. They offer a variety of showes almost every hour, there is a parade, fireworks, rides for all ages. Plenty if eateries and the all you can eat option paid per person is an amazing value. We enjoy the BBQ restaurant everytime. Staff is always friendly and outgoing and parking is never an issue. Great place for families."
285,4/2/2018,4,Take my son here for his first time .. we want to spend Easter here so the line was not so long but I was wrong the line was long and a lot of water ride was close until summer time so that was a disappointment ... we buy a special pack way you can eat everywhere and $20 extra on your ticket let me tell you that is worth it.
286,10/20/2016,3,"I suppose after having gone to Disney Land, Sea World is a bit of a let-down. I, and my family enjoyed it, and had a very fun day, but it seems like one of those theme parks that once you have done it, you need never return.We rode all the big rides, and the Manta roller coaster was our favorite. The raft ride and the log flume ride both come with the warning that you ""Will get wet, YOU MAY GET SOAKED"". This is an understatement. You will-in fact-be so overly drenched and dripping, that you will no longer enjoy your day: I didn't. The shows are all fun to watch, but we particularly loved the ""Amazing Pets"" show with all the dogs, cats, birds, etc...The Arctic section of the park was super well done, but the motion theater ride was super cheesy, and I think that if we ever return to Sea World, my family and I will skip it and just enjoy the penguins and polar bears alone, and skip the ride. My take away is this: If you are visiting Southern California, you are going to go see Sea World with or without reading the Yelp reviews. Just keep your expectations a bit low, and if you really don't like to walk around dripping water all day, then STAY AWAY from the rides that warn you of being wet."
287,10/14/2018,3,Had always wanted to go here and glad we did. The place is a bit too amusement park for us and felt less like an educational experience. The tanks seem very small for some of the animals which was a bit disheartening. The staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. Â We ended up doing the all you can eat pass onto each ticket. Definitely worth it since you can not bring anything into the park. I feel like you would need two days to really see and experience everything they have. My daughter loves sea animals and this was a very memorable trip for her. Not sure that we would do it again though. Probably more educational to go to an aquarium
288,1/29/2019,1,"We had a good time with the shows and some of the rides. But, we have a a terrible incident. It starts with our mistake but making it terrible with their dishonest staff. It happens that my spouse dropped a phone and credit card in a ride. Â We were able to see the items inside an enclosed but unreachable area and we reported to lost and found. Â But they never retrieved it although they said they will walk the ground and get them later. Â We had to travel back home. Â Few days later we got an alert that someone tried to use the credit card!!! And I keep getting an automated email from Seaworld that the items are not yet found - even though we clearly told them where the phones and credit cards were. Yeah, they are with one of your dishonest employees."
289,10/22/2018,4,Overall a fun expierence. Got an electric scooter for my grandma. It was $70 for the day which was a little high for me but glad we did it. You cant bring in food which kind of stunk but they will allow you to come in and out with a stamp. Pop corn and a bottle of water will run you about $11. You can refill the pop corn for 2.50 and if you ask a cashier some will let you refill your bottle of water at the soda machine. Just make sure they know you brought your bottle in. Oh and get there early for the shows. And if you see soak zone that is exactly what it means.
290,7/7/2019,1,"I bought weekday tickets online went to the park and my daughter loved it so like any other theme park in history, I went to customer service in the park to simply upgrade to a season pass. After waiting in line for nearly an hour, I was told that they can't honor online prices in the park!?!? So I called online and was told since I already used the ticket there is nothing they can do. Even talking to a supervisor which took another 40 mins on hold didn't change that. Guess they don't want any more of my money this year - which at 12 dollars for a tiny less than personal pizza and 13 dollars for a beer is a lot of money over the season! Â Seaworld is a great experience but really needs to get with the times and their competition. Other comments: need more food and drink options. Every single place had lines upon lines which is losing them revenue. Also although the park is well maintained, towards the end of the day some of the trash cans are literally overflowing with disgusting garbage and 20 pizza boxes stacked on and around them. Perhaps they can take some of the money from the 13 dollar beer and pay someone to empty them more than once a day!!"
291,4/8/2019,5,This place was wonderful. I was expecting more aquariums though. My sons were to small to thoroughly enjoy the park. I would bring them back at 5 years of age.
292,5/31/2018,1,"Over priced admission, the few rides they have breakdown often and aren't worth the wait when they do work since everyone seems to want to only do that and the bathrooms smell worse than the animals living spaces which reek as well of course. Already didn't care for SeaWorld after reports of abuse on animals and other shady practices. Much rather go to a positive impacting nature learning space for knowledge on marine life as compared to this prison for sea life branded as a theme/amusement park. Spend your money elsewhere"
293,9/19/2018,5,This was my first time here and I had a really good experience. We stayed for about nine hours and we saw a Ton of stuff. We rode the electric eel a couple times which was amazing and we saw the sea lion show which was really hilarious and cute and we saw the dolphin show which was OK and we saw pets rule which was really good. I thought that it was gonna be more of just like an aquarium so I was happily surprised to find out it was more of an amusement park. We had a lot of fun. I know there's controversy on keeping the animals there but honestly they seemed happy and loved by the trainers. I could see not having the big whales There because it's not a lot of space for them but I didn't see any of the killer whales while I was there. I think they're still show with them but I didn't see it. Our family had a really good time there.
294,9/1/2019,1,"Wow the place has really gone down hill. Not clean, tons of trash and overfull trash bins. Don't bother with the dinning package. Waits at all the participating restaurants are over 1 hour. So sad I used to love this place."
295,8/2/2017,4,this is the one place of southern california that i have been to in years...my very last time that i was here was back in the early 1980's when i was just a kid!!! and now in the year of july 13th 2017 i am back at san diego's ca seaworld once again!!! the time that i came here was in the morning of the weekday and before the entrance were about to open!!! as soon as it opened... this is what i did when i got inside at san diego's seaworld california dolphin days show which was awesome i really liked the dolphins jumping out and jumping into the water and also doing acrobatic stunts in and out of the waters as well!!!orca encounter show which was fun to see the orca's jumping out and diving back into the water and making big splash just to get the people wet while they were seating up close!!! and for me no i did not wanna get wet so i stayed away and avoided from sitting up close from the orca's!!!sea lions live which was a entertaining show to watch the sea lions were were having fun swimming in and out of the waters and also dancing with their trainers while they were playing music of the 1940's and also one of sea lion was dancing to the music of tango which was fun to watch!!!skytower this is the one thing that i wanna go to before leaving san diego's seaworld ca the one thing that i really like most about the skytower ride is that you get to go up high and see the nice view of the seaworld locations from high above!!!i definitely would wanna go back to san diego's ca seaworld because it's such fun place to go to and while being away on vacation!!!
296,4/30/2019,5,"I never got to go to the one in Cleveland, so I was glad I got to go to this one and see all the animals you hardly ever get to see at a zoo. The shows were amazing. As expected, it was crowded, and unfortunately, seemed like a lot of areas were closed except the animal exhibits (not sure what that was all about), but it was a great experience overall!"
297,3/9/2019,2,My kids enjoyed the roller coasters....But I couldnt really explain to them the rational with having dolphins and beluga whales and sea lions do tricks for the audience. Â I think they should have informative displays and stick to roller coasters. Â Also after paying to get in they now charge for the sky ride separately. Â lame.
298,4/27/2019,5,"Seaworld is one of the best amusement parks and aquariums in the area, we love going and have annual passes. Sea world does amazing work saving sea life throughout the San Diego coast. They help any injured animals, rehabilitate and release them back to the ocean. One of the only companies that I know that does this invaluable service. Our family loves going during the weekend or even in the evenings. They have lots of rides for smaller kids and big kids. We love seeing all of the sea creatures that we would never normally see. They have a variety of restaurants to eat at and an arcade and play area as well. A wonderful place to spend the day. They also have special events, check the website."
299,1/8/2019,2,"I'm pretty bummed about how things have changed at Seaworld and how locals are treated in the off season. 22 dollars to park is outrageous! Especially when the people working fight me that I cannot use my husbands silver pass to get free parking even though I pay the bills!!! So being a teacher and getting a fun card I still have to pay the $22 even though I'm really paying for a silver card every month he just ""isn't in the car"" is their excuse not to let me use it. I call bullsh***. Also so expensive considering how many areas of the park are pretty much closed down!! Entire areas are shut down, no shops, food or attractions open. Then, 5 dollars a person to ride the tower, 5 dollars a person to ride the sky ride! This stuff used to be free. What a rip off. The only reason I gave it two stars is because my daughter loves the touch pools at the front but even then those could use some cleaning."
300,9/15/2017,2,"Visited today. For us, what a waste of time and money. For San Diego, what a waste of premium real state. Many exhibits and rides were closed. There was only one Orca show for the whole day. Cost two of us $300+ out the door, including parking and everything. Could have spent the money better elsewhere."
301,9/6/2017,5,Season pass holder !! Seaworld is awesome. Great programs for both people and the animals. We love visiting seaworld to go hang out at the Sesame Street water play area while we're enjoying our draft beer ;). The penguins are so asorbs! The new Shamu show is not that great. I have yet to see the night show at the pets rule stadium but it's always so packed to get in gotta get there hella early. The new ocean explorer realm is probably our favorite but the ride... haven't gotten a chance to get on it since they opened because the wait time is usually ridiculous or it's broken down :/ this area seems to fault often. But besides that I am always usually happy at seaworld and the kids have a great time
302,5/3/2019,5,"I have been here a couple of times, It's a wonderful place to come and not only be amazed by all the sea animals and shows, but they also have amusement rides for all ages. We always start with the Sky Tower ride, it gives you a 360-degree view of the Mission Bay area, which is perfect. But our favorite place in the park is to sit and watch the whales play in their aquarium; Â it is breathtaking to see a mammal that big next to you with only glass to separate you. Just a few tips, make sure you have comfortable shoe wear as well as clothing depending on the season. Enjoy this awesome SeaWorld!!!"
303,8/19/2017,3,"Mom: Where do you want to celebrate your 21st birthday? Vegas!?Me: Let's go to SeaWorld!Dad: ...seriously?Yup, that's a true story folks. I dragged my parents to SeaWorld for my 21st birthday because I cannot get enough of sea creatures and marine life.These three amigos rode Journey to Atlantis (and got SOAKED!), Manta (keep your head back), Skytower (long line), and Shipwreck Rapids (why so stinky?). Â We watched the live shows featuring orcas, sea lions, their ocean friends, and even rescued pets. Highlight of my trip was seeing my favorite penguins, dolphins, beluga whales, sea turtles, sharks, and flamingos. I personally appreciate SeaWorld's efforts to rescue marine animals with the ultimate goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. TIPS:- Buy your tickets online to save money. Find out if your employer, school, local market, or auto insurance (AAA does) offers discounts on admission tickets. - Save time by purchasing your parking online. General parking costs $17- Plan ahead. Visit their website to know what attractions are closed and get an idea of the map, show times, and current exhibits: seaworld.com/san-diego - Bring a light jacket or extra change of clothes if you want to go on their water rides. Stay hydrated by bringing water bottles for yourself or family. Unlike food, water bottles are allowed into SeaWorld and there are water fountains."
304,7/14/2019,2,"When you pay almost $80 a ticket a person for 5 people you'd expect concession stands to be open, stocked and ready to go when the park opens but not the case at all today. Every other soda machine had no ice and the soda was flat; this is not acceptable when people are coming to spend hundreds of dollars at your ""enternatinment park"". I hate not leaving good reviews especially because I'm a local and always have visitors in town wanting to see the local attractions but today has really deterred me from wanting to bring anyone back here. Save yourself the time and trouble and spend your money elsewhere."
305,8/31/2016,3,"It's BLACKFISH... Live!!If you've never gone, you should go. Â It's not cheap, but I think the ""normal everyday price"" is for tourists who don't know there's gotta be a groupon or a deal somewhere, on a grocery store shopping bag or a can of tuna, something. Â And it's not going to be cheap eating there either. Â And, the weather in that part of San Diego goes from burning hot in the sun to freezing in the shade, so bring a light jacket even on a hot day. Â If you HAVE gone, and it's been a while, you should go. Â I mean, it's pretty much the same thing. Â Orcas jump. Â Sea lions slide on their bellies and wave to people. Â The walrus poops in the water. Â Seagulls steal the fish and you try to feed a dolphin. Â But it might be cool to see what's changed. Â Like Medieval Times, I think it's worth going about every eight years. Â Like changing a mattress, every eight years."
306,3/1/2019,2,"So I have been going to this SeaWorld for over 30 years and have happily brought my kids here as well. I hv never had such a bad experience as I did today. First meal was good so that's god but as I got to the park I tried to go threw the handicap entrance but was denied the got into the park to find out I payed full price for less then half the park. I am use to more then one show a day so you can take your time but one show for each show, it seemed like most thinks where down. The artic exhibit only half was there and elevator was broken s I had to go up stairs. If I would have know what shape the park was in I would not have gone and waisted our money and would have came back later but now it's like I don't know if I would go again or nor would I recommend it. SeaWorld you have broke my heat."
307,4/21/2019,3,"Eh, it's ok. There wasn't a whole lot to do and we felt like half a day was way more than enough. We finished everything within a few hours and there wasn't much worth waiting in the ridiculous lines to do again. I'm sure if you paid a whole lot more for the extra interactions, it would be more fun, but no thanks to that! Everything was already soooo expensive. One positive note is that I really loved the new Orca show. It was very informative rather than just entertainment but still veryImpressive and fun. Although, I couldn't ever understand if I was supposed to be watching the movie or the pool! I'll come back, but I'll expect less."
308,6/6/2019,4,"I went to SeaWorld today and it was a great day! I came here 5 years ago, and a lot has changed (for the better)! They added new rides, changed the shows up a bit, and cleaned up the park and the workers genuinely seemed to care. Lunch was pretty good at Calypso Bay Smokehouse (which is mainly barbecue food). For a snack today, I went to Pineapple Pete's Island Eats and got a pineapple whip (totally recommend the pineapple whips for pineapple lovers)! I went to go see 2 of the shows in the park (the dolphins & the sea otters, Clyde & Seymour) Those were fun and interactive shows in which the workers seemed to have enjoyed putting on shows for the general audience. The only thing was were the PRICES of food! Boy, was the food a little overpriced for what you're getting, but what do you expect?? It's a theme park that is trying to be a little like Disneyland (especially with their merchandise), but overall it was a great day! Note: if you have small children, this is a great place to take your kids! They have the Sesame Street Bay of Play for the little ones, and a lot of stuff is geared toward the little kids. This is probably a more kid friendly theme park than Disneyland in my opinion!"
309,9/21/2018,5,"As a single mom it's hard to get the funds together and go on an outing. This was are first vacation. The flamingo lady dancer made my daughters day. Grace is on the spectrum and she just wanted to dance , your dancer brought her upfront and danced two songs with her. Â Thank you so much for the memories we will cherish them forever. Until next time...."
310,3/31/2019,1,My daughters were very excited to go on the Sky Tower. It was always free and now you have to pay $5 per person to ride it. No one is on it and you just excluded a great attraction to families who already spent so much money just to get into the park as well as hotel and travel. Now you're trying to gouge families an additional $5 per person. I could have paid the $5 but out of principle I did not. Also this will probably be my families last time here. Trying to nickel and dime families on one of the few attractions they have here is absolutely appalling. What's next you have to pay $3 for the otter show?
311,2/22/2019,1,"ZERO STARS. They claim to open at 10 but the park really opens at 10:30. In the day of our visit 5 rides were closed! The restaurants are short of staff so food takes forever. The park is not even busy (Friday), I am sure the rides are closed to save money but they are ripping the crowd off! Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT COME HERE!"
312,7/2/2018,3,"I went with my 12 yr old daughter and my 13 yr old son. Â It's was just ....OK. I felt like we were overcharged for everything. Â And don't get me wrong, I went there expecting to spend. The few shows we saw were nice. The dolphin show was by far the best! Â There was a gift shop at almost every ride / attraction. Â It's a little much. The food is overpriced and the service is below acceptable (especially for the price you pay). My daughter enjoyed the new roller coaster, Electric Eel."
313,7/22/2018,3,"I grew up in San Diego and remember Sea World when it was nice, and a really cool place to go as a kid. It's still sea world, but with a feel of big business. Things are extremely over priced for what you actually get, and the shows felt like half the dialogue was them, pushing the snack bars and cafeterias. Tanks were dirtiest tanks I think I have ever seen, green algae growing on the sides of most tanks. Not that my kids noticed, but with the amount of money they charge to get in and park your car ( 55.00 per person weekday ticket, 27.00 parking = 82.00 Â just to walk in), you think they could afford an updated filtration system. All in all we had a good experience and my daughter got to see some cool aquatic animals on her birthday. So I gave them 3 stars for mediocre everything, but amazing animals!"
314,7/6/2019,1,"Service really bad. Buy a ice cream need to wait 30 minutes? I guess they made enough money, they need to hire more people to improve their services!"
315,4/14/2019,5,"Awesome place that's a must in San Diego! Please buy tickets online or beforehand. You can save a lot of money and prevent yourself standing in a long line waiting to pay. Also grab a map before starting your journey. There are shows for dolphins and orcas that you will miss out if you aren't aware. They have lots of food, rides, and gift shops. Have fun everyone!"
316,8/25/2019,1,"Today, we have bad experiences in SeaWorld. Dolphin Staff working there was so mean. They don't let us close to the wall is ok. But after the girl said we just moved, when we are moving, she she spilled the water on us on her purpose. Also make the kids wet. Also I we feel racial discrimination. We are the first at the line, they let their same race customers go before us. They have 4 seats left, we are 2 people should be ok, but they just made us to wait next round."
317,5/15/2019,1,"I normally wouldn't give such a low rating bc I love this place. Yesterday, due to an employees disgusting and inappropriate behavior, I will no longer be patronizing Seaworld. While trying to park my stroller for the 1:30 orca show, I attempted to put it against the curb in the shade so that the buckles wouldn't get hot and burn my baby. The worker started yelling at me for trying to put it in that spot. When I asked him why he was being so rude he told me ""if you would listen better then I wouldn't have to yell at you"". I became quite upset and we started to argue and I regret getting so upset but I felt like I was being threatened so I didn't have control over my emotions at this point. I continuously asked for his supervisor or security bc it was getting out of hand. While waiting I parked my stroller in another spot farther away from him so he would leave me alone, he then came up behind me and while I'm holding my baby and said extremely low ""see even other customers agree that you need to stop bitching."" At this point I felt extremely uncomfortable and yelled at him to stop harassing us and to please go away. I said that he was creeping me out and he responded ""oh wow. You must be one of those bitches that screams and lies about rape."" He walked away and then came BACK to get in my face and get a rise out of me. Which worked extremely well and I looked like the one who was causing the problem even though I was begging to be left alone. Finally as we're in the show (no security or manager ever came.) I noticed that he stood at the entrance the entire time and just watched me, and my daughter. I honestly apologize for getting mad and loud with him but in a threatening situation what was I supposed to do? I felt so incredibly unsafe after this and found myself continuously looking over my shoulder for the rest of the day at the park. I really hope he doesn't treat other mothers like this. Had my husband been there and not deployed I doubt he would've bothered us. He saw a young mother and took an opportunity to make me feel vulnerable and afraid. Even though he got in my face multiple times, I didn't get his name. But he was a white man with a full beard and dark hair. No taller than 5'10. Wearing all black, including a hat. Beware if you're planning a trip here."
318,12/11/2018,3,My friend and I had made a reservation to interact with the dolphins. We arrived early and were confused as to where we go and what we do. We waited at the gate to be let in with everyone else. Then we had to check in off to the side and wait for this group to get checked in with us. The dolphin trainers were very nice and informative. We got to swim across a small pool with a dolphin one time...Paid over $100 for some pictures. We walked around the park and got some margaritas after waiting in the World's slowest line ever. The killer whales look so sad in the tank. I honestly wanted to free Willy! Their tails and fins were curved over and sad. I couldn't bare staring at them. The shark tanks/pools seemed awfully small for them. Actually all the tanks and spaces for all the critters were really small.. I just felt so much sadness for all of them. They all look like they're taken care of but their homes are just too small. I honestly don't think I'd ever return. This was just one of those things we'd thought we'd experience at least one time.
319,7/24/2017,3,"I have been going to this particular Sea World since 1997. This was one of my favorite theme parks as a child. I wanted my husband to experience what I had growing up, so we decided to go here last week. This place has completely changed (for better in one way but bad in another). So my favorite attraction at Sea World had been the Shamu late night show. To my disappointment, not only was there no Shamu, there wasn't a night show either. The three night time shows we went to were pretty uneventful. I understand we are in a day and age where animal cruelty is frowned upon more and more, but Sea World is just not the same as what it used to be growing up.1. Advice to SAVE some $$$: -Buy one of their souvenir cups at the start of the day to get free refills for the remainder of the day and only $1 refills for the rest of the year. -They are not too strict on bringing food in, so if you have little ones, I would suggest bringing your own snacks and possibly sandwiches to munch on. -Buy tickets online, they cost $59 vs. $99 (weekday) at the door. There is a $5 booking fee, but it is still worth buying your ticket online beforehand.-Avoid playing the games there (they are rigged!). You will be spending a lot of money and not really getting anything out of it. Save the arcade play for Dave & Busters/Chuck-e-Cheese. 2. General Advice - during the summer, it gets very hot so lots of fluids and sunscreen. I would also recommend bringing a light jacket for the night. Go early and enjoy. Great place to take the family and it won't set you back as much as other places in SoCal."
320,1/1/2019,5,Sea World is a fun place to visit. Â We raised our three boys while having season passes and they share how much fun and how much they learned during those visits. We recently took our grand daughter there and she loved the Sesame Street Parade. Â They did things right!
321,7/23/2017,2,"We were native socal who haven't been to Sea World in over last few years. Our plans for the holiday fell through so, we decided to play tourists in our old city and visit Sea World.Just so happened that tickets were discounted for $30 as we planned to visit on weekdaysWe enjoyed the day, especially getting soaked on the Atlantis ride. The only show we missed was the dolphin show because we didn't check the showtimes early enough our own fault.It was crowded as usually but, I didn't feel that we had to wait terribly long for any rides. What I DO feel was an exorbitant wait was for food at the Shipwreck Cafe!! We waited almost 2 HOURS in line all the while the other food line was CLOSED!! Obviously, Sea world thinks it's acceptable to inconvenience their customers. I felt bad for all the families with small, STARVING children waiting hours for overpriced food.Overall, we enjoyed the day in the sunshine, going on 3 rides for adults and seeing 2 animal shows, (1 was closed and we missed the other). A large portion Of Sea World is dedicated to younger children. The ""dance club"" at dark complete with DJ, black lights, glow sticks and dancing mermaids looked like a blast for kiddos.I must say, I would have come away feeling disappointed had we actually payed full price for our tickets.My recommendation for tourists on a budget; skip Sea World and go to Scripps Aquarium for the sea life and then go to Belmont Park for the thrills!Save yourself $100 per ticket and skip it!!"
322,7/11/2019,4,"We really love SeaWorld! We got a season pass this year even though we live in northern Ca. It was a great deal and I am so glad we go them. We've gone twice so far and plan to go more. We have been pretty fortunate to avoided super long lines for rides. My only complaint is the shows get so busy you have to line up an hour before they start to get a decent seat and if you wait to long they get full and you are sent away. We got a refillable popcorn and drink cup the first time we went, it has definitely saved us money."
323,8/14/2017,2,"I hate to say it but this place is going down hill. You can just tell they are desperately doing whatever they can to keep people. There are parts of the park that are run down and the production is not coordinated at all. I went to 4 shows and only 1 of them was fun (the pet show). Everything else had bad tallent, bad production and no reactions from the crowd. When it comes to production, they are flashing and trashing everything they have without coordinating it with what the talent was doing. BTW, do not go to the electric show. They just sing three words over and over and over. The Cirque show was cool too, but again, had no coordination."
324,10/8/2017,5,"I honestly don't care what anyone says about Seaworld, it's my all time favorite amusement park of all time. Love being able to see these amazing creatures up close & love the new orca show they've created - much more educational than anything. My family and I have gone three times just this summer because not only are their prices affordable, they have random promotions and upgrades. My mom purchased a 2-day pass for us through LAUSD, and on our second return, they had an option to get another day for only $10. Food is also not crazy expensive and even having dining passes available if you are looking to spend the entire day there. Can't wait until we return, because next time I'm hoping to do the beluga whale interaction!"
325,4/16/2019,5,"Wonderful educational place to visit! The kids loved the touch pools in ""Explorer's Reef"". Their pass options and shows are very accessible for people with families. Food wasn't bad either, for an amusement park!"
326,5/27/2017,3,"My wife, son and I went to Sea World today for his 7 year old birthday celebration. A friend of ours who is also a teacher mentioned that teachers get in free and can bring in 2 guests. Outstanding I thought! I went to the website, followed all of the instructions and looked forward to our trip. We arrived this morning and I was informed that I had not completed the entire process correctly and I was going to have to pay full price for 3 tickets. I was devastated. I spoke with the employee and she informed me that this has happened a LOT! If it has happened a LOT, why not try to fix it? Eventually, she told me that she could give me 50% off. I was frustrated that I had done nothing wrong yet it felt like I was being punished. Had things gone smoothly at the beginning of the day, I probably would have given today 5 stars!We saw every show today. My favorite in order were: Pets Rule, Dolphin show, Sea Lion Live and Shamu Show. We also went on Shipwreck Reef, Manta Ride and Journey to Atlantis. Overall, I would recommend Sea World, but make sure if you are expecting free tickets, to make arrangements before you get there."
327,8/4/2018,3,"For many of years my family an I have visited this place an for the 1st time I have never been more disappointed. My family planned a trip to.go during the week during summer before the kids go back to school. We bought the tickets which were a good price on line, we also purchased the all day meal pass for everyone an the parking passes. We did all of this ahead of time to save time.Pros: weather was great, didnt get bothered by any one to take a survey or to take pictures. Cons: even if u by ur tickets on line u still had to wait in line to get ur bag checked an then wait in another line to get in, a lot of the exhibits I remember being there 2 years ago were either minimal or gone, they do not have any Orca shows an all the other regular shows were over by 4, every time we used the restroom there were no soap.in the containers an they could have been kept better, every place we went to eat there were lines nothing was ready to.be grabbed, Â we even had issues with our meal passes because the person that gave them to us didn't issue it correctly, Â every concession stand we went to either wasn't working or had no ice.All in all it was an ok day but I remember it being a way better experience before.An for a park to have hours open from 10 to 10 an shows to be over by 4 was horrible. We had kids that weren't able to ride some of the rides an have the time they were very bored."
328,3/24/2019,5,Fun place and good shows! Family bonding time is great since there are things for everyone!
329,7/14/2019,4,"I was at sea world yesterday with my friends, and we had a blast. Â We got the best ticket all day dining deal(which means you can eat 3 items in one hour and it repeats for the rest of the time you are there.). We also go quick queue which makes you to skip most of the line, and we got reserved seating for shows, and finally we got a free picture. Â When we got there I was a little mad. Â For all day dining the restaurants were supposed to give out the wrist bands but they did not want to. Â I felt like they were being lazy which they were. Â So we had to go to customer service to get our wristbands. Â It was really hot so we decided to cool down on the shipwrecks rapids. Â That was a fun ride and my friends got splashes of water and I got the whole bucket. Â I was laughing because my friends barely got wet. Â We decided to go to manta after and here is a tip Â if you have a lot of stuff buy lockers because in most rides you have to leave your stuff out. Â Then we decided to use our all day dining. Â Worth it! The shows we're amazing especially the cirque eletcrique. Â We went on Sumer which we experienced electric ocean. Â I did not ride electric eel unfortunately, but my friends did. Â It was a triple launch roller coaster. Â I repeat a TRIPLE LAUNCH ROLLER COASTER. Â For all you thrill seekers ride electric eel. Â Unfortunately journey to Atlantis was closed. Â But we still had a good time. Â I would buy the annual pass. Â It will be worth it. Â Oh and in the orca encounter one specific orca was like time to wet these boys. Â Even the people that were not sitting in the splash zone got wet. Haha got em!!"
330,8/18/2018,4,Enjoyed the animals and shows. Â I don't like the move towards the theme park environment. Â I'll go to six flags for rides. Â I go to Sea World to see the animals.
331,7/30/2019,3,Don't bother to go in the summer. The food lines are long and slow unless you want to fill yourself on popcorn and churros. Â Only 3 shows worth seeing in the afternoon then you have to wait 4 hours for the next show in the meanwhile what do you do if you're not a roller coaster rider. The last and best show is at 9:30 right before they close. Take alot of patience with you.
332,5/28/2018,1,"We were at Sea World for Memorial Day weekend and it was a complete disaster. Just getting inside the park took 45 minutes with the terrible and tight entrance.Waiting in lone for passes took literally over one hour.If all of this was not bad enough there were little staff around to help anyone and every employee was overwhelmed. They had Islamic students working there as interns which is fine I guess except they could barely speak English.At one point we were sitting in the front row of the dolphin show when this woman, I'll call her ""Atilla the Hun"" since I don't know her name, swiftly stole my seat when I ran after my daughter. She moved and said I was lying, I said mam I am not lying. Luckily she didn't eat me. Â Some people in the crowd were as surly as the employees.Sea World was selling ""front of the line"" passes for another $40 per person. Avoid getting these because I wasted $160 on these for my family because they did not honor it at most attractions such as the high seeing Tower. A few employees were doing their best to make light of the terrible situation and entertaining guests.The one Star is for the failed leadership of Sea World to adequately staff their Park on Memorial Day weekend and for false advertising claiming front of the line passes actually help.I will say one positive thing the fireworks were decent. I could care less about PETA and their hypocritical attack on this park I care more about not feeling ripped off."
333,5/30/2016,4,"So I grew up here in San Diego, so I grew up being a pass member. Worked here through College, saying Aloha and swinging jewelry from the Pearl Factory. Â Now with a toddler we took advantage from the offer they had at Costco. Â $99 for a year INCLUDING PARKING. So for the first time in 16 years I've been coming to Sea World. Â Yes I saw black fish, as I mentioned I worked here so I was here when a lot of that stuff actually happened and already knew most of that stuff. Â But I also know how much the workers cared for the animals. Â That being said I love talking with trainers and asking questions, they are such a wealth of knowledge.With a kid of my own now I like the Sesame Street route they took and I like the rides. Â Most days there isn't any lines for any of the rides. Â The ropes are great for older kids, there are stairs to get up near the stairs. They have a pit for toddlers with blocks, no idea If they clean them, but I've seen them in a lot of kids mouths.So where I take away a star is parking. Â It is such a cluster and the parking spots are SO SMALL. Â Everyone is parking at the same time but you can't get out at the of you cars very easily. Food could also be Better. Â Granted their pineapple whip is awesome."
334,6/16/2018,1,"We are season pass holders. This is the giant line I stood in today to replace my pass. Meanwhile someone was smoking in the area and I had my toddler son with me. Dear Sea World... this line is ridiculous. If you're going to have people wait in giant lines, please also make sure you have no smoking signs surrounding the area. My kid likes fresh air like your mammals and fish like fresh water."
335,12/26/2017,5,"Come here all the way from north Cal every year. The kids are just love this place. We had fun too!! We kind of miss the Orca show. The new show is kind of...not as good as the last one. I know it isn't politically correct nor environmental friendly but the world it isn't perfect anyway. Just one guilty pleasure isn't too much, right? ""Black fish"" is a good documentary but the original orca show put lot of smile to lot of kids like mine. Put back the show please!!!BTW, the turkey leg is amazing!!!"
336,10/6/2017,4,"It was my first time at Seaworld and upon entering and seeing the first couple of sea animals exhibits I immediately knew that this park has seen better days. Animals looked stressed out and worn, the windows to view them with countless scratches which kind of blurred the view.The rides were great, one in particular, Manta, was a very fun roller coaster, and is pretty new. The journey to Atlantis ride was closed for maintenance which was a bummer. The river raft was very fun, and the attendant even let us go twice which was nice!The Orca show was amazing and the whales performed great!FOOD- We ate at the damaged ship cafe, dont remember the exact name but thats how it looked upon entering. I ordered a plate of fish and chips and it was satisfying, everything tastes great when you are hungry!It was on a thursday that we went and we were able to get on every ride and see every exhibit without wait which was amazing!"
337,8/18/2018,5,Everyone had blast and lots of fun at SeaWorld. Â It was Amazing to see orchas and dolphins in person and they Â perform some amazing tricks in the water for everyone. Â Tickets coast $55 per person for the day. Â Parking for car $22. Their are lots of rollover coasters rides for kids and adults. Â It as a bit hot since everything is outdoor. Â Not a lot of shade even at the performance theaters. Â I would like to see SeaWorld invest in some shades in the park special for summer. Â It is a great getaway for friends and family to enjoy. Â Highly recommend for everyone to go at least one in their life.
338,3/31/2019,3,It was fun many years ago. Now the shows are not as good as before. Sky Tower not free anymore.
339,7/23/2016,4,In Southern California so had to stop at Seaworld especially since the whales will be rightfully released next year. Really enjoyed ourself especially the roller coasters; please don't underestimate the Seaworld roller coasters :)We did have the opportunity to see the whales perform and get completely splashed; the show was cut short when the trainers realized the whales didn't want to perform any longer. I've been to the San Antonio and Florida Seaworld and this is my favorite.
340,8/28/2018,5,"Wow My son and I had such an amazing 3 days at Sea World we had so much fun we bought season passes! The were well worth it! Â My son is 12 and he said this is by far the best, better than Knotts Universal Studios Disneyland and LEGO Land! Â Although I must say he is very fond of Sea animals but we had an amazing time! Â And the staff has been so nice and helpful! Special shout out to Ryan Cascante for going way above and beyond making sure we got to the last show and for Marie in medic helping us get to the gate after a very late my 3 days and a shout to everyone else who was very nice! Â Not one thing to complain on!"
341,7/15/2018,1,"Honestly, I liked going to SeaWorld with my girlfriend a lot. We loved walking around and watching fun little shows and riding things but seriously don't do it. And PLEASE for the LOVE OF GOD do NOT sign up for EZPay. They're customer service in this department is simply horrific. I've been on hold for hours multiple times with no avail in getting them to actually cancel my subscription.They don't tell you how to cancel the EZPay contract anywhere and they automatically renew. I absolutely realize that this is in there terms and conditions but really guys? Are you so desperate for my $20 a month that you make it this hard?PLEASE, save the fishies and go to Legoland instead."
342,9/13/2019,4,"I am a San Diego Native and have been going to Sea World most of my life. But I am just a little disappointed with what they have. Also, not really a fan of all the Alcohol that is sold there, I don't mind it, but I also like the fact they kept in one location like the beer garden. But that is just me. Not many things to look at."
343,4/25/2017,1,"Read this before you spend a fortune on tickets to go to Sea World. I gave up on Sea World after watching ""Black Fish"" on Netflix. It is just too much to watch the fishes get tortured. However, in the back of my mind I still hope they are making an effort to fix their mistakes and make things better. My 4 year old niece came to visit me from another state and insisted to go to Sea World. I was very hesitatant about it but decided to go eventually. It was last Monday (April 24, 2017). I spent almost $300 for four tickets (my 4 year old niece has to pay for ticket too since she's above 3 and they don't have children ticket--- I know right !!!!).We all went to see the orca show, one of the killer whales had a bent fin just like in the documentary. They definitely weren't in a good mood. No any trainers got into the water as well. None trainersof the trainers went in the water. They proceeded to explajn that the bent fin had to do with their bone structure, which was all BS. Well, very low move Sea World !!!! I moved to the next exhibit with the white pilot whale. My niece was pointing us to the whale and said oh look at them kissing and playing. Suddenly I realized they weren't playing. 3 whales were trying to attack the other one. He got bit and bled badly in the tank. (I got everything on video). I noticed he had tons of scratches on his back and tail, so they probably fought all the time before. I guess the tank was so small for all of them for whatever the reason was, they don't belong there. It was so heartbreaking. My niece was terrified. Plus, a majority of the stores were closed. The sky ride was closed. The whole place was so empty and depressing. I felt like I got ripped off and wasted my hardworking money on this place. So think twice before you make the decision to take your family here.I don't know what to say anymore but SHAME ON YOU SEA WORLD. I AM DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK AND I HOPE YOU WILL BE CLOSED SOON !!!!"
344,12/25/2017,4,"There are few places in the world where you can see orca this close, and learn about all types of species that surround water. Â From the whales, to penguins, to dolphins, to rays, to walrus, and thousands of fish. Â SeaWorld has them. Â Despite their negative press over the last few years, I see the people there, the actual people who work there only wanting to do good. Â The conservation, the rescue, the education. Â I am lucky to have the opportunity to visit. Â If the amazement of the animals isn't enough for you, there is the rollercoaster. ;)"
345,2/22/2019,5,"Worth the (high) price of admission, as you can spend all day there. We mapped out our day around the dolphin, whale, and sea lion shows. Feeding the rays, the entrance touch tanks, the funicular ride over the bay, and the shark encounter were all additional highlights. Can also bring in your own food and drink, which can save some money. Have to pay for parking as well."
346,12/1/2016,5,I've had a Season pass for many years now. We must go here at least 6 times a year. We spent last Sunday here just in time for the Christmas Â displays and shows. The decoration throughout the park is beginning to look dated and faded. It's time to seriously add new shows to their lineup. My pass doesn't expire for one more year and I just can't see going back unless there are new attractions. Please make buying a 2 year season pass worth our while or refund our money. Thanks that's all.
347,7/4/2017,5,"I don't care what anyone says about seaworld- they have my support! Seaworld does so much for injured animals in our community.Â  I have a great time everytime I visit the park. Pets rule and the sea lions live show are my favorite shows! All of the pets in pets rule are shelter animals and I love the message at the end of that show. Biff is awesome at the beginning of the sea lion shows. For all you seaworld haters...Â  how they got orcas in the 1st place i agree wasn't right. But seaworld cannot release the orcas back into the ocean. They will not survive!Â  Seaworld isn't allowed to breed anymore and have to stop shamu shows. Its educational based or will be. (I haven't been to the park since ruling went into effect) So peta already won that battle.Â  Seaworld has done more good than bad for sealife! Anyway, my favorite exhibit is the sea lions. (Can you tell I love sea lions?). Watch out for those birds! They will take your fish when you try to feed the sea lions. They are so funny to watch! Wear lots of sunblock and if I remember right, you can bring outside food but not fast food. Like snacks and waters and such."
348,6/26/2018,5,Sea Otter Show and the Electric Eel ride Amazing! Highly suggest you check both of these out at San Diego Sea World.
349,7/30/2018,3,"It's still an okay place. The Whale Show isn't as good, no offense but there's too much talking and fluff during the show. There used to be more action and stunts. It's more of an educational piece now. More of a connection was made before, like that kid that carves the necklace..those diehard fans know what I'm talking about! People in the crowd were yawning, that's not a good sign. But the cotton candy was amazing during the show lol. The Dolphin Experience was nice. Had to pay a little extra to have that close encounter and it was well worth it! You get to command a dolphin to do things while feeding it. Our trainer was super nice too. He made our trip well worth it. Some of the food stands were closed because it was during the week, but COME ON! People are hungry and want the full experience when you're paying full price. We paid extra for close parking, but when you go early during the week, it's really unnecessary. The parking guy was wearing a Power Rangers communicator watch so +1 to them lol. TIP: Wear sunscreen because you'll be there for hours! Purchased some pictures that were taken during the Dolphin Experience and they turned out nice. Great for memories! It's 2018 SeaWorld, spice things up!!!!!"

351,9/2/2018,5,"Family friendly!! One thing happened to me that made me tell myself I have to 5 star them. They have breastfeeding stations which is a closed room that is air conditioned and with a rocking chair, it made my day so much more comfortable cause my baby tries to uncover me while feeding lol. We had so much fun in the exhibits and watching the shows it was easy to bring a 4 month old and still have fun. Suggestion if bringing a baby is besides stroller bring a baby carrier and unbrella. Wish I would have but that's my problem."
352,6/22/2019,1,"Having not been here for awhile almost 30 years I so wanted it to be a GREAT Â experience and fun and unfortunately neither were true so I have to rate this trip as not living up to expectations. Â Oh there were some good moments but mostly Â just indifference Â from Â park employees (when you could find them) Â more on this later. Â Our day began with a drive from the OC to SAN DIEGO via the parking lot(otherwise known as the southbound San Diego fwy) Â that took approximately 2 hours and THEN SOMETHING I ABSOLUTELY can not speak highly enough about Â DO YES PLEASE BUY AHEAD of time THE UP CLOSE PARKING 32 on a recent saturday(unless u are handicap stickers get to park up close). Â THE good at the park is the shows Â all are fantastic Â just wish they were a little longer and the exhibits are really good as we even saw them feeding penguins Â  Here are some tips hope they help Â IF u need to rent a locker do it at the front of the park where it is 15/per day Â otherwise near the rides it is $2 per hour. Â  Some people think the 39 fee for all day dining is a good deal Â and all I have to say us REALLY!!!!!!! Â  because it is absolutely the worst option to choose Â as the food is so bland Â throughout the park Â (It is also very expensive) Â w/o all day dining. Â If you have kids Â plan om spending a lot of time in the kids play area Â very well thought out. Â HOWEVER ONE IF THE WORST THINGS AT THE PARK IS THEIR SESAME STREET THEMED PARADE Â It is dreadful and a complete waste of time. Â The actor playing BIFF at the SEA LION show IS CERTAINLY MORE ENTERTAINING Â in fact biff and the sea lions and other were AWESOME!! Â  Another problem is the park needs more directional signage so u know where the shows are and the rides. Â Unfortunately Â SEA WORLD realizes it has a very captive audience and attempts to hodge Â the public with exorbitant food prices for really bad food and another IF U CHARGE TO DINE with ORCAS Â make it better than a buffet Â so the food doesn't look so tired. Â They have more souvenir areas and food concession stands than anything else Â They do not have enough employees in the queue area of the most popular rides. Â  Â  Â summing up the day Â I would do it in this order Â Orca Â show, sea lion show then a ride of your choice (shortest line) then the dolphin Â show Â fit in the other rides u missed then visit penguins shark etc etc Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  IN A WORD Â GET THE UP CLOSE PARKING Â stay away from the food and have fun. Â  I would bring my own food and pit in an all day lockers Â then visit in order suggested"
353,7/5/2018,5,"Went here yesterday for the 4th of July. Long story short, I was very impressed with Sea World!I had only been here once before when I was a kid (maybe 15 years or so). I got there right after park's opening since I live a bit away and didn't plan on going back anytime soon. I was unable to do everything that I had wanted/planned. The main thing to see in my opinion are the shows. There is a reserved seating option for most of them where you can get seating in advance. This ended up not really being worth it until the afternoon, and then I would definitely recommend using it for any night shows. The night shows fill up, for most others you can show up about 30-60 mins early and get a really good seat that way. I got the food wristband and I would recommend that if you are going to be at the park all day. The food is pretty good and if you eat more than one actual meal, it is definitely worth it! The fireworks were amazing! Just as good of a show as Disney or other theme parks. I was very impressed with the staff! Everyone that I talked to seemed to really like their jobs and seemed very friendly. Another thing I liked about the park was that it had a much more chill vibe than Disney or other parks, where I feel like you are constantly being watched.All in all, I think that this was a good value. Get your tickets online for much better pricing, and if you are a vet I think you can get in free on certain days. After seeing all of the optional things you could do here,I will definitely be coming back sometime soon!"
354,5/28/2018,2,"We were relatively disappointed with our experience here. When pre-purchasing tickets, there was very little information about the event we wanted to attend so I had to keep emailing them. We were going for the dinner with Sesame Street characters, but there was no info on how long the parade was (they seemed to overlap each other) and other details that are helpful when you're planning a long day out with a toddler.I pre-purchased the up-front parking a few days before and when we arrived we were told that they were full. Â Why say that quantities are limited if you just keep selling anyway?When we got into the park the signage was inadequate and it just felt old and dingy. Â We showed up in time for the Sesame Street parade. Â When I asked a gentleman in the parade area where we should sit he pointed out a few spots. Â The spot we ended up choosing was at the end of the route, so there wasn't much of a show. Â I wish he had told us where the ended and where the better seating was for a better experience.Finally it was time for dinner with the characters (our kiddo was PUMPED!) Â There was no signage for check in and the system was terrible. Â Not sure if they were short-staffed or not, but it was pretty poor. Â The meal was terrible, but honestly, I expected that. Luckily we got our photos with Elmo but quite a few kids didn't because once again, he was hidden behind things and there was no signage. We also pre-paid for a photo and I had to speak to 4 people before anyone could send me to the right place.For the amount paid and a well-known brand, I expected more. Â Seems like management isn't sure what they want to be - an amusement park or an animal park. Â It takes strong leadership to create the kind of experience that makes a family want to come back for more. Â At the very least some additional well-trained staff and additional communications strategy to man age guests' expectations would go a long way."
355,6/18/2017,4,Seaworld has some good rides for all ages. The water ride and manta are my favorite. This place also has some decent shows featuring Dolphin and sea lions and orca( whale). My personal favorite is the Dolphin one. Its funny snd informative and has some wow moments. The sea lion show is also good. Orca is more informative and has nothing special about it. The food inside is not so great and is on the expensive side. Overall a decent experience. Do go on Thursday as it is least crowded day and you can cover the whole park with shows in 4-5 hours.
356,4/8/2016,5,Touch tanks were a lot of fun for the kids.They even have rides now!!!It's been awhile since I've been here..got invited through MOMS club for an educational experience. We enjoyed the shows. Customer service was great. We got approach a couple times... if we needed help with directions.My husband did get a headache after lunch... the first aid place was able to give him some motrin.I've seen BlackFish. The Shamu show was pretty mellow compared to before. I value having my kids see appreciate nature. I'm glad they will not be breeding them anymore. I will continue to come here because overall my family had a blast!
357,7/21/2019,1,"I took my family that came from Mexico today. I'm a member and go almost every other weekend. Â I don't know what happened today but it was crazy full, felt like I was in Disneyland. Â It was the worst experience ever, no drinks or Ice Â available in the machines. Â Most of the rides were close and stood in line for an 1 hour in the soaking raft ride and never got ti ride it. Also to go into SeaWorld they only had 1 cashier going back and forth , while the line was all the way to fiesta island. Â All I wanted is for my family to have fun!"
358,7/9/2019,1,I wish I could give this zero stars. Â Went with some family friends and all the animals seemed off. Â Shortly after I learned of all of the animal maltreatment and I understood why.
359,8/4/2017,5,"We visited on a Thursday and it was not busy at all. We finished everything in a day. If we didn't have a senior citizen in our group, it might have been finished in less than a day!The Killer What ""show"" is still around. According to the trainers in the show, the show will be replaced by an ""encounter"" instead. The ""stadium"" it was in was small and you could tell the area is under construction.The dolphins show was awesome! Though I kept imagining the dolphins rising up and slaughtering humans a la Simpsons."
360,6/20/2018,5,"Well, last night we went back to check out the Electric Ocean show. We were a little reluctant to do so since it seemed that the showtimes were a little late. Nothing Seaworld can do about that since it just keeps getting dark later and later.We arrived at the park somewhere around 2000. Oh! And since we are pass holders, we received a free Seaworld pin! Anyway, we accessed the park and did our normal walk. People were starting to come in, and the place was starting to get crowded. We starting making our way towards the ILLUMINIGHT show, which started at 2045. That show was OFF THE HOOK! tons of lights, amazing acrobatics, really good dancing, very professional crew of performers... and the laser show going along with the dancing, the moves, and the bright colors, made for a very exciting and innovative show. It lasted about 20 minutes, just the perfect amount of time, specially for the kids.Then, the show was over with just enough time for us to walk to the other side of the park, so we could enjoy the CIRQUE ELECTRIQUE show... WOW! It was like watching the X-games on acid! What's up with that guy doing a back- to back- to back- to back- to back- to back- to back- to back backflip on a ski-doo? Or the guy with the water hooverbord doing all kinda of crazy stuff??? Climbers, trapeze,, divers, jumpers, that show had it all! We will be back soon to enjoy the rest of the Â performances. There is just not enough timeTo do all of the shows in one night...check out my videos of the events."
361,3/20/2018,3,"I have super mixed feelings on Sea World, if I hadn't gotten free tickets I wouldn't have gone but since I did I gave it a go. Â I honestly do not think this place will be around in ten years and I guess that might be a good thing, but at the same time I think they are trying to do some good but maybe it doesn't matter at this point. Â I tried to use this as more of an aquarium and if that's what you want you will be disappointed. Since the circuses have mostly closed down and the ones that are left have dropped most of the animal attractions Sea World is left as sort of a last holdout of that sort of era. Â Sure they have some tanks with fish and turtles but its very lacking in information so you feel that everyone is just there for a quick look and a splash of color not a thought about where they come from and should they be in the same tank. Â You will not leave here with a deeper understanding of the aquatic world.The shows...only saw one, did not like it. Â They throw in some ""Recycling keeps the sea clean for our friends"" but you have a rope around a dolphins mouth so you can pretend to water ski? Â It's just sort of sad. Â They really try to play up the Sea World is saving animals around the world spiel...but I'm not buying it. Â It's sort of a weird mix. Â I wouldn't come back, but I see why people go. Â I guess that's what sums it up, go soon because it will be gone before long, and that's probably a mixed message just like Sea World itself is."
362,9/3/2018,5,Everything exceeded my expectations. Money well spent. Great event for family. The orca show was the best part.
363,5/31/2017,1,"Just visited SeaWorld with my family for the very first time, almost a week ago and was VERY DISAPPOINTED with our experience. We were traveling with people in our group using ECVs and had the most difficult time getting on rides and working with the ride staff. No one seemed to know what they were doing and on one ride we ended needing to call a manager because we were treated so rudely by the staff. I spoke with a manager who apologized for that employee but offered no type of compensation for our troubles. We spent so much money traveling from Hawaii to get there only to be discriminated against and treated badly because our disability was considered ""only an injury."" Told to me by the supposed supervisor of their ride. My family and I didn't feel that the visit was worth the lines we spent to get there and definitely wouldn't go back again. Not to mention... we didn't even get to watch a dolphin or orca show because we were just trying to salvage what was left of our day after such atrocious service and treatment. I would NOT recommend this place... it was as I said, a major disappointment."
364,6/13/2019,1,"@seaworld i traveled all the way over here from the bay area for there to be a major delay. the young gentleman gave us a terrible attitude, used profanity to my family and mentioned #seaworldsandiego will not be open until late afternoon!!!! i'm with a party of 15 right now and this is ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!! @seaworld you mean to tell me you guys didn't know about this earlier?! i've already called my attorney and plan on pursuing legal action. this is beyond me. terrible experience. #seaworldsandiego is not what it used to be!!!!!!!!!! i have recorded footage of all this madness smh"
365,6/3/2017,5,Seaworld is head and shoulders a better place to take young kids because of all of the different close interactions with the animals and the rides that they can go on. There is a large kids playground area that is unbeatable and I still believe that it is better than the zoo or the wild animal Park
366,7/24/2018,5,"A visit to San Diego is not complete without going to SeaWorld. It's great theme park good for everyone-young and old. You get to learn a lot, and I mean a LOT of stuff. Very educational. Awesome shows as well. Dolphin and sea lion shows were awesome. Staff all over the park are very friendly and helpful. Worth the money. They also offer free admission for military people and three dependents. Great perks. Love it here"
367,7/27/2018,3,"Pros: Killer Whale show, Big sea animal displays (Beluga whale, sea lions, walrus, dolphins, turtles, sharks)Cons: Very Expensive! Crowded! We took my kids to this place to see the sea animals. It is not the highest quality aquarium and the large crowds make it difficult to just sit back and enjoy watching the fish. Many of the windows needed to be wiped down. The tide pools for starfish didn't have any starfish to touch because there was a massive extinction event?? The shows we went to were so packed people sat in the aisles and stood in the fire escapes! There are also better theme parks with rides out there. There is a lot of walking to see each aquarium. I can't quite put my finger on why this place just comes off as trying to squeeze every nickel and dime from you, it just does. Pay extra to feed animals, pay extra to touch animals, go through gift shop at end of each exhibit. It was awesome to show Killer whales, Beluga whales, and a walrus to my kids, but after parking, tickets, and lunch this place cost 400.00 and we left early. We won't come back probably again."
368,12/30/2018,3,"I really wanted to give Seaworld the benefit of doubt, but make no mistake, this place is a marine animal circus and amusement park at its core. Animal exhibits are far and few in between, and typically linked to the arenas where the shows take place. Park employees stationed sporadically throughout the park half heartedly recite animal facts into microphones, while advertising other for-fee park attractions. This place was originally conceived by entrepreneurs as an novel form of entertainment for the masses, and it shows.I went in December, when two Christmas animal shows are offered: O Wondrous Night (the Nativity story ""as told from the perspective of the animals), and the Clyde and Seamore Christmas Special, which comprises the same tricks from the regular Sea Lions Live show, just with more tinsel and Santa hats. Sadly, the pre-show one-man vaudeville act that warms up the crowd at the sea lion show is more entertaining than the show itself. The orca show has been revamped since Blackfish to be outwardly educational, with a ""natural"" above water backdrop of evergreens (not that the orcas really care), but largely features the same crowd-pleasing tricks as the dolphin show (lots of splashing, jumping, etc), except that the trainers stay out of the water.Unfortunately, the highly recommended Cirque Electric show is only offered during the summer months.Parking is a steep $22 per car for regular parking, admission is $72 per adult. If you want to actually learn something, save your money for an actual aquarium with informed employees. If you're looking for a marine themed circus, this place barely delivers. If you must go, go once and that's more than enough."
369,6/26/2018,1,"DO NOT buy reserved VIP parking. Its pretty much a scam. Â Seaworld defines ""reservations"" as first come, first served. I tried to get a refund but was refused. I couldn't even enjoy my stay there, because it felt like I was robbed. Their reason for not giving me my refund or even the difference of general admission was, you were there in the parking lot, so you cannot receive anything.Don't spend the $50 all in one place Seaworld.Order# 20180623522618Voucher# 4900 35416 29220 5411"
370,7/5/2018,4,"This place is definitely fun! Great for young kids and people who like marine life. As this park has animals, it also has rides! There are only a tiny bit of them, but these rides give you thrill, excitement, and fun! Manta is full of twists and turns, which is thrilling, but also fun for the whole family! The newest ride is the electric eel, which is very fun, but can be a little too rough for little kids. Even though the area of the ride is very small, the ride itself is very extreme and has proved that you dont need a lot of space to make a ride fun! Finally, Â the food here is delicious! There are funnel cakes, barbecues, and much more! Â I would reccomend this adventurous park to anyone who likes a little fun! Â Even though the price is a little high for all the extra things, this place is definitely worth it!"
371,4/9/2017,4,"My girl and I had a great time when we visited on a perfect weather Friday. We saw a few shows, enjoyed average food that we waited on a long line for and we were happy with the staff and pricing. The orca and sea lion shows were very entertaining! Pricing during the weekdays are pretty solid."
372,5/20/2017,4,"Nice place to see the aquatic breed like dolphins,whales and lot of other things.The best part is the dolphin,whale and sea lion shows.It is really amazing how people could train these animals and make them do amazing stuff but at the same time feels like we are holding them in a artificial habitat and entertaining ourselves which is a bad thing for them. Nice place to visit and especially kids would love it."
373,8/9/2017,4,"This was our first visit since 1987 when we took our kids, age 7 & 11. This trip was with our now 36 year old daughter and husband and their two kids, age 7 & 11. Much has changed in thirty years. They still offer some of the best, entertaining shows with animals. The show with seals was particularly entertaining again. The biggest change was in the Orca show. The trainers no longer enter the water and perform WITH the whales. They direct from outside the pool or on various platforms. And the focus is geared more toward education rather than a pure entertainment format. Still, it was great fun. And yes, we got soaked, sitting in the third row. Another big change was the addition of amusement rides. They aren't nearly as proficient at moving through big crowds as Disney, but it was still OK. Two rides in particular were really fun in my opinion: Journey to Atlantis, a water-type ride with wet and wild drops and The Flying Manta Ray, a fast coaster-type ride with speedy twists, turns and drops. An area that they excel in over Disney, in my opinion, is in their food. For $36.99 you can eat an entree, a side/dessert and a drink at one of five different restaurants. ONE TIME EACH HOUR OF THE DAY!!! For kids the price is $18.99! So you can stop in and get a dessert and a drink one hour and then go back an hour later and get something entirely different. I saw some common items at each restaurant - namely rotisserie chicken, burgers, fruit cups and a few different cakes like carrot cake, chocolate cake, etc. Quality wasn't spectacular but at least it was affordable. We enjoyed our day and wouldn't mind visiting again."
374,7/20/2019,1,"OMG. Figure out your parking! Why does it take so long to take money??? It's every time we come, no matter what time. It take FOREVER to get into the parking lot."
375,8/11/2017,2,"Sea world is overrated price and food wise. Only reason we go is when we get free tickets and plus we still have a younger daughter and she likes it. But other than that I would never pay for this park.They've had the same shows, so boring. Â They have lockers get this lockers to lock up your belonging so you can go on the ride $1.00 an hour. Are they serious, as if this place is not expensive enough, anything to make a buck.I would only return with free tickets, sure I guess I'd recommended to families with little kids, but again definitely not worth the price you pay for everything"
376,7/4/2017,3,"First time I've been to SeaWorld was back in 2010 when my husband and I was just dating. Â Now with kids, we wanted them to experience something different besides typical theme park like DLand. Â We bought 3 All Inclusive Dining tickets since we're there the whole day. Â Guest Relation: Â long line and can not keep a flow rate. Â Waited in line over an hour and this is when I came right when park opened. Â The girl that helped us took forever. Â We bought 3 adults bundle tickets and she gave my daughter the kids bracelet although we pointed out we've paid adult price. Â Her response? ""Oh it's just a colored bracelet. Â It won't matter."" Ok so took her words and guess what? After eating at One of the restaurant we had troubled with my daughter's order. Â So we had to go back to guest services again. The bundle all inclusive includes:Front of line cutting: waste of money because most of the rides there are not participant in this. Souvenir photoSecond day freeReserved seating: waste of money All dining: 4 or 5 participating restaurants and omg, the line is ridiculously long. Â No wonder they say every hour because basically you'll be in like until next hour comes. Â Park: Â we went to a few shows. Â Dolphins was a good one. Â But they've changed out Shamu."
377,7/4/2018,4,"This is where sea world started. If you have been to another such as Orlando or San Antonio, it is not the same as the Pacific Ocean backdrop of San Diego. This is an amazing masterpiece of entertainment and scenery. The only downside is your patience waiting for shows with great anticipation."
378,5/24/2018,4,"I have such mixed emotions about SeaWorld and it's hard to give them 4 stars when I truly feel they deserve 3. However, with consideration of how they're positively trying to change their image (after all of the controversy they've endured) I will give them the benefit of the doubt.I am not a fan of the orca show and it's sickening to see these beautiful animals with damaged dorsal fins performing tricks on command for an audience. Rumor is this is the last year they will have any orca shows and I pray it to be true. I have no desire to watch that bs, it hurts my heart.Apart from that, SeaWorld is extremely educational for both children and adults. They do have many exhibits that provide in-depth knowledge of various marine and wildlife, which I believe is essential to create an understanding and respect towards all creatures whom we share this planet with."
379,3/30/2018,5,We had a good day today at SeaWorld. This was my first visit to the park in over 20 years and it has changed a lot. I did not have any set expectations and after today I felt that it was pretty good. The unlimited dining option was a great value with a discount that we got through my wife's company. The rides and attractions were all well-maintained and entertaining. Overall a good time for the family.
380,2/16/2019,5,It is an awesome place for adults and kids. The season passes have cheap monthly payment plans.
381,8/19/2019,1,"Just called seaworld to inquire about prices for transport within the park as my daughter bought me an annual pass. We went for first time Saturday and I find the distances are too far for me to walk as I am 84 with breathing problems. and electric chair with out canopy is 59.26 Â aday!!!!! Â a regular chair is Â $15 but my daughter is 62 and has hip and arm issues Â so she cannot push me .. Prices are ridiculous!!! Â I came to Sea world when we first moved here in 77 and I believe it was 4.75 Â  a ticket and Â all the Â shows , etc were free. Â What a ripoff!"
382,11/27/2017,5,Always a great time at SeaWorld. I would suggest getting the all you can eat deal for an extra $20 on top of your ticket. You can eat every hour at the selected restaurants.Alsoooooo... my boyfriend proposed in front of a Beluga whale!!!
383,2/16/2016,4,"A nice low key place for a day out with the family. Â It's doesn't have the pains of the larger theme parks. Â Navigating the park and parking was pretty easy even on a holiday weekend. Â Food and beverage lines were never more than a few minutes. Â The main attractions are the Killer whale show, Doplhin show, Sea Lion/otter show, Pet show, water ride, gondola, giant elevator on a tower, 2 roller coasters, and a fun playground for kids. Â Take the entertainment at face value and don't ponder the deeper issues of animal cruelty. Â There are messages in each show that heavily spin Seaworld's philanthropic and conservation efforts. Â At $90 it's a little steep but you can easily find discounts. Â Try Costco too. I got my tickets through work for about $63 a piece."
384,8/3/2017,4,"Was here last weekend for the first time using their free passes for US Military Veterans. Â It was a smaller park than I expected, but very clean, the staff we encountered were all very nice, and even though the Manta ride is for teeny tiny adults and no one above a size large, it was still a good time. Â Loved the shows (even the Orca show that is phasing out) and loved the up close (and free!) encounter I was lucky enough to have with the dolphin I got to feed. Â It's nice that this park focuses more on the animals and less on rides than a similar park up (Looking at you Marine World) now does. Â  There were no monster lines for a Saturday, and that definitely added to the whole experience. We took advantage of the AYCE wristband, and it was a great money saver, despite the limited choices to allows. Â It was a great one time experience, and while I'd go back one day, probably not for a while. Â That was actually the only place we encountered lines, was at the eateries, and truthfully, they should have some sort of express lane for those of us who paid for the perk. Â Also, they decided that all forms of ice cream are excluded from the package, and well, that's just mean. Â At $36/adult, it's still cheaper than anything else, especially if you spend all day there. So, if you have the chance, go. Â Check it out. Â The animals seem to be happy and well cared for and I don't think they entirely deserve the reputation that documentary gave them. Â At least not the San Diego one."
385,9/4/2017,5,So far this place has impressed me. They offer a free entrance to all Military/Veterans Love what hey have done with the place and love seeing the animals.
386,6/18/2017,5,"Wow!!! Â This was our first ever trip to seaworld! Our favorite part was definitely the new cirque electrique show! Seriously mind blown!! We saw every show they had to offer! Favorites in order dolphin show, orca show, pets rule and sea lion show! We also saw the new illumi night show! Plan ahead look online before you go and plan which shows to attend! We also got in a few rides. Â Best. Day. Ever. Â I almost forgot the dining with the orcas upgrade is a must!!! Â So neat!"
387,8/8/2019,3,"I have been attending seaworld since I was 4 and it been 13 years now. I love this place. They have much to offer; however, I am larger in the hips and slightly the tummy. Because of this the rides here are small for me. So they are not plus size friendly on a large portion of rides. I feel it is not very inclusive as it could be. This not a hate comment and not a complaint but more of an urge and topic that I hope the owners of seaworld can discuss being more inclusive in sizes."
388,2/4/2018,3,"This is a hard one for me to rate because I'm a huge animal lover. It sometimes goes against my idea of certain animals being able to be free. There definitely are things I do like and dislike about this place, but I will be neutral and give it a 3 stars. You learn and get to see lots of beautiful animals that are aquatic and a few land animals. The tanks, facility and interactive areas are all very clean and it's definitely well taken of. They seem to be big on keeping the environment and sustaining the wildlife so that's a big plus for me. You can find a few thrill seeking rides like rollercoasters, and lots of play area and rides for kids. For certain animals, you can see them on certain hours for a show (like dolphin, sea lions, and orcas). My least favorite part was the petting area, not because I don't like the animals, it's just invasive and people dunking their filthy oily hands into the water and kids grabbing them did not make me happy at all. But that's just my personal view of it. Make sure to get here early since they do close early in the evening. They have options to be an annual pass holder where you get free parking and a discount on goods when you return."
389,12/11/2015,4,"I love coming to Sea World. When I was a kid, I used to come here all the time with my cousins. Not so much anymore. It has gotten expensive. You literally pay for parking, tickets and food. That can cost a lot of money especially the food. I like coming here during the months when it is not too hot or too cold. I won free passes to Sea World for December 11 from 5 pm to 10 pm from a radio station. 103.7 was the radio station I won passes from when we were at December nights at Balboa Park. Sea World's look has improved over the years. More rides and activities for kids and adults. So many exhibits to see wild life at its best. My favorite would be the Shamu Believe show, the Dolphins and the shark exhibit. I had so much fun walking through Sea World. They had so many lights all around the park to celebrate Christmas. So festive! If you haven't been here before, you must visit at least once. It can be expensive but worth the trip."
390,9/6/2016,4,"We have visited SeaWorld over the years especially when our kiddos were toddlers. However, our recent trip as a family we experienced a more modern park with new changes that left us impressed & delighted!Labor Day was not as crowded as expected, the staff was very friendly, and the wait times for the rides & various shows were not long and a breeze. We LOVED the charge/rest areas, especially when we needed to recharge our iPhones & their $6 drying machines come in handy after getting soaked from the wet rides. Great idea & what a great addition to the park, very thoughtful for guests to utilize. Veterans & 3 family members get in free. You can also scan your tickets via your phone. The $17 parking, food, & snacks were affordable with self serving options. It was so refreshing to say the least to see this park so accommodating making our day very enjoyable!!With all that being said, Disneyland & Magic Mountain, take notes! Guests should come first not greed!!!!SeaWorld has beautiful scenic views of Mission Bay and the weather was gorgeous! Thanks again for the beautiful memories!!!!"
391,8/2/2019,4,"We had a great time, but feel like the best time to visit the park is right when it opens or after dinner. It's really crowded in the middle of the day. The shows we enjoyed most were the dolphin show, the nighttime sea lion show, and the cirque electrique. Our 2 complaints are 1) the shameless pushing of cheesy merchandise everywhere you turn and 2) allowing guests who have paid extra to cut everyone in the long lines and get reserved seating in the best areas of the shows. Since we were visiting with a child with a disability, we felt like we didn't see any accommodations for children in that situation. Lots of stairs. Park didn't feel very accessible. If we wanted to sit in an area that would be easier for him to access, we felt like we would have to pay for the ""extra fee"" for reserved seating."
392,7/10/2018,4,"Always enjoy sea world, but it's getting more and more expensive. Â Teachers can get in for free, so check that out online. Â Also, the dine with orcas show at lunch was not worth the money. Â Sorry, but the quality of the buffet was lacking. Â Otherwise, nice rides and animal displays."
393,8/1/2018,4,"I would like thank the workers, trainers, medical staff, rescue personnel & volunteers that work so hard on behalf of the sea creatures on site and that are brought in to receive emergency assistance when required. I know Sea World has taken a lot of heat in the past and there were many mistakes made as well as intentional shenanigans pulled by corporate in the name of the almighty dollar but the vast majority of the people working with the public and especially those in direct contact with the animals seem to be very caring and responsible. There will always be some bad apples in any workplace who do lousy work or have a bad attitude. That's reality. I visit the park about 2 or 3 times a year due to a program they make available to individuals working in certain fields. The great majority of interactions I have had with Sea World staff from custodial, food service, ticket sales, public relations, & security have been positive. They've been courteous and helpful and it's not like I'm a VIP by any means. My visit today was short but pleasant. My wife and I started by attending the Orca show but we did something we never did before, we sat in the Splash Zone. This is the area closest to the tank with the highest likelihood of getting a large quantity of water dumped on you. We picked our location in the front row near the end of the left side of the stage based on my logical but somewhat flawed reasoning. ""A killer whale will not want to injure itself by leaping too close to the stage so would be more likely to jump near the center of the tank or at least away from edge of the stage"". Makes sense right? The flaw in my logic was that the whale has...ITS TAIL and can splash people that way from any part of the tank although the very ends of the stage did seem to get off pretty easy. So yes I got splashed a bit but it felt REALLY GOOD on a hot day and we didn't get drenched like people closer to the center (score a few points for me).We also went to see the animal rescue presentation in the theater that used to house the Madagascar show but it was like watching TV on Saturday morning along with the Dog Whisperer. The plus was COLD AC!!! That was something I could appreciate. Sooo, time to shut up huh? A good day. Any day away from work is a good day."
394,7/22/2018,5,Having fun with my family. We have year around passes so we visit 4 times a month. The children learners a lot about sea animals. The rides are awesome
395,8/1/2019,3,"First time visit to Sea World, and it left a lot of lasting impressions, but the overall one was that I never need to come back again. I felt like the park is being pulled in too many directions without a focus. It seems as though halfway into making a zoo, they decided to make an amusement park. The one thing I did enjoy were the shows, specifically the dolphin and orca show. However, some of the areas to view animals need some TLC. The artic zone was very cool. The park seemed as though it was running short staffed in every section, or the employees were young and you could tell they didn't want to be there based on their body language. Several aspects of the park seemed like they had no idea how to manage a crowd. There was trash everywhere. And no soap in any of the restrooms, or the sting ray bay or the other pools where you can reach in. The food areas took a long time to get food, and felt like the park just needed an overall lesson in management."
396,3/30/2017,5,"I understand the controversy around SeaWorld. That being said, I wanted to take my family there. To me, it's an marine life zoo. It's hours are 10am-6pm. We went on a weekday at the end of March. Â It was great. Not too crowded or hot. The park is just the right size for younger kids. You can do the whole park- the 4 shows, all aquariums and touch tanks, and several rides before 5pm. We even had a leisurely lunch. I can see how the park may be too small for older kids. They'd run through it all in a few hours. There is also an entire section of Sesame Street rides and activities for littles. Food is meh and (expectedly) expensive. You can bring in your own food and drinks. Which I recommend. One great thing is that they serve adult beverages! Â and !!!! Oh yeah! Mama likey! Weekday tickets are $55 for ages 3+ and parking was $17."
397,8/1/2019,1,I would give zero stars if possible. Had season passes for 8 years now. I work with seaworld putting up there rollercoaster. So I called seaworld customer service and they told me i had to buy a platinum pass to upgrade from silver pass and they would refund my silver pass. Now i call back today 2 weeks later on hold for an hour trying to figure it out . Asking were my refund is they wont refund either pass. Completely unprofessional and dissapointed with supervisors. Never buying season passes again my family is done going there. BOYCOTT seaworld overpriced and horrible customer service Supervisors!!!
398,1/5/2019,5,A day at sea world will make you smile. Don't miss the dolphin petting zoo . Christmas is a great time to visit they go all out with the lights and the Christmas tree that has its own dj and light show ! Love sea world any time of year.
399,4/21/2018,1,Line to just get through security check half mile long. Waited 45min to get food.Not enough staff. won't be back
400,7/20/2019,3,Bought the all day dining deals which was a great deal although the lines for the participating restaurants we long and not managed appropriately with enough servers. I am still waiting in line at Pineapple Pete's. It's been 30 minutes so far and I haven't even got through the doors. There is an additional line in there. Â Very frustrated and hungry. Â This was also the same for the other participating restaurants I visited today. Â I am not a happy camper.
401,7/19/2018,5,Sea world is great for locals especially if you have little ones and a year membership for only 8 dollars a month how can you beat that? My son loves coming here whenever and gets to get all his energy out which is great for mom!
402,1/26/2019,5,"Had a wonderful experience with the dolphin trainer! She had just finished training with the majestic animals and was still dripping when she came out of the tank, but she didnt hesitate to engage us and answer all our questions. Did you know dolphins mate belly to belly?"
403,5/20/2018,5,Tons of family fun!!! Various places that make learning fun for the kids. Plenty of great food to eat. Lockers for your items if you want to rent it. I saw this today you can actually rent a charging port and cable for your phone and refill battery to reach a full charge
404,2/13/2016,4,"This SeaWorld location is even better than I expected. The exhibits were much more interactive than I remember the other locations to be. I visited at the end of January and some exhibits were closed since it's off season. This also meant that the park was much more mellow so overall a win. The exhibits were very well done. I like that most of the exhibits had several ways to view the animals. The penguins had an indoor viewing area as well as an outdoor viewing area. Animals that can be viewed in water had underground viewing areas to see them swim, but also upper viewing areas to see them above water as well. The multiple viewing areas made it possible to see the animals in a variety of ways. The interactive areas were the best parts of the park. At the entrance there are several small pools with animals that are for touching like crab and stingrays. The dolphins were the coolest interactive feature. You could go right up to the pool and touch them. The dolphins also welcomed people to play with them by throwing balls to the dolphins in the pool. A dolphin even threw a ball out in an attempt to get my brother to throw a ball in. It was really cool.There are many other interactive exhibits available at the park as well. My brother and I did the Penguin Encounter on our visit. That'll be a separate review, but was an awesome experience."
405,5/2/2018,3,This place was cool. Some of the rides didn't work. Also paid for wristband to eat at different places inside but had a lot of them closed . Really not worth it and pay $36 .00 for so many to be close. What's the point. Parking is $20.00. Lot of shows were not available. But other then that it was ok.
406,1/24/2019,5,"I did the penguins up close tour with Michelle as my tour guide, she was AMAZING! She did such a great job teaching us about them, she was so knowledgeable and personable, really made our day a million times better :)The entire experience was phenomenal, we're definitely coming back, 5 stars"
407,1/24/2019,4,"It's smaller than I thought but it's worth the annual pass if you get it. The shows are good, you get discounted prices on food if you have an annual pass as well. It's a great time with friends and family to just walk around and take in the San Diego weather."
408,5/29/2017,3,Came to sea world Â and nice vibe cool animals family time ...good beer for a cloudy humid day went on the rides drank beer checked out the new land good time !!!
409,7/15/2018,5,"I love the environment at SeaWorld ,my 3 year old loved the Aquarium and the face expression he made when he seen the Orcas was priceless.Looking fwd to come back soon from the San Fernando Valley."
410,1/10/2016,4,"Love the idea that they have rides. Â I especially like the Atlantis ride. You don't get too bored while waiting in line because of the story build up. The ride is a combination of a Rollercoaster with a water drop.For young families, Â like ours, it was good to have a small kids area. Â The rides were suitable for our toddlers. Â There's a big mat with good shading and safety provisions that gives the caregivers a breather. Â Kids can run, walk, and crawl around or build blocks without running the risk or scraping or bumping on a hard surface. The shows were entertaining. Â  We didn't go for the adult rides. So the shows and small kids rides made it worth it.We ended the day in the Ray area. We got to touch the rays and see them glide and brush their bodies across our arms. Â And just before exiting the park, we got to deep our hands for free cuticle cleaning from the tiny fishes! EXTRA:I liked how they had a variety of meal options and we're very good compared to other theme parks."
411,7/13/2019,1,"Sea World is a mess and not worth the time or money. The park is filthy, bathrooms throughout the park with dirty diapers on the floor, toilet paper messy and kicked all over the floors. Clearly no one is cleaning or checking these through the day. Lines for food over an hour wait only to see the kitchen and cash registers understaffed for crappy food. The employees are checked out and don't care, not to mention there is not enough of them. We got tickets for free and it still wasn't worth our time to be in a gross and crowded theme park."
412,11/24/2018,1,The attractions and exhibits were fun and informative but the employees are very rude and made it seem like they don't have the time to talk to or help you.
413,5/20/2018,4,Sea world has been in my life for 36 years. I love the park and everything sea world does for marine animals. Their programs for wildlife and conservation efforts are top notch. A lot of our whales and other marine life owe their existence to this company. It's four stars not five for one reason. The orca show and program. It's a shame that a group of people full of ignorance and spite have made the effort what it currently is. I hope this changes in the future. Other than that I hope everyone gets a chance to share the sea world experience.
414,6/29/2018,4,"First time at SeaWorld and I didn't expect it to be such a big place. With that being said, a full day is needed to see all the aquatic animals, ride the roller coasters, and watch all the entertaining/educational shows. Each area is very interactive for the kids which makes learning a little bit more fun for them, and for the parents as well. The theme park is great for all ages and the food is slightly limited, as far as options. The workers need a little bit more training on all areas of the park because not a lot of the team members could give me straight answers to directions or information on shows/events. Overall a great experience and a positive/fun visit for myself and my family. 100% recommend for you and your family to add to your itinerary of fun! :)"
415,6/28/2018,4,"Go on a weekday, it's both cheaper and less crowded, we were able to get good seats for every show and never waited more than 15 minutes for a ride. The animal shows are really what SeaWorld is known for, their trainers do an incredible job. That being said, the exhibits are not unlike any other aquarium, so don't expect the same kind of wonder and child-like amazement that you experience at the shows to translate to the entire park. I will concede that captive animals are generally sad animals, but I love that SeaWorld often takes these animals injured and rehabilitates them; gives them a second lease on life. Also, their proceeds go towards conservation efforts that have a far more positive effect than the negative effect captivity may have on a few animals."
416,4/17/2018,5,"I love coming to SeaWorld and always have, the changes due in the coming years are surely going to be great for not just the sea life that call SeaWorld home, but also for education of the public and conservation efforts being done by and in partnership with SeaWorld.The park is always fun to visit and the animal interaction encounters available are always a bonus perk!"
417,7/31/2017,3,"I brought my son to Sea World San Diego from Boise, Idaho for his 10th birthday, which was on a Sunday. Tickets were purchased ahead of time, so admission was quick and easy. The Dolphin encounter for my son was excellent, and came with a 65 dollar price tag. The exhibits were clean and run well. Don't be tricked into thinking you need to buy front of the line passes, they are $30 each, and we didn't even need them, on a Sunday in July, even. Time your visits to the orca encounter and dolphin show wisely. If you're late, you will scorch in the sun sitting in the bleachers. Just like any theme park, you will guided and routed through stores at every exhibit, they DO offer a service that allows you to shop and pick up your purchased items later. The best store is the one close to the exit. Overall the visit was great, but the major exhibits cause you to have to plan your exploring of the park, and the front of the line passes are a complete waste of money."
418,4/16/2016,5,"I recently went to SeaWorld for the first time with my Teachers Fun Card. Â It gave me free admission and also got 3 of my friends in for free! The shark aquarium was the coolest part. I liked being surrounded by the aquarium. Â The kids enjoyed feeding the sea lions for $5.The Sesame Street water area was cool for the little kids and we got on some rides there too. They liked touching the different sea creatures and putting their hands in the water. The sea lion show was a little corny and lame. Although pricey, I was happy to enjoy a beer at this show. I needed it! The Chile Verde pulled pork fry cone is the best thing I ate there. I would reccomend it! There is really something for everyone at this park! I'm happy they appreciate teachers also!!"
419,5/2/2018,5,"SeaWorld is an excellent place to come down with your family. It's very family friendly and has some great attractions. There's shows, rides, and more! Even if you aren't interested in marine life, SeaWorld is a great place to come down for the day or maybe a couple of days!"
420,1/17/2019,4,"Before this review I want to point out that there is currently quite a bit of construction going on due to the renovation of Journey to Atlantis, the building of Tidal Twister, and soon the building of Mako. This park is one of the best parks you can visit, especially if you come in the off season. Educational, fun, and by going you are supporting their animal rescue program. In the off season there are rarely any major crowds and you can get onto most rides without much of a line. You can walk on to Electric Eel without waiting in line at all at times. You never see that at other SoCal theme parks. The food isn't the greatest but it's a theme park, what do you expect? Their biggest issue is certainly their employees. More specifically, how the employees are lazy. I've had one experience during the summer where the station for Electric Eel was packed with people. There was no such thing as a line in that station. It was a blob. This was, of course, due to an employee who just let everyone in. I've seen people vaping/smoking in non-smoking areas with employees doing nothing about. People have very clearly cut lines and employees do nothing, even if it has been pointed out to them. But other than this Seaworld is a darn good park.Also NEVER GO TO MAMA STELLAS!Easily the worse food in the park. Only redeeming factor is the awesome seating you can get right next to the launch of Manta."
421,7/20/2019,1,All the rides my 6 year old can go on are broken or just not open. Â Will come back in another 20 years.
422,10/25/2018,2,"We came on a Tuesday, and I must say I was verrry underwhelmed and extremely grateful the military gives you free passes for the servicemember and family. I've been to SeaWorld in Orlando when I was much younger, and don't remember being too amused then either , but I never would have thought the park was this dull. There are a few children's rides, and maybe 2 or 3 adult friendly rides. 1 of which was closed for whatever reason. Most of the cafes were closed as well. I think my favorite part of the entire park was the beginning that had the little fish that suck the dead skin off your hands."
423,6/21/2017,4,This was my 1st visit to sea world and I absolutely enjoyed it. I love the rides here yes food is expensive but all amusement parks sells ridiculous high priced foods and drinks. We did pay the upfront parking for $25 totally worth the extra 5 bucks so do it. We went on a Tuesday and it was discounted for about $30 and we paid $61 for a single day. Tips: pack food and a cooler. When you and the family are hungry just exit the park to your car and eat your packed food saves you about $80 on food inside the park. I think the drinks special is worth it to buy a souviner bottle and free refills for the same day and for the year refills are 99cents totally worth it. Shows were very entertaining and they tend to change up the shows which is great for locals there.
424,11/24/2017,3,We went to Sea World on Thanksgiving which was great because it was not very crowded. The park is clean and nice. The reason I gave 3 stars is because we bought the extra add on for Dine with Oracas the problem is they don't tell you that most of the seats are not against the glass which makes it hard to see the whales and our table was in the sun the whole time which was miserable.The one bright spot was my daughter paid $50 for the penguin encounter which see loved!
425,7/7/2018,2,The employees are friendly however everytime we go there is at least 2 rides closed! Why charge so much money if you can't even keep the rides open? Not to mention the hold time to speak with anyone is ridiculous!
426,5/19/2018,5,Love coming here. Hate that animals are locked up but at the same time I like to teach my kids about each animal and letting them experience the excitement.
427,6/21/2018,3,"We visited Sea World about a year and a half ago give or take, and we actually happened to go around Halloween which was kind of cool. The park is pretty big and has some cool things about it but also some sad reminders. Most memorable, at the entry they have a big ""tank"" type thing you can put your hand in and Garra rufa fish will come to your hand and eat the skin off, we saw a fun sea lion and otter show, Dolphin show was good (they're obviously the stars), Orca show was good ( I enjoyed this most) but the Orcas dorsal fins were collapsed and the holding tank was way too small! While the show was good I was and am reminded of the intelligence, capability and strength of these animals as well as what position I have put them in due to my desire for entertainment and choice to attend such a show. Overall, it was enjoyable and not too costly but I wouldn't return."
428,12/15/2015,4,"Honestly, I had an amazing time! I hadn't been to SeaWorld in 20+ years, I think I was 5 when I went for the first and last time. My boyfriend got ticket for us from a friend of his. I didn't realize tickets were so expensive! I think they are about $69 to attend as a regular guest, plus $16 for parking, but since we only paid for parking it wasn't too bad but a bit steep for a family to go (I guess that's a running theme in theme parks these days).We arrived just after 11am when the park opened on a Saturday. There was no line and parking was pretty easy. It was a quick walk from the lot to the entrance. When we arrived, they had the photographer taking your photos, a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and lots of fun shops and places to take the obligatory theme park entrance pic.I loved that they had the 'petting' areas where you could feel the fish, stingrays, crabs, etc. If I were a kid, I would much rather go here than Disneyland. There was a lot to do, the rides were great (the Manta rollercoaster was fast, my boyfriend and I were not prepared for that one) and the staff was super friendly. We went to all the shows which were great. I will say, I loved the animal show a lot! It was so funny and they had cats, dogs, kangaroos, birds, pigs, etc. The dolphin show was great, too. The shamu show was a disappointment. I think since Blackfish came out they changed it into an educational show. Not too exciting, but cool to see the whales.They also have beer, wine and margaritas available for purchase throughout the park and a coffee shop that serves Starbucks! My favorite part? The fact that we got to do the dolphin connection. It was so awesome! The trainer was really smart and you could tell she loved the animals. We got to spend about 20-30 minutes with the dolphin, doing basic commands, playing with her, and taking photos. It was a one of a kind experience!"
429,7/13/2019,1,"Worst amusement park experience in of my life. Â Waited 2.5 hours for food due to waiting in line for 30 minutes only to be evacuated out of the building as soon as we entered. Â Waited 20 minutes to use the restroom. Â Only one restroom open for men and women to share. Â Then to finally get on a ride(Manta) 4 hours after our arrival, the ride shuts down for technical difficulties. Â SeaWorld should be ashamed. Â Worst ever !"
430,7/1/2018,5,As part of 5 day at 5 amusement parks I visited seaworld with family we all enjoyed .we heard all kind of stories about food . Etc food its excellent you need to know where to buy it .we had baby ribs from shipwreck reef cafe .we love it..prices are competitive.if you compare legoland .seaworld .disneyland or california..
431,9/12/2018,3,"Everything was great except one thing..the guest service personnels for date 9/11/18. Rating is 2 whole star less due to just the service Ive received there. We wanted to have my dad experience swimming with dolphins and didnt get to do that. When will he ever be able to do that... probably never since he is already old and it was already hard enough to match schedules to come here today. i arrived at the guest services at around 345. The lady there took a super long time helping the guy at the register do a simple transaction... i listened to their conversation so I know!!!. Seemed like she was working at a very slow pace (dont k ow of its on purpose or not). If she is new then I dont mind and I retract my comment. Then the other real problem was the guy behind the counter. I specificly asked out loud to the lady whether or not im late for the swimming with dolphins just in hope he would get up and help me but he just sat there and the lady kept on being slow. Then 355 came the lady rejected me saying they wont be able to take me for then 4pm event. The walk to the event place wasnt even 1 minute away. I even said i would run there if needed. Â If i ran it wouldve been like 30 seconds max to get there. Everything would of been fine if the guy would have gotten up to help me purchase a ticket which would have taken less than 1 minute (click, click, money exchanged. Ticket received). I regret not purchasing it online myself because I would have Â been able to do a faster job. The lady didnt call the trainers to ask if they will accept me either but did pretend to. I dont know if that was allowed of them to call and get trainer's permission but if they are and she was lazy about it then that would be unacceptable. I got there before 4pm and swimming group were nowhere to be found so I assumed that they were still changing. They didnt get out and into the water until 420!!! All that time I couldve actually ran there, suit in. and still have plenty of time. Guest services people there at that time both need more training on customer service. I work in the customer service industry myself and been a manager before also and this would have not been acceptable by me."
432,11/5/2017,5,"What an awesome experience! Â My kids enjoyed it so much! We had fun from beginning to end. Really enjoyed our family day out.Kids rides, good food, great animal shows... more than expected... Â definetelly going back! Makes me happy to know my kids had fun!It was a good idea to go off season, no lines for the rides, enough space to walk around, and park your strollers. Worth the drive and money."
433,11/16/2018,4,Had a great time with the family. I love that military is free. Will go again the next time in SD. my son loved it.
434,7/5/2019,5,"I am so angry with sea world staff that I literally had to write this before leaving the park. To start we waited in the line to get into the park for over an hour. This wait could have been avoided if the entrance was properly identified. All it would take is signs saying to use both lanes and one lane stripe. Once we got to the parking entrance we were not given our placard showing that we paid for up front parking( we have four small children and my parents) so once we got to the section we paid extra for the staff blocked the entrance to that section and had us walk through traffic back to the parking entrance to obtain the parking placard they neglected to give us. Then on top of that they told us to move our car or they would have it towed. So now the additional $120 dollars we paid for parking in front has taken an hour longer then if we would have just parked for $44 dollars and walked. Also security was extremely rude when we entered the park. I am hopeful that the rest of our day will make up for the difficult staff we have had to deal with so far. My advice, at this point I will never come back to this facility. However I do believe what they do here for the animals has value to the world and I hope they can continue to do it, that just may have to get rid of some bad apples first."
435,7/30/2017,5,"I loved my visit to seaworld. I think they get a lot of flack from the movie Blackfish but come on, they do plenty of conservation too! What world are people living in that they only expect good things to come out of things. Even mother Teresa had very controversial issues! The park is well designed and I bought the quick queue for the rides and the shows. I don't think the reserved seating for the shows was worth it at all. they barely checked tickets and people came and went into reserved seating as they pleased. Also, I went on a busy summer day and NONE of the auditoriums were ever completely filled. The quick queue for the rides was WAY worth it though. My only complaint was that the lady selling us the quick pass 'accidentally' charged us for the reserved shows option too and Â I felt we were tricked into buying it.Seaworld combines your needs for aquarium as well as theme park"
436,7/3/2019,1,"First post of the day. Security went quick. Scanning tickets went well. That's when the wheels fell off. We had purchased the dining passes. Went to customer relations to get them. Carlos was the rep. System was slow. Took a long time to get our purchase recognized and the wrist bands. I asked him an additional question regarding the front of the line passes we purchased. He couldn't answer a single question. Not helpful at all. Went to our first ride. I had to show the passes again after a lengthy discussion with the attendant. He said he would call ahead and let them know that the kids where coming but didn't have a pass to show them. I went to the photo desk to ask to speak with a manager as it is unacceptable to require a pass be shown at every ride. The girl at the photo desk said she couldn't call a manager as it involved a ride and that was a different area. I'm amazed that she isn't able to call a manager for any guest reason or request. I went back to the ride and requested a manager. Enrique showed up and wasn't able to provide any help. I don't believe he was a manager. I get the feeling they initially just pass guests off from one person to another in hopes that they give up from their ineptitude. He didn't tell me anything I didn't already know and provided no solutions to remedy the issue. I truly wanted to leave this crappy park, but we didn't. We'll see how the rest of the day goes. More to come.2nd post - The rest of the day went fairly well. A couple of stupid things with the dining experiences. Just a general feeling of not caring about the experience. It's been a few years but the extra charges for certain rides is something.new to me. I don't need to go back to this park. This may be my last time here. Nothing to miss anyway."
437,7/1/2018,5,Great fun go early very early and park close to exit street easier to get out buy the Â refill soda and bring you own food pack it in back packs this allows you to ride the rides and walk easy
438,7/1/2017,3,"The park is ok. Manta is the best ride. I rode it 4 times. The second best ride is Journey to Atlantis. Arctic wild needs a serious upgrade with the graphics. I liked the gondola ride. We went today, which is a Friday in the summer. The park was pretty empty so we didn't need to buy quick queue. The food at the park is underwhelming and horribly expensive so try to bring your own. As for shows, I liked Orca encounter the best. The sea lions and dolphins were cute too. The Sea Rescue one made me shed a tear. Also, there was this one rude and unprofessional worker at the Manta. Â She basically pointed us off the ride because we had some personal belongings with us. While I understand that is your policy to not have items, she was extremely rude in conveying her point and made me feel like I was beneath her. Other than that, everyone was very nice. :)"
439,12/18/2018,5,"We have been pass members for years because the education for my children is invaluable. My toddlers understand what whales eat, how penguins live, and why taking care of the oceans matters. Last year they added the Christmas program and we love it. The songs are traditional and upbeat. They captured the Christmas spirit and we hope they keep this program for years to come. We certainly plan to keep our passes for years."
440,1/11/2017,3,"My wife and I were in San Diego and knew we would be near here 3 times in the next six weeks, so we got the yearly pass, which had free parking for when we would be back in January (We were in walking distance in November) Because they charge $20 for parking, total rip-off!They basically have 6 shows you can see and two roller coasters, plus some aquariums. The dolphin and animal show were my faves, besides Shamu.We saw one of the last Shamu shows, which was cool, but the Black Fish movie killed it. They said they had a 10% drop in attendance.The Manta Roller Coaster is awesome, one of the magnet starting rides that shoot you out fast from a stop still. The Aquarius coaster is pretty lame for getting so wet in the winter.The other shows were all cool, but way expensive for a bunch of shows. (I realize they have to pay everyone and feed the fish, but it is crazy expensive for what you get.)The skyride is pretty weak but fun, and the tower over San Diego is fun.A fun three days for the few hours we were there, but I doubt we will be back.Worth seeing once I guess."
441,5/1/2018,4,"Came here for our family vacation, and I must say I was impressed! Growing up on an island, learning about marine life is second nature, and were always taught to respect the wildlife by not interfering with them. That being said, the animals I witnessed here seem to bond well with their trainers and SeaWorld educates people on their rescue efforts at each exhibit, so it's hard not to be impressed.While I came here with my SoCal pass, I know I would pay the full park amount next time I'm here. The employees really like to promote SeaWorld's conservation efforts which all seem pretty impressive.The park itself is currently more of a marine life park than an amusement park, but it seems like they're trying to change that, unfortunately, but it's still a lot of fun to go to!Upon entering, you come upon to Explorers Reef, which is a fun place to get to touch some fish. They even have that one fish that eats the dead skin off of you? Not too sure what it was, but those pedicures are a popular tourist attraction in Asia. All the shows are fun to watch, but my favorite is the orca show. Get there early (line up) in order to get a seat out of the splash zone. If you don't mind, the splash zone had a lot of seats when we went! The other exhibits are impressive too and well worth a visit! Personally, I didn't ride anything, because the lines were too long, but it seems like it would be fun if we had more time!"
442,10/5/2018,5,"Love this place!! The shows have become so educational, it's great. And the new roller coaster is incredible, nothing like being terrified with a huge smile on your face, lol"
443,1/23/2018,2,"I understand that it's winter and that I went on a Sunday (1/14), but a lot of the park seemed to be close. The bigger rides were not open, which I was looking forward to. I came San Diego because I was on a work trip and had a day off with my coworkers. We decided to add something fun to our trip. We started out by seeing the penguins, turtles, walrus, beluga and more. We got to go on the Wild Arctic ride which was fun! Very rough, so not recommended for anyone who may experience any body pains. I found it really fun though. We were able to see the dolphin show that day too! Really fun! We got to the show a little late so we had to sit in the splash zone. Just be prepared to get soaked! They do sell towels and ponchos to people sitting in the splash zone. The Manta ride was really fun. The line was long, and we waited about 45 mins but it seemed like it moved pretty quick. I didn't mind it too much.Lastly, we went on the SkyTower which was amazing! It was amazing because this was our last ride for the day (the park closed at 5pm), so the sun was setting and made everything much more beautiful! It was a nice relaxing ride to end the day there. My favorite part was all the cute animals and the rides I was able to get on. For the price of $90 and having a lot of the bigger rides closed, I didn't think it was worth the price. I just wish there was more to do."
444,12/23/2018,5,"Went to sea world San Diego in December 21st 2018. My review is on the Santa village that is set up Christmas time. We signed up to be called to see Santa and they called us to come back about an hour later so we went on some rides while we waited to be called. Once they called us there 2 elves there entertaining us so it wouldn't be so dull as there was a family in front of us. They were very nice talking to the kids asking them what was on their Christmas list, making Christmas jokes making us laugh very pleasant. Once we got in to see Santa he was very jolly and interactive with the kids. Loved it"
445,12/23/2015,2,"To all you PETA nuts out there, these animals were saved from imminent death. Oh, you're upset that schenmus space is slightly fettered down? Well, it's better than being turned into sashimi by jiro. Oh, and in Japan they'd kill the whale less humanely as well by plugging their holes.... And no, not the good one.My problem with seaworld is the fact that their idea of a theme park is souvenirs and food, rather than say the attraction themselves. The exhibits were just unimaginative and lacking in the interactive department. The shed aquarium in Chicago is a better deal. This seems rather intermediate if you ask me and houses animals as a temporary asylum."
446,6/13/2019,3,"No water, stood outside in sun for hours until opened later than we were told. We were in the front of the line but when only a couple of gates were opened we ended up being cut by nearly everyone behind us because of it. We usually have a great experience and appreciate the courteous staff. Unfortunately this experience was a bit disappointing as we had family with us from out of state."
447,11/28/2016,3,"This was the first time taking our 6 year old twin daughters to SeaWorld. Â And they had a GREAT time!!!Their highlights were:+ Â Touch Tanks. Â They were reluctant at first, by worked up the courage to touch the doctor fish (???) that nibble your skin, horseshoe crabs, bamboo sharks, etc.+ Â Sesame Street Bay of Play. Â They really enjoyed the age-appropriate rides and the small water/splash area to cool off. Â Fortunately, when we were there, there were little or no lines to the rides, so having a second or third turn was no problem.+ Â Penguin Encounter. Â They liked the conveyor belt taking you past the penguin exhibit.+ Â SkyTower. Â The whole family enjoyed the great views of the park.+ Â Sugar!!! Â Or course, the day wouldn't be complete without indulging on some Dippin Dots and cotton candy!!!Our girls were pooped after visiting these and didn't have any energy left for any of the shows. Â  We'll definitely have to come back to see those next time.Tip #1: Â Pay the extra $ to park closer.Tip #2: Â Bring sun screen and lots of water.Tip #3: Â Everyone seemed to have to same idea arriving just as the park opened - so there was quite a bit of traffic getting in and parking. Â Maybe arriving later in the afternoon would be a better idea."
448,10/13/2015,4,"We had an enjoyable visit to SeaWorld, was better than our expectations. Our visit here was more enjoyable than Legoland. It's low season so the line up for rides at SeaWorld were very short: vs Legoland with its horrendous line up (everything there was running at less than half capacity)We enjoyed all the shows (shamu, dolphins, seal). It's a relatively small theme park so you will probably need about 4 hours to do everything."
449,6/16/2018,4,"The only issue is that even though it's not ""vacation season"" the hours are limited and the prices seem to be the same.Love the Sea Lion show and they rides are well done."
450,7/2/2015,4,"Look, I know there's a lot of controversy surrounding SeaWorld due to Blackfish and such, but people also seem to forget that SeaWorld does a world of good. Yes, they're a for-profit corporation in the entertainment arena, but they also have a huge role in education and preservation. It chaps my hide when people blindly quote Blackfish without giving any regard to the good deeds that SeaWorld does.Are they perfect? Probably not. But name one corporation in this world that IS. I'm not normally a Pollyanna, but I do want to believe that the staff and the company truly want to heal the world's oceans while taking the time to educate kids (and some adults) on the challenges the ocean's creatures face. I also think it's a tiny bit unfair that people lambaste SeaWorld for keeping animals in captivity, yet happily fork over their money for places like the Zoo or Wild Animal Park. NOT that I'm criticizing either of those institutions! I'm merely pointing out the inconsistencies that I see. /EndRantWe went to SeaWorld during the last weekend of the Seven Seas Festival. I was expecting it to be packed - indeed, the parking lot made me think we'd be packed in like sardines (har, har) - but I was proven wrong. The park was packed, yes, but it didn't *feel* packed, if you get my distinction. We didn't have to worry about folding in on ourselves in order to move.It's changed a lot since our last visit! Or maybe it's just because of the way it was set up for the Festival. Either way, it seemed there was a lot of space between shops and stadiums and attractions. The Festival itself was surprisingly fun. We bought the ""beer and food pass"", which basically gave us five tastings each. There were several stations scattered throughout the park, with different cuisines per location, and each brewery was local (LOVED that!) We were given a ""guidebook"" when we arrived, which let us know what we could expect from each region, and which provided a (surprisingly difficult to follow) map. (Side note - we totally got lost trying to find one location. We had to stop to ask an employee, and it turns out we had walked right by it. Twice.)There were a decent amount of tables scattered around the regions, which is handy when you've got a beer in one hand and a small plate in the other. They were all gaily decorated and fit in with the theme they were trying to cultivate (well, maybe not *all*. Their Greece region was sadly plain...)The food at the Festival was good - we had some clear favorites - but it didn't fill us up, especially considering we walked back and forth throughout the park for almost seven hours. Still, we went in knowing we'd be getting taster-sized portions, so we weren't surprised by that piece. The beer offerings were also very good. We found a couple new (to us) breweries that we're eager to hunt down, which is always nice.We didn't get to try any of the rides (because lots of booze and sun is NOT a recipe for rolly coasters, in my world), but I'm sure we'll hit those on our next trip. The only show we saw was Cirque de la Mer, which we both loved (see my review for details and pictures). It's really well done, and I'd highly recommend catching at least one show. I don't know how many they do throughout the day, but it's worth a visit!I do have to say that finding the beluga whale exhibit (my personal favorite, and the thing I was looking forward to the most) was almost impossible. One change from our last visit (years ago, clearly) is that you have to go through the Wild Arctic ride/walk-through in order to get to the whales. That's not immediately apparent as you're walking by. It's also not immediately apparent that you can walk the exhibit, instead of going on the ""ride"" - though it may have been sheer exhaustion that clouded our ability to figure that one out. Still, the belugas are tucked way in the back, and as we were walking through, I ended up missing almost everything else (me as we were leaving, ""They had polar bears in there?!"") I guess I know for next time...I think the only thing that I regretted about our day at SeaWorld is that there weren't a whole lot of employees around to ask questions of, or to engage with. For example, there's a space where you can stop to watch the trainers interacting with the orcas, and it's great to experience - especially when the trainers have the orcas interact with the group standing there - but it would have been nice to have someone to ask questions of, or to get information from. I'm sure that's not feasibly - they'd basically have to have some poor bloke standing in the blazing sun all day long in the off-chance that some tourist has a question - but I think it'd be a nice feature. You know, something like the tide pools, where they have an employee keeping up a steady stream of chatter and information.At any rate, I do appreciate all the good that SeaWorld does for the ocean. And really, how else can I get so close to an orca or beluga whale?"
451,6/27/2018,5,"I been to Seaworld ever since I was a kid so I have seen the changes of this park. I been an anual past on and off because I wasn't so impressed anymore with the shows which were the same and they had only a few rides. But Monday I decided to get the anual pass since they had open new rides and stuff. I was kind of regretting my decision after my online purchase to be honest. I decided to go that same day which was Monday June 25, 2018 and let me just say I saw a HUGE difference in the park I was impressed with the laser lights it made the park look alive. They have many new rides not just the Electric Eel but fun rides for toddlers too (so is not just the Sesame Bay of Play anymore). Honestly I had a great experience at Seaworld. They had a section were there is a DJ which played good music kids were having a lot of fun dancing and even some parents were dancing. The park has come up with more creative ways to enjoy your day its not all about animals shows like before. I highly recommend visiting Seaworld this summer and see it for yourself."
452,10/19/2016,4,"SeaWorld... Â After visiting for the first time (10/8/16), did I enjoy it?Yes.Would I go back again?Yes, especially if I get good deals on tickets.PROS- beautiful landscaping- touch tanks- mostly clean... recycling encouraged- loved the energy - from both pets & trainers - particularly at the Pets Rule showCONS- parking... *SMH*- no snacks or your own food in except bottled water (bags are checked!)- rides are for bigger kidsTIPS- ""up close parking"" ($22) is worth it if you have kids, strollers, mobility chairs, etc.- now through Oct. 31: one free child (ages 3-9) admission ticket with each full-paid adult ($93)- Halloween Spooktacular (through Oct. 30, 2016) was fun! Have your kiddos dress up!A Note about ""Blackfish"": Â I watched it a couple of years ago on Netflix. It clearly impacted many people's perspectives of SeaWorld, yet, it was after all... just one story. I never before saw any live shows with trainers in the water with the Orcas. But for me watching the mid-morning show (which is said to evolve even more ""natural-like"" in 2017) was cool. Many people seemed bored by it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it because I know I may never see them in the wild.Review #510'16 Challenge #76"
453,5/27/2019,4,"First. Thank you Sea World, for honoring me and veterans everywhere with your free passes. I had a few questions as we explored the park, but rarely found a staff member to assist. One food stand had a cheerful employee, but she was being grossly overworked, as her line was never-ending and she was by herself. She lamented she had no spoons for the Dippin Dots, but they should be here soon! You can't see the penguins in the Penguin Encounter because the glass is fully covered in moisture. It was explained it was due to the difference in temperatures, but I've been coming for years and couldn't understand why 66 degrees outside and whatever the temperature inside would cause this. And if it was the culprit, why it couldn't have an employee assisting with clearing it. It wasn't terrible, but there was more litter than I would expect. Did not once spot an employee 'policing the area'. The shows were incredible. I wish more could be put into them than into the rides, but I guess the economy of the park warrants them. Overall, it was a good day. My criticisms are only meant to be constructive. I support Sea World and all it does for animals. I always have, and I always will."
454,7/30/2018,1,"I had absolutely the worst experience possible while buying tickets at the SeaWorld gate. I asked to borrow a pen and the woman snapped back at me with ""Only if you are going to return it."" Â It was really strange to hear such a response while you are about to make a $220 purchase. It got escalated from there because their system was not working to update the payment method at which point the same SeaWorld employee started mocking me for my credit card not working. I am serious, this was really strange and I was too angry to be embarrassed. Called the manager who did or said nothing to the employee and took his time processing my payment. The way the employees and their managers treat customers feel less like a resort Â or amusement park in sunny California but more like a run down KFC / Taco Bell in a dark alley in Philadelphia. Â  If you are thinking about going to SeaWorld, really don't bother. There are so much more to do and see in San Diego. Â And yeah, the killer whales die there at only about half their natural life expectancy and they look miserable. It is a depressing experience for everyone so please save yourself and your family the heartache."
455,6/1/2015,3,"People love Sea World, but if you're going, don't accidentally flip on CNN while the documentary film ""Blackfish"" is playing. It will ruin the Sea World experience for you forever. Â [hints-- Who: Orca and his trainer. What: an unpleasant exchange. When: 2010. How it ended: not well for the trainer.]It's nice to see the animals and the shows and all, and the park is kept super clean. The shows are less than spectacular now that the animals are supposed to ""act naturally"" and ""perform"" less as the trainers are no longer allowed in the pool with the whales.This park still draws large crowds. Everything is packed in pretty tight. This results in you spending about 45 minutes waiting for each show to start. In return, you get 20 minute ""performances"" on stage watching whales, dolphins, and sea lions jump and eat fish. Is it worth the $85 per person? It's your call.If you can find more compelling reasons to come to Sea World, like the PREMIUM Dolphin Encounter, Beluga Interaction Program, Dining With Shamu (much better than Dining FOR Shamu), and the Penguins Up-Close Tours, you'd have a better time.Also look for special events like the recent Seven Seas, one-of-a-kind food festival. This event rawked!"
456,1/13/2018,1,"Horrible! I'm so upset. Every time we come here, Journey to Atlantis is always closed down and now Manta is closed. We pay every month to have our seasonal passes just for these awesome rides but why have them when they're always closed? Let me remind you it's not very close from our house. A 2hr drive in fact! They should try harder to have them available for all who pay good hard money for them! This will be our last season here in Sea World!#Update: Wow! There's a lot more attractions closed. Unbelievable"
457,10/21/2018,4,It is a must for people to see! They help many sea creatures and one can have a greater appreciation for sea life when they leave. Just like any theme park the food is a little pricy. Staff are super friendly and educated!
458,5/24/2015,5,"We went to SeaWorld today for the NEW Seven Seas Festival (which has been running of for the entire month of May).We have season passes with free parking, so this made for a bonus day out for us. The day started out gloomy, but weather.com stated the sun wold be shining by 4pm and the weather was accurate! This made for a great day in the sun with live music, food, beer and wine! Â  This is the first year of the Seven Seas Festival which offers an array of international flavors of food (much from local sources) with wine and craft brews (mostly from California and France, with delicious choices). The booths set up included; California ocean and farm, French, Mediterranean, Latin, Asian and Caribbean themed foods. The food was spectacular! I was seriously impressed! Kudos to chef Axel Dulrolf and his team at SeaWorld for pulling off this fantastic event. There were ambassadors for all the stages, friendly and knowledgeable staff at the food booths and the chef and brewers had times set up for meet and greets!  To list some of the amazing foods we tried (and there was NOTHING we didn't like)...Organic Tomato Soup w/ Truffle SandwichBacon Bacon Waffle StickSea Salt Carmel and Rasberry Vanilla MacaroonsHoney Cinnamon BeignetsJamacian Baby Back RibsYa Mon Jerk ChickenCave Aged Humboldt Fog CheeseFingerling PotatoesArtisianal Artichoke Chicken Mozerella SausageCotton Candy Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e'There were at least 5 other things we would have loved to try, but we also wanted to enjoy some attractions and the music that was part of the day. We attended the Pet's Rule Show today, which was entertaining - a show consisting of dogs, cats , pigs and birds. There is an opportunity after this show to visit and pet the animals in the production. Really entertaining and fun!Another highlight of the day included the lives performances by local bands. We started the day out at the French Stage to see the Pop,Gypsy, Accordian player and performer, Melinda West from Los Angeles. She was fantastic! We ended the day with the Ska band Suburban Legends from the OC. They were fun...especially the breakout performance of Neil Diamond's ""Sweet Caroline"". I found a new red wine today called ""Eruption"" and that's not something you get to do at an entertainment park every day! Â Sea World plans to do this again next year (there is a part of me that doesn't want anyone to really know about it...it was that good!)It was that good!"
459,9/1/2015,4,"I saw the anti-SeaWorld documentary ... and liked it.But ... SeaWorld still is a place I want to visit. I remember going as a young child and it virtually hasn't changed in decades. It makes me more fascinated by the ocean and its life.My young children liked it and learn a lot about marine life. There's a lot to see. There are a lot of touch pools to reach out and touch creatures.The whales, from the documentary, were the only part that made me feel a bit uneasy. The show hadn't changed since I visited in early 2013 even after the aforementioned documentary. I like SeaWorld's advertising campaign about caring for animals and would have liked to have seen it in the show. I remember the trainers going into the water with the killer whales as a kid but they sure as hell ain't going near the tank other than to toss fish in these days.I mean, yeah, it feels a bit like a circus because whales, dolphins and sea lions do tricks in brief 15-20 minute shows. But they get fed well. And they don't have to get killed by other sea life.I really like the pet show with dogs, cats and a pig. Those animals look like they're having fun.Food here isn't bad. There are some decent options including a Starbucks counter in front. We went to Pineapple Pete's and had delicious ice cream for an afternoon snack.There's alcohol everywhere. Can't beat that.Sorry, I'm going back, folks. Put me in a tank and make me perform tricks for food and I'm in."
460,3/18/2019,1,"Don't waste your time and money. Â We just left after two hours. Â Many things closed, lots of carnival games and a few rides which is not what we wanted from a Sea World. Â You would think there would be more animals. Â We enjoyed the sea Lions at La Holla Cove more."
461,1/1/2016,3,"I do believe Sea World means well and I do think they treat their animals as best they can. The trainers really seem to love their job and care for their animals. I appreciate all the rescue efforts they do tremendously. However, the entertainment value is fading here. The park itself is starting to feel old and a little outdated. Nonetheless, we did enjoy the ""Sea Lions Live"" show a lot. My one year old enjoyed it too and was able to laugh and clap quite a bit. The shark tank area is still incredible; I've always enjoyed that. The Orca show isn't what I remembered and was uncomfortably crowded. It felt like the whales aren't doing as many ""flips"" and tricks, and certainly the show has been edited to remove the trainers from swimming with them. The people at the show are incredibly annoying - everyone is clamoring in front of you to get a better photo or what not despite the repeated, but not often enough, reminders from the small number of staff trying to keep the aisles clear. I'm just not convinced between parking and the price of admission, it's worth it right now. It can be costly to bring a family here, especially if you want some food, water, so on and so forth."
462,6/20/2017,5,"I always love going to SeaWorld. From the attractions to the roller coasters to the sea animals, they've got a lot going on and I love it all. I enjoy that you can touch many of the sea creatures in the front of the park. I feel like the park does a great job at making the sea life approachable and easily accessible. The new attraction was being opened when we went but the ride stopped several times when we were in line so we left the line after about 40 minutes (it was a 2 hour wait). Many of the older rides such as Manta and Atlantis only had a five minute wait. My boys enjoy the Sesame Street Play area even though they're 9 & 11. They like crawling through the tunnels & climbing the nets, there's so much to do!The food does tend to feel expensive but sides such as fruit & salad can go a long way (especially if you bring in some of your own food). There are many healthy options at all food places. I always saw salads, strawberries, watermelon and pineapple at all restaurants. If you're into beer you won't be disappointed, almost every food stand offers a good selection of microbrews."
463,5/6/2015,5,"I don't care what the world's bandwagon is saying about SeaWorld...it is a San Diego icon.They rescue injured animals and reintroduce them in the wild. They have a huge focus on education.They hook up teachers with passes (i personally prefer to just purchase my pass so my family's entire pass expires together)the new water park is super cool!it's a perfect day just to take a stroll through the park...you don't even have to actually ""do"" anything to enjoy seaworld..love the new rollercoaster (manta) it is so much fun! and they even provide free lockers to put your stuff in while you ride! love that they don't try to take your money at every opportunity!the new entrance is amazing!! love it...make sure you get those little cleaner fish to take care of your cuticles.i am so glad to have Sea world so close by...this is the one theme park pass that I always renew."
464,4/23/2018,5,"What a great place to visit...yes I know since CNN/Blackfish SeaWorld has gotten a bad rep. Well...here's another side of the story. First of all, yes it sucks for some animals to hold in such small confinements...but it gives adults as well as kids the opportunity to see them in real life and be an inspiration/educational experience they would otherwise never be able to encounter.The entire park has so much to offer...not just fun rides, good food (beats other parks aka the mouse one by miles) and many educational parts.I wish CNN would have produced a report about SeaWorld Rescue..to this date more than 31 000 animals have been saved thanks to SeaWorld....It's a great park and an annual membership with parking is only $109/- Â Its worth it ...You will like it and your kids to..you all will learn something. An experience you will never forget for the better."
465,6/3/2019,1,"Sea world is going down hill. Not worth getting a yearly pass or visiting for a day. We got free tickets, which was the only reason why we went, but only confirmed we wouldn't spend our money to come here. They don't offer cubbies at the rides for your stuff. You have to pay for a locker. You can't walk w/ your bags through the line & have another person hold them for you so they can take the next ride. The ride operator said there's no using the fast line if u are waiting on another rider unless you pay. So instead of waiting 45 min for all to ride 1 ride, we have to wait 1 1/2 hrs. Just no longer family Â friendly. Too bad. Also rides were to open at 11 and they were still testing them, so the lines just clogged up the walk ways, & their new ride Tidal Twister that just opened May 24th was closed 6/3 b/c it was broken. Just an all around disappointment. It wouldn't have been so bad if they weren't trying to gouge you at everything. I know the lockers are a buck but you are waiting more than an hr. for a ride. Knotts Berry Farms is way better."
466,4/2/2019,1,"Girl working the line at manta stopped us for a purse containing my wife's colostomy treatment, yet let over twenty other guests pass with back packs. She should be fired and her employment executed. She is terrible. She was working on April 1st, 2019 at 12:30z fire her immediately. She is rude and had some breath that smelt like she may have a dead tooth."
467,11/25/2017,5,"SeaWorld is so fantastic, I am baffled it would only get an average of 3.5 stars. This place is a solid 5 stars, period. Imagine if Disney Land got 3.5 stars. That wouldn't make any sense. Well, the same applies to SeaWorld. This place is world class and by far one of the best attractions in southern California.I will discuss more at the end of the review, but first here's what I love about SeaWorld:1. The animal shows are fantastically entertaining. Do not miss any of these shows: - Orcas- Dolphins- Sea LionsYou may choose to seat in the ""wet zone"" for a truly memorable experience. 2. The park has tons to offer, from shows to rides to play structures to exhibits. You could easily spend 2-3 days without running out of new things to try.3. You can dip your hand into several petting pools and touch manta rays, bamboo sharks and most entertaining cleaner fish. 4. The talent of the performers is top-notch. If there's a show with singing involved, the talent is almost Broadway worthy. 5. The park is impeccably clean and well-managed. It looks like everything is brand spanking new. 6. The staff is super friendly and enthusiastic. 7. We were here before Christmas, and everything was gorgeously decorated. There were lots of special shows for the holiday. The main show had a singing cast of over a dozen very talented singers performing all the major Christmas song. There were even live animals in the show. We also got to meet Santa in his house, in what was one of the nicest Santa encounters we've ever had (the costume and decorations were top notch and Santa spent lots of time with each child.)With all the great things SeaWorld has to offer, how come the 3.5 stars on Yelp?? I am truly baffled. It could be that people vote down SeaWorld because of the bad publicity from the movie Blackfish and allegations that animals are not properly cared for. But seeing the park with my own eyes, I feel that these allegations are the furthest thing from the truth. The animals seem well cared and seem to participate in the shows with enthusiasm. I wish I showed up to work with such enthusiasm ;-)"
468,12/27/2017,3,"I miss the old SeaWorld.Don't get me wrong, its still fun and its always awesome to see all the animals but a LOT has changed from when I was a kid. From what i could remember, Seaworld was all about putting the spot light on the animals and learning about them. Now they have rollercoasters, carnival games and a giant jungle gym area where kids can climb ropes and hang from swings. They've also added more interactive areas where you can pet small sharks and have little sucker fish clean your hands which I liked but overall I think the focus is more on rides and games instead of the animals and education."
469,4/26/2016,3,"After watching the documentary I was really adamant about not going anymore, but I couldn't pass up the Black Friday deal. Buy one adult annual pass and get one free. Honestly where else can you go to see all these sea animals in one place? I used to go to this park all the time as a kid. As an adult it's just not the same. Due to the drought some of the exhibits are closed (ie the winter snow exhibit). If you aren't watching any of the shows you can walk the whole park in about an hour or so if you don't really stop by the exhibits for too long.Be sure to show your membership pass for discounts on food and merchandise."
470,9/5/2016,4,"I've only been here a couple of times but I do like this place cause I love dolphins and whales. In the years this place has become more than just another animal or in this case mammal park, this has become more of an amusement park with a few rides, games, exhibits, and of course food. There are things to see for all ages. You not only have rides but also rides and play area for the kids where little ones can run around and play and get tired out for the parents lol. Overall a great place to bring the family to have fun and gain more knowledge on our sea mammals."
471,4/9/2018,3,"We went to Seaworld and it was okay. It's a little expensive for what you get. The shows were pretty good and there is a petting area in the beginning that's pretty cool because they have the little fish that eat your dead skin, and they have sharks and sting rays. The rest of the stuff I feel like you could see at a good aquarium. They have to start getting newer shows or more animals or make the admission cheaper."
472,3/3/2015,5,"SeaWorld is still one of the most amazing and entertaining places to visit for viewing sea creatures and learning about the world of the ocean. Â They also have some awesome animal exhibits that you can't find anywhere else. Â Where else can you see penguins, a polar bear, and a giant 900+ pound walrus right next to each other? It is like an amusement park built around several awesome aquariums, with some really fantastic other animals as well. Many of the exhibits you find in modern aquariums are based on things that SeaWorld invented or started. As you go through you realize that SeaWorld really is the best at what it does. For example, right when you enter they have a tank where you can place your hand in the water, and dozens of tiny fish will nibble away at you. Â It doesn't hurt at all and is rather amazing, to big and little kids alike. Â The fish aren't hard to see, and they interact with you right away.You can also feed giant manta rays with fish, and pet them as they come up to get the food. Â There are some huge ones in the tank and it's pretty awesome (or intimidating) to have them swim up and have them grab the fish right out of your hand. You can also feed sea lions who will catch fish that you throw out of mid air, and will yell at you for more - just a few feet away.Of course, there are also the four main shows with dolphins, killer whales, sea lions, and household pets. They have done an excellent job making each of these shows lively, hilarious, and entertaining. Â Even though the trainers can no longer get in the water with the killer whales, the show is still great - you can sit within just a few feet of a huge whale that jumps out of the water right in front of you.Despite all of the negative PR, SeaWorld also has an active marine animal rescue program and has rescued thousands of animals. Â They've done a huge amount of good for sea life and educating the public about the ocean. Â SeaWorld is definitely worth the visit and you are likely to have a really good time."
473,6/22/2018,1,"Boy hire fake reviewers much??? I am giving this place one star So that they don't completely lose their minds and further abuse Â the animals. Much Â like everyone else after seeing blackfish I had no desire to come here But it was on my young sons bucket list. After standing at the orca tank for 30 minutes pretty much bawling my eyes out, Other than doing the same thing at the dolphin tank what else is there to do But go on a few rides well OK then go ahead and try to do that. Guess what you have to rent a stupid locker just in order to go on one I see you Sea World Trying to recoup some of the money you lost due to Blackfish . Do the right thing & release these whales NOW, people will still come for the other offerings at the park...."
474,9/16/2015,5,"Went on a military pass with the family. Â Our son had a wonderful time. Â His favorite was getting to pet the small sharks just within the entrance to Sea World. Â All the information and demonstrations by the Killer Whales were amazing and informative. Â I am not a theorist but I do appreciate the sharing of information that Sea World tries to put out. Â We do need to be better informed.We didn't get to stay long, just long enough. Â We look forward to bringing Joaquin when he is much older and able to grasp more of what he has available."
475,10/5/2016,2,"We. waited all day and Â paid $550 one adult and one child to supposed to be private swimming with the dolphin ,and then we end up with a bunch of other people 20 minutes in the pool ,standing by wall, just watching and Â listening stories from the trainer..... dolphin was too young and she's still learning the tricks, hardly touching her.....10sec.of swimming Â on her back and that's it completely rip offBut we made beautiful pictures and I guess those pictures worth that money.....:-)"
476,12/31/2017,5,We had a great time visiting Sea World during the Christmas/New Years time. Prices are very reasonable for the year and we got year passes. Parking was excellent as well. Kids had fun playing and climbing in fun zone. Truly something for everyone including the Christmas nativity themes that I saw kudos to Seaworld. Toys and food were reasonably priced and bathrooms weee clean. Very impressed and will continue to visit here for years to come.
477,4/5/2018,5,"Seaworld is awesome! Free for military plus 4 guests per year, I love how much they support not only the aquatic life and try to spread awareness, but they also support military and that's just awesome! Came here about a month too early for their new electric eel ride that looks terrifyingly awesome, will have to come back and try it out. Came here during a food tasting event around the park, such a good addition to experiencing everything, and their shows are spaced enough for you to hit them all."
478,9/25/2015,5,"I love Seaworld and have since I was brought when I was a toddler. Â Now I bring my son who loves sea life. Â Seaworld gives him the chance to learn about the animals and even interact with some like the bamboo sharks, horseshoe crabs, starfish, and cleaner fish. Â I love the additon at the front where you pet the sharks. Â It is an awesome experience and has only made my son love them more. Â I love watching the orcas and dolphins they are two of my favorite animals. Â If you get a season pass they offer deals throughout the year like tickets for a guest or items like a freezer bag or souvenir cup. Â I also like they offer easy pay on the passes, it makes it much more affordable for a family. Â We like to come often and we are able to stay just a couple hours and leave. Â It's a nice outing for my son."
479,8/9/2018,2,Came with my family the animal attractions were pretty nice to see. The price of the tickets weren't too bad 40 bucks a person parking was overpriced $22. They have the worst customer service the employee don't care about the people or making them feel special. When searching for the refillable cups cups at a stand the employees said they had run out but were getting some yet so one moved or called anyone just returned to their conversation After finally buying the cup went to two drinks stands both had broken soda. The few rides it has all of them were broken down had to wait for Maintence to have them up and running. Doubt I will be back
480,8/7/2018,2,Orca show and dolphins are the only highlight to this place as far as animals go. The rest seem to be living sad lives. I have two 4 year olds and one 5 year old and they were miserable.
481,10/26/2018,5,"Pleasantly surprised. Had a great day at Sea World. Â We got free tickets because my hubby's a veteran ( thank you). Â We loved seeing the sharks, penguins and the sea lion show. We can't wait to come back!"
482,9/12/2016,4,"SeaWorld is a great place to bring small children, as they will get to see and interact with these beautiful animals up close. Â For those of you who have seen Blackfish, you will note that this generation of beautiful orcas will be the last at SeaWorld. Â They have stopped their Orca breeding program, which is a great step in the right direction. Â Ok, I'll step off my soapbox now:-Breakfast with Shamu: This was a really fun activity as we got to see the orcas up close. Â The food itself wasn't bad, and there was a decent variety. Â The server was super friendly and awesome and ran around taking pictures for everyone. Â Its obvious how much the trainers love the animals; they constantly fed them, petted them and gave them balls of ice as treats while asking them to perform a few tricks. Â They mostly let the orcas play around and didn't subject them to that many behaviors. Â The kids were all spellbound, its a great show. Â They also addressed some ""myths"" from Blackfish, which I thought was interesting. Â No splashes and reserve online ahead of time!-The Park: SeaWorld consists of a lot of stadiums with timed shows, interactions and some rides. Â The shows are all great, the best being the Shamu show, dolphins and the pets one. Â You can also feed sea otters which was really fun! Â The Arctic Wild section had a walk through (if you have tots) or a ride, you get to see beluga whales and polar bears.All in all, a great place to bring your kids and learn about marine life! The park is huuuge so bring your walking shoes! *TIP* Â purchase the ""Play & Dine Bundle"" Â which is admission + Eat Free All Day for $89 to save money! The food is quite expensive there."
483,11/16/2018,1,"Sooo bummed to write a poor review for SeaWorld...a place that we would typically love! Â I am writing this specifically for the Christmas members only event on 11/16/2018. Â I drove a 1.5 hours each way with my 3 + 5 year old boys to see the fantastic Christmas celebration, Santa, real reindeer, falling snow, costumed characters roaming around the park and we saw NONE OF IT. Â We only say trees decorated with Christmas lights, some other minimal decorations and holiday items for sale in the gift shops.We went to SeaWorld for halloween and it was a blast! Â Spooktacular dance floor, characters, trick or treating, singing pumpkins, Dia de los Muertos decorations, etc., etc. Â We thought the Christmas event would be just as fantastic. Â The official website shows all kinds of activities, shows and costumed elves + reindeer. Â Further disappointment because we had planned to take visiting family members in December, but will now make other plans."
484,10/28/2018,1,Just found out you are forced to rent a locker for manta and electric eel rides if you have bag other than a seaworld bag.The attendees were rude.It should be customer's choice if they want to safeguard their belongings. Â  Disney and Knottsberry Â farm Â don't force you to rent a locker.It's another way for seaworld to try to get more money from their annual members to make for their continue loses
485,4/15/2019,3,"First visit to San Diego as a family. We're from the east coast and have been to the Orlando park many times. This one is ok. It's kind of run down and the food options are not great. What they do have is extremely expensive for what you get. The rides and show feel dated. Even the trainers seemed a bit bored. Â But, we had fun so that's what counts."
486,4/18/2019,1,"Horrible. Free preschool pass, But then you have to wait over an hour on a busy day (with an impatient preschooler!) just to redeem it because you have to show a birth certificate. Meanwhile, the teacher passes can be printed out at a kiosk. Why not have a few people at the kiosk checking for birth certificates so that you can print out the preschool passes too? Give a few employees a code that they can type into the kiosk to OK the preschool passes. Or at least have every single one of your stations open on a busy day. Understaffed, and it's a nightmare."
487,4/29/2018,5,We just bought annual passes because the deal was too good to pass up (includes free parking too!). Our 2 year old LOVES the attractions they offer for the little ones. The bounce pad of Sesame Street is really cool - it's like a big gentle trampoline with lots of colorful soft blocks for the young kids to run around and play with each other. They also have a handful of rides that are perfect for her age. And the playground structure at Sesame Street is great for all the kids (lots of older kids but our 2 year old was squealing with joy running around too). We're looking forward to the Sesame Street parade that starts in May. Sea World is a great spot to bring young kids to play!
488,10/21/2018,4,SeaWorld is one of my favorite places. We got annual passes for the theme park today. I never have complaints with SeaWorld. All the shows are fantastic. The employees are so knowledgeable and always willing to answer any questions. Glad to see they have added roller coasters. The kids loved going on the few that they had. It's October to the truck or treaters are out. I do think they need to organize that a little better. The kids are everywhere in lines for candy and it gets irritating. The food hasn't improved much. Other then that it's a great place. Kids have fun. Great family time.
489,8/4/2016,4,"Come during week days to avoid more crowding..Forgot how FUN the dolphin & killer whales shows are!General tickets $89 each, preorder online & print in advance for discount.General parking $17."
490,8/15/2018,1,"This is the worst place ever, at first they charge you $10 more for up close parking when the regular parking is just a few more stalls back so I guess that was my bad but when you come to eat at the bbq place here it was a terrible experience now for the customer service the counter help was not helpful at all and when we asked for the manager and I explained what the issue was with the counter person she just laughed and shrugged her shoulders as if she didn't care, never again will I come to sea world and spend my hard earned money here it's not worth it and calypso bay smoke house don't get the bbq chicken it was dried out and the brisket they gave was all fat no meat. If I could give it no stars I would but yelp doesn't provide that."
491,1/10/2015,5,"First I like to say PETA kiss my Mexican Irish nalgas! Me & the family love this place! We have year passes & come bout 15 times a year! I actually propose to my wife here. We love all the rides & shows! My favorite thing to do here is eat a turkey leg it taste great & I love the Manta ride, one of the best rides I've been on anywhere! And of course I love saying hi to Shamu/orcas. The staff here are always friendly & helpful & try Dinning with Shamu, it's a great experience & good food.OH & I LOVE DRIVING BY THE PROTESTERS SLOWLY SHOWING THEM MY YEAR PASS IN ONE HAND & FLIPPING THEM OFF WITH MY OTHER HAND AS I DRIVE PASS SLOWLY SMILING! See you soon Sea World & friends!"
492,8/31/2018,3,"Do not buy the All-Day Dining Deal. Really, really not worth eating anywhere in the park. They are very poorly prepared. At Flatbreads and Fry Cones there are 2 windows open and only 14 people in line. It's bee 25 minutes and they've served 3 people. I'm sticking it out to see exactly how long it takes. (5 people left, they couldn't take it anymore) After being able to use the pass for one eatery we gave up. I went to customer service and they did make it right. Since your band is scanned I'm sure they saw we didn't use it. They even gave some credit to use elsewhere in the park. I was happy in the end. Thank you customer service. p.s. Still would not recommend the pass. Every eatery had at least a 30-60 minute wait."
493,12/23/2014,4,"My girlfriend and I have been on an adventure in 2014. We've been on many outdoor thrills as Adventurists, but we've been known more to be as Theme Park Enthusiasts. I have my parks that I go to and she has her parks that she goes to. I've taken her to one park, we've both go to the same theme park, but it's her turn to take me to her second favorite theme park, SeaWorld.With all the news about SeaWorld, that won't ruin my view about my experience. SeaWorld is unique. It's a combination of a zoo and theme park. Although, SeaWorld is heavily reliant on shows with both land and sea animals, this is a chemistry that most park don't tend to combine. SeaWorld is in San Diego and is a perfect spot since Los Angeles and Orange County can't really put a park of this unique attribute in.SeaWorld offers unique passes: 2-Year Passes. I am used to having 1-Year Passes, but I like the offer. You can pay all at once or pay in monthly installments which is pretty cheap. Why get a day admission when two visits basically pay itself?! Parking is abut $16, but if you get one of the Membership Passes, you will be guaranteed parking even if its for three free months. If you purchase your tickets online, you can redeem your tickets at the ticket admission counter or use the automatic kiosk. The downside of the Membership pass is that the pass is not plastic. It's made of paper and can easily tear. You can get a pass sleeve to protect it.SeaWorld is known for their shows. You can catch SeaWorld's popular Shamu show. It has changed over the years, but the Killer Orca's are the main attraction. If killer whales aren't your thing, head over to Pet's Rule. Catch some birds, cats, dogs, and other animals do some wonderful tricks. Not into shows, there are a couple of rides that will fill your adrenaline. Ride Manta! Its a thrilling rollercoaster that speeds through the track with some cool video at the beginning of the ride. OK, what about a classic that I've ridden since I was little kid. BaySide Skyride. Like the other Yelpers who wrote about Bayside Skyride, ITS A MUST!Now, if those don't satisfy your thrill, get close to sharks and pet them. Yes, pet them. However, I don't touch fish. I haven't gotten used to feeling them. Oh yeah, SHARKS! Go to the Shark Encounter and get close and personal. These sharks are huge and their teeth are as dangerous. Maybe you don't want to get near these sharks. How about the many various fishes and turtles?! Turtles may be slow on land, but they sure are fast under water. Feed a couple of other creatures in their areas.Of course, you have to get near a Flamingo!As I mentioned, SeaWorld is a very unique amusement park. It may not compete against the big guns, but it sure does get the segment of the market that loves to see sea creatures that we wouldn't see in the ocean. Everyone one of us would want some animal in our backyard. You have to admit that! Now, I have yet to see a Standing Shamu take photos with us. On my next visit, if I see Shamu taking a photo and standing next to me....I will be in shock. As much as I love standing next to a mouse, dog, and birds, I want to take a photo with a smiling Orca.You think I write too much? Well, you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!"
494,9/7/2017,5,I was dreading my visit here! I didn't want to see poor little (big) ocean life locked in boring white pools singing sad songs in sonar. Wow! I am so glad that I went. This place is AMAZING! Their love for the animals is evident in every detail and in the voice of every employee that educates you on the animals. We only got to see one show and I was so disappointed. We saw the evening show and it was above and beyond fabulous. There was plenty to amuse the kids while also incorporating adult funnies. I highly recommend it. I just can't say enough about the amazing exhibits. The narwhal and the ice wall was just over the top. I loved seeing the sea lions and watching the dolphins frolic was delightful.Since we came so late in the day we missed quite a bit but we will definitely be back. There are a ton of wonderful things to see and do. I highly recommend spending some time here!!
495,3/14/2019,1,Gates to the park open at 10. Gates from the entry area open at 10:40. Rides don't open until 11 or 12. Park closes at 5. Â Wish I knew that before hand.. what a rip off!!!
496,9/13/2017,5,"I haven't been here since the documentary. I was hesitant. But then I had grandkids get to an age. And I began to wonder how they would develop a love for sea life and ocean health if they had never seen an orca or a dolphin close up. That's where I fell in love with these animals and grew a desire to protect them. The aquariums and orcas and dolphins were a big hit. I could tell a lot of changes have and are being made. It's also clear the park has taken a big financial hit, and some of the shops and attractions were closed or more limited in viewing. But that's to be expected give the circumstances, and I was sad to see rather than upset with my experience.Watching the kiddos see a dolphin and a whale for a first time was magical. Every staff member we met was nice, kind, friendly and helpful. Period. Lunch with the Orcas cannot be overstated. It was yummy, shady, calm, interesting, leisurely and a needed break in the day. I'd do it again and every trip. No doubt. I bought a 2 year pass and will buy passes for my grandkids when they need them. My one request is that they put books and educational materials in the gift shop. If we hope to educate our next generation on conservation, sea life, ecosystems and ocean health we need to start here. I appreciate and applaud the efforts made by Sea World, hope to see them on the cutting edgy in the future and will support them as long as they continue."
497,7/7/2018,5,I'm a native san diegan and I love sea world . We recently bought passes and it's a wonderful investment . We have zoo passes and new children's muesuem passes as well but My 3 year old toddler loves this place the best and it's the perfect place for him with its Sesame Street bay of play and rides that are perfect for him. They also have beautiful displays for their aquatic life and wonderful shows . They've changed a lot in their shows but it's all very positive and I still think it's a beautiful park. I'm lucky to live sooo close to sea world because I can use the pass to entertain my toddler and grab a craft beer at the same time.
498,8/25/2018,1,You would be better off just watching National Geographic if you want any kind of animal experience. Sea World has become an absolute hands off / look but don't attempt to interact in any way facility. I miss the days when you could pet a dolphin without having to pay an extra fee.
499,7/24/2019,1,"I purchased an annual pass. Â What a disappointment. Had not been to SeaWorld in 3 years -- what a decline. Many of the exhibits are dirty and the pools are rusted and appear to be not conducive to the animals they proclaim to care so much about. The children's area is tired looking and almost carnivalesque. Â The staff are, in most instances, very young, rude and, obviously, haggard as there doesn't appear to be enough of them. Â When getting out of the dolphin show, we went over to the area that had drinks, etc. Â The expectation, it appears from Management, was to get drinks, etc. and then pay at another area. Â The place was packed. . . two very long lines and one, not so competent, staffperson. Â The lines were ridiculously long and many folks just got their slurppy or whatever and walked off. In the preying mantis exhibit (horribly run down and rusted pools), we waited for 5 minutes to get assistance in purchasing merchandise. Â The landscaping was not of its past glory nor was the vibe of the entire place. Â Really sad to see such decline in a supposed San Diego attraction. Â This place needs an overhaul, new management, and better trained staff. I will not be purchasing another annual pass. In my opinion, it is not worth the price. Â Even for out of town visitors, I would go elsewhere -- Scripps Aquarium is much better for viewing sea creatures, albeit no rides for the kids, etc."
500,2/28/2018,1,There are way too many unfenced sections that are next to water where kids can fall in and drown!!! Fix it now!!!! My niece fell in and got wet.
501,10/31/2018,5,"On Monday October 29,2018 me and my family went to visit sea world san Diego for we have been pass holders for the past two years or more. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!! My son was hurt on one of the kiddie rides (my son is 4 years old) due to the lack of observation of the ride operator for they don't pay attention and really don't care the ride operators have no enthusiasm, or make the ride fun they never talk to the kids and let alone don't pay attention that's the least they can do right .......I believe your amusement park should call back the family the first 24-48 hours just to make sure the child is ok but nope that ain't happening but you guys do a good job taking my money every month and us as dummies buying your over priced items and food I really thought you all were different boy was I mistaken so after being pass holders for so long they will be cancelled and we will find somewhere else to go that will show they care even if they don't but at least a call an email something or well we were there here is five dollars take your kid to buy an ice cream after all we failed to.hire the right people but nope you guys gave him stickers that no longer exist because they say shamu thought you guys call them orcas know work on your team and hopefully for the next family you guys will do better"
502,2/13/2015,4,"Seaworld has always been really enjoyable for me as a kid and also now as an adult. My dad, little sister and I purchased the annual pass and it's definitely worth it. I admit the shows do get boring sometimes because it's the same thing over and over again. But I always love seeing the Cirque De Soleil show! That's my favorite show of all! They're all so talented and the show gives us a good laugh. The penguin encounter is my sister's favorite. You walk in the encounter and there are hundreds of penguins just chilling in the icy water. Most of the encounters at sea world accommodates to the animals' natural habitat. I love the fact that we get to experience and actually see the sea life that we usually do not get to see in our oceans. My family and I came on the weekend of Lunar New Year so everything was decorated in pretty lanterns. They even gave us a $10 off coupon for the dolphin experience. I like the fact that they introduced everyone to another culture. They even had a show that had Chinese acrobats performing, Vietnamese Lion Dancing and a Korean performance. They touched on different countries of Asia (not just China). It was amazing to see people of different cultures dance and perform for their New Year celebration. The only con I would say is that food and material items are very pricey. But then again, what amusement doesn't overprice their stuff? :/ However, they have been really generous about their ticketing pricing (probably because they want their guests to come back). Annual tickets are fairly cheap."
503,4/9/2015,4,"In the past few years, Seaworld has had faced a lot of bad publicity and I could tell with the scarcity of cars in the parking lot. It was a bit weird for me at first to be at an amusement park and it not being packed however I got used to it. No waiting in lines for rides and getting pretty decent seats for the shows. The only one show that I had to return back for a later show because of limited seats was the dolphin show. Â A lot of the restaurants and stores were closed also.1 think that kind of irked me was after I rode the Manta ride, I asked if we could just cut through the front of the line to go stand at the back, and the girl told us that we had to go and exit and go all the way around. Oh, and there were only about 10 people in line. There are employees that roam around asking questions about wildlife and give out prizes! We got free tickets to feed the seals and the stingrays. Feeding the sting rays was kind of cool. It was a new experience. You place the food in between your fingers and you submerge your arm to the bottom of the aquarium (for lack of a better word), and the sting rays come and eat it out of your hand. They also gave out dvds as prizes."
504,4/15/2019,2,"They force you to get a locker when riding manta ray no matter how small your purse is, and then they charge you $1 an hour for it!!! So if you're there on a busy day, you'd have to pay more. How greedy do they have to be to charge you $1?!?! Universal Studios gives you free lockers when they force you to store your belongings, Sea World should do the same!"
505,7/12/2016,4,"SeaWorld, I'm impressed. I hadn't been to a SeaWorld since I was a kid, but I jumped at the opportunity when I realized how close we were to the one in San Diego.As far as rides, we only got on the observation deck while there, but we did see absolutely every exhibit and it took just about the whole day. It's amazing how interactive many exhibits were. We pet sting rays, fed barking sea lions (still voting for the name to be changed to ""sea dogs"" or ""sea canines""), and got splashed by dolphins. The shows were truly amazing and pretty informative. One thing that really stood out to me was that some of the trainers during the show even talked about how they became interested in working with the animals at SeaWorld.The indoor aquariums seemed a little small with incredibly long lines and it kind of shuffled you through before you could really take it all in. Literature was pretty rare, but I still enjoyed them.I'd love to go again and I think next time we'll try to get on the rides too. I did find out that if you're going during the week, their online price is better than their at the door price so keep that in mind. All in all, it was a great day!"
506,3/31/2018,4,"I had fun, but felt guilty. I was really glad to see that they changed the Orca program and no longer have the orcas doing a bunch of tricks. However, I feel horrible for the orcas, and large animals that are unable to swim around and be free. The shows are cute. The rides were fun for the kids. The Sesame Street area was a big hit with my 7 and 3 year olds. We were kept busy all day there. We went from open to close 10-7. We did leave for lunch though. We were going to pay extra to park up close but ended up paying for normal parking. I am glad we saved the extra bit of money because we only had to walk a few rows extra."
507,8/23/2018,2,We have been passholders since 2012 and this is the last year we are for sure! We already been paying more than enough considering we dont even come here to often. Its ridiculous that now we have to pay an extra $5 per person to ride the bayside skyride and the skytower. I dont recommend SeaWorld anymore.
508,8/28/2016,1,"First of all, I have to say I love all of animals here that's why I come here every year . But I will never come back again.  Â The reason why is because their security has big problem. I came here on 8/11. my 2 yrs baby and me was hit by a group of people, the security came after 10 minutes. I hurt a lot, back, neck, foots. So They suggest me to see doctor. Cause it happens on 4:30. So I went to doctor office next day. The medical report shows I get many bruise on my body. X-rays shows my neck get hurt. So I trying to contact them. However,They never answer my call and refuse to reply my email.  Â We came here for fun, but we just get nightmares from here. My baby crying whole night for one week. And really get hurt from here."
509,1/5/2015,4,"Spent a few days at SeaWorld during the holidays. I was here as a kid, but don't remember much, so I am counting this as my first time. There is several things to do here. They have several rides through-out the park, mostly water rides. The ""Manta"" ride would have to be my favorite. Its a short ride, but its fun and fast. I was here for two days but still didn't see everything. I believe there is things for small children to do. Most of the rides in the park; small children cannot go on. They have games though i know that.There is many places to eat in the park and lots of small shacks for snacks. Of course like every park, food and drinks is a little pricey, but good. We ate at Shipwreck a few times. Very good food, and prices are pretty fair. The wild arctic museum is cool to see. There is even a Polar Bear. The penguin habitat is nice too. They have dozens of species, but you have to see them from behind glass walls. Outside however, there is a handful of penguins you can see up close. We came when they had lots of christmas show specials. We also got to play in the snow, which was pretty cool. We saw the shamu Show during the day(most shows are about 20-30 minutes) and the christmas shamu show at night. It was really nice. They had a women sing for us along with a choir. we also saw the dolphin and otter show which I really enjoyed. You got sting rays you can touch as well by the Manta ride. There is some sharks in there too. The customer service is hard to review at a park, but I did notice a lot of employees seemed to be a little confused on where things were in the park. I always felt lost when I was there.."
510,9/25/2017,1,"Park was dirty, there was trash everywhere. The water of the dolphin arena was DISGUSTING and bright green!!!"
511,4/19/2018,5,"The Pet Show was cute-didn't expect to see it at Sea World-fun for kids. During some of the shows and rides, you may get wet. Fun time!"
512,8/19/2018,2,"I visited Seaworld Aug 15, 2018, and experienced NUMEROUS problems. 1) BLARINGLY LOUD horrible radio ""music""; so loud that even with my earplugs, I found that I would also need to wear sound protectors! / Certainly this was also bothering the highly intelligent killer whales & dolphins ! 2) The water in the underwater viewing area for the killer whales was so horribly filled with debris (because the pool water not adequately filtered) that you really cannot take a decent photo ! I really feel sorry for the killer whales. 3) Maps not even made avaiable !!!4) It was hard to navigate OUT of Seaworld when I was finished. I had to search for Seaworld employees to ask them where the exit/entrance is located. There SHOULD have been cleared posted SIGNS for the exit/entrance. ----HOWEVER: Where else can one go to see see the wonderful dolphins or killer whales at all?"
513,7/28/2018,3,"The dolphin show is great. The Atlantis ride is a gem because it's just scary enough for 5+ year olds. The Beluga whales are exotic. However, much of the park is forgettable or dated (to the 1980s to be exact). Bottom line, nowadays, there are better versions of both animal experiences and thrill rides."
514,11/6/2017,1,"Seaworld Sleepoverseaworld.com/san-diego/eâ€¦Please click above for the exact sleep over. Â Save your money . Â Do not do the sleepover. Â The sleepover was extremely disappointing. Â I think if expectations were set ahead of time we all would of been fine but they do not let you know anything ahead of time because you Â most likely would not sign up. Â  Â I was ready to sleep on the floor with my child under the aquarium but the things they do no tell you is what is not Ok, Â Expectation need to be set.We arrived and were placed with 2 other groups of Girl Scouts that we did not know. Â  Â The staff reads each name off for the name tags one by one so you have to wait through 2 other groups for your name. Â Takes way to long. Â A Suggestion is to Divide up the groups and disperse the name tags and the expectation should be set that you will be sleeping in the same room with people you don't know.Then Â they take your stuff from you and load it on a tram. Â So you have none of your stuff and if you put your pillow on top of your stuff it is shoved in a tram with everyone else's stuff loose. Â  (gross in my opinion) Â My daughter's pillow was lost in the process. Â They throw it in there and sometimes put your stuff in separate trams so its harder to track down, Â All your stuff should be put in one compartment not a completely separate compartment.They should let you know to label and put your pillow and anything else in a plastic bag labeled and that your stuff will be separated from you the majority of the time.Here is a sample of schedule5:45 PM ......................... Arrival and check-in 6:30 - 9:45 PM ............... Dinner and educational activities 10:30 PM - midnight*........Bedtime 6:30 AM - park open ........Wake-up, pack-up and breakfast Park opens ......................Play all day at SeaWorld!As you walk through Â the park which is empty the counselors are so concerned about hurrying you through to meet there scheduling time that you are not allowed to linger to even look at the animals or appreciate where you are! Â This to me was extremely disappointing I am not a kid there at camp I am a grown adult who paid for an experience with my daughter. Â The counselors need to watch how they speak to the children and especially adults. Â I did not feel like a paid guest. Â  Â Dinner the food was adequate but not fresh.The most disappointing of all is that all the tanks are dark and you Â cannot see any fish. Â  Â I thought we would be sleeping somewhere where we could see the aquarium. Â Instead you go in and it pitch black. Â  Â This should be explained ahead of time!!!!!!The educational activities were fine but not being able to see any animals had me wondering why are we here?The other huge factor was the bathroom situation. Â This made the trip border line gross to me.Since they group you with 2 other groups they tell you that they need to take you to a bigger bathroom in the park . Â Your completely rushed to get your stuff to change in the bathroom for both bedtime and to start your day after the sleep over, Â  Â There are no mirrors. Â You brush your teeth where millions of people have washed their hands. Â  Â Kids were not told to bring a small bag Â and I picked up multiple clothing items b/c they were dropping them on the 5-10 min walk to the bathroom. Â When you arrive in the bathroom the counselors tell you to hurry up the whole time. Â  Â I could barely brush my hair in the morning. Â I find this ridiculous!!! Â At night if you have to go to the bathroom you have to wake up a camp counselor , so strange. Â Bedtime was also kinda sudden and we were told all electronics need to be off and that we needed to go to bed. Â Spoken to like children. Â The next day we are told we will not get coffee until 2.5 hours after we wake up and to not ask for it. Â We had to walk completely across the park walking by coffee places that were open and we were told we could not stop. Â  Â When we finally arrived for our 8:30 am snack that we walked across the park for we were given a nutri grain bar. Â The snacks were terrible and need to be re done. Â The fruit roll up served at 9 at night I do not allow my daughter to eat period. Â  Â It's not hard to make kids snacks special.I would skip the sleepover and only attend the Breakfast with the Orcas wich was an amazing experience."
515,1/4/2019,3,"I had high hopes for SeaWorld despite a lot of the backlash the park has received of late. Â While the animal exhibits and shows were alright, the park just felt sad. Â The place needs a facelift, feels dated- particularly the restaurants. Â Food was pretty terrible, we tried 4 of the all day dining places and they were all not great. Â Need to have healthier, fresher options, get with the times! Â Many of the kiosks were also closed, which felt desolate. The O wondrous night show for Christmas was about the birth of Jesus, which I get you don't need to attend if you aren't religious, but wouldn't they want to have a more neutral show to appeal to a broader audience? Â Seriously glad I didn't pay full price. Â Here's a tip- get on their email list and you can get a buy one get one free ticket offer during Black Friday."
516,7/23/2018,4,"Being a native - I've grown up going to Sea World. I remember to old shows and how it has progressed. Â The park has many great attributes. You will be able to see different shows with marine and land mammals. There are rides - they just opened Electric Eel May 2018 primarily to boost attendance with some more fun factor. Â  If you live in the area - get an annual pass - worth the money - save on parking, you can come for just a show or two visit your favorite creatures (mine are the orcas and the rays), Â and not fight crowds so much. Â  Notes - yes, rides will break down....they do at Disneyland, Universal and Magic Mountain too - trust me. Â  Lines can get long - especially in peak times - come on, think about it that's why they have to put the time on the outside. Â  Â  Parking cost - it sucks, but yes - all the other parks charge (except Zoo, but Safari Park does). Â Selling merchandise and costs in park - no kidding - that's what they all do!!! Â  Â Take your refillable water bottles in(yes they have places you can fill them), and healthy snacks. Â We do SW, Disney and Zoo - they all try to get you on food and merchandise - it's up to you to fall for it Remember- despite all the noise/rumors many have heard but don't really know - Sea World has saved thousands of animals. They give us a place to see some great marine mammals and fish and yes, it is becoming a theme park, but there is much good Â  Pros - good shows, all kinds of seasonal events (food one and summer electric ocean are best), rides, petting rays, sea otters, little kid play area, near the bay - cool and breezy Cons - due to the bad press, smaller crowds , etc. you can tell there is some needed maintenance- shark exhibit ceiling, oh and the new VR ""experience "" is not worth your time, let alone your money."
517,4/13/2018,5,"Where else can you:Contribute to the rescue and research of sea life, both animals and plants?While you:Watch Beluga whales play and feed from up above and below? Â Certainly not even on an Alaskan cruise, could you get under the water and watch them play. Â Because of Sea World, I love Beluga Whales, and before I could care less about them.See a pod of dolphins and pilot whales play?Watch Manta Rays swim overhead and then go up top and pet them?See incredibly giant sea turtles and tons of them?Touch horseshoe crabs and have fish eat the dead skin off of your hands?Eat delicious treats without breaking the bank?Get a birds eye view of the San Diego bay? Â You get to see it from the gondolas that go over the water, and the tall tower that you can see from the 5 freeway.Cool off from the hot sun by being soaked by fun rides or fun shows.I love the shows. Â I see the animals and they are like people who love to perform. Â You can tell when they're having fun and I like that there are limited amounts of shows. Â The shows have helped me to appreciate the animals and their personalities over the years. Â I really love the trainers too.Some have been there for 20 years!I love their annual events, especially the Christmas event and the new behind the scenes. Â I am currently enjoying the 7 Seas event too!Get an annual pass, it's only $10 a month and you get free parking."
518,2/21/2019,1,Don't buy a season pass! Â I bought a pass that was supposed to come with guest passes. When I inquired about the passes they told me that they'd be emailed to me. I never received them so I called customer service and they told me one had already expired and the other one would be emailed to me. Yeah right! Â I never got the first one! Â They're running a scam.
519,8/6/2018,4,"Wonderful place to cool off , relax , and be educated and entertained. Â Awesome summer night shows and epic rollercoaster rides. Why not 5 stars??? One word: maintenance. Â There's areas that dont get properly maintained. Â Shipwreck Rapids Â cannons ( water jets) are consistently out of service or poorly working. The money changer is broken every time I visit and it's like pulling teeth Â to get quarters from staff. You have a great place Otherwise. Â Terrific shows, Â wonderful performances and generous, Â caring staff. Please work on your maintenance Â ."
520,12/15/2017,5,"It's been a great of both my husband and myself to go to Seaworld since we were kids. We finally go to do that! First off I want to start off by saying THANK YOU to Waves of Honor for the free tickets. My husband is active duty military and they offer AD +3 dependents free tickets. I'm not sure we would have gone had this not been available. We got there 2 minutes before it opened on a Monday. The parking lot was nearly empty which was cool. As we were walking in we heard the national anthem. The lady at the entrance scanned our tickets and we were in; simple. I had so much fun petting and touching the sharks, crabs, and sucker fish when you first entered. Husband and I joked we need a tank of those sucker fish at home. Seeing the Orcas was next and we really enjoyed them. I'm not getting into documentaries or politics here. Just stating I enjoyed it. They were playing around and it made us so happy to watch them. Â Next on the list was dolphins. I'm not sure how but we seemed to time walking around the park perfect because we caught every show that day. (except the nativity show because 1: I know the story and 2: I left before it started). I was sad I didn't get to pet the dolphins and they have options were you can pay to spend time with them. $65 for petting/photos where you stay at the side of the tank or $215 where you suit up and get into the water. I considered it but I'm too cheap for that (and embarrassed to be in a wet suit in front of people!) We ended up coming back later to the 4pm show and I DID get to pet the dolphins which completed my day. We saw the seals, the otters, the penguins, and so much more. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the shark zone; just so boring. Out of all the shows the dolphins were hands down the best. We sat in the splash zone and it holds true to its name. Wasn't the smartest thing either since we got coated in salty COLD water. We ended up leaving earlier because of it but we DID see all of the park that was open. I can be easily done in one day. Oh and the Journy to Atlantis ride is EVIL and I was NOT PREPARED for that at all. I saw an innocent log ride type thing... yeah no. LOL I screamed my head off. My husband goes ""they're going to drop us in the dark"" WHAT?!! I won't spoil it but uh... it gets scary after the water drop you see. My husband really enjoyed the bayside skyride and the skytower (I nicknamed the spinning blue vomit tower because I felt ill). The weirdest thing was probably petting a manta ray. Slimy and bizarre but still awesome.To wrap it up I highly recommend SeaWorld. As two adults (no kids) we had a blast. I don't know if I'd go back since you can do it all in one day but if I had kids I'd probably but the annual pass."
521,7/5/2019,2,"They know how to squeeze every possible dollar out of you, that's for sure. As expected with any amusement park or whatever this is considered. I'm fine with it when I feel like I get a decent return on my money. This place needs to get things together; it seemed like they run on the lowest amount of staff possible, lines for everything (food/rides/any & everything) move extremely slow. The 'Quick Queue' is a complete rip off that isn't run correctly or efficiently at all. Staff should be at the front of ALL lines to ensure everyone coming through the 'Quick Queue' line in fact has one and also knows where to go. It's basically like ""walk I. The normal entrance and have everybody in line get pissed because they think you're just cutting the line. All concession stands could use more staffing. Â Charging for lockers when not providing a simple cubby hole?? The animals are cool and all but this was my family's first visit to any SeaWorld and definitely our last."
522,12/19/2014,5,"SEAWORLD! I LOVE YOU!My heart is in 2 places, San Diego and San Jose. I looooove SeaWorld! I never get to do anything for my birthday, so this year this is where I was ever so lucky to go! This place genuinely makes me happy, so when it was all agreed we could come here for my 28th birthday, I was literally to the moon with happiness! Prior to coming here I purchased ""Fun Cards"" which have minimal black out dates and certain restrictions, they were on sale for the low price of $55! Normally pricing is $80 for children and $86 for adults! Parking of course is not included, but to park it costs $15. You can find locations across the bridge, but who wants to walk after a day full of walking? LOLUpon entering I was beaming from ear to ear with a smile, seeing all the folks parking and then walking into SeaWorld made my year! This place is great for people of all ages, who doesn't love to see dolphins and penguins?? We registered our play passes and got scanned into the park. There we gathered some maps and went on the skyride, this is a great place to start because its roomy and you get an overview of the park.From there you can attend the dolphin habitat, where you can get up close with them (One of my favorite places!) and you can even feed them! For a small price, of course :)Grabbing a map and coordinating your times, including walking times, is the best way to go. We were able to catch Blue Horizons show, which was amazing! One Ocean, do not sit in the center area! and Pets Rule! OPI was seriously our favorite!Through out the park theres many places for a photo op, I was in love with the puffin!! They also have various rides for everyone, which my son loved! Manta is def his favorite!Lastly they have the various other exhibits, one of our favorites was the Manta Rays! You get to get up close and touch them and everything! Great place to take photos, as I took a slew!All in all, SeaWorld is going to be a place were I continue to go. This place is one of the places that actually brings me happiness and gives me the feels! This birthday trip was seriously one of the best I've ever had, literally.Yay!"
523,6/15/2017,4,"OK, let me break it ALL down as best I can. First off, I am a dad of 2. Daughter in her teens and son in junior high. I haven't been to Sea World since I was a kid in the 70s. So yes, Gen Xer here. About all the stupid anti-seaworld, zoos, heck even the circus, etc. internet junk. I *think* it's messing with everyone's heads. If there's any mistreatment of animals, it's NOT an organizational thing, it's an individual thing. Maybe in the OLD days management allowed that thing to happen, but with all the awareness now, it's just plain bad-business to mistreat animals. I noticed NO mistreatment of animals here. All the animal trainers were very loving people.Alright, off my soapbox. Here's the break down...PART ONE - BEFORE YOU GO1. PLAN/BUY YOUR EXPERIENCES ON-LINEYes, I know, *some* people just like to show up, wait in a LONG line, and ask question after question to a disinterested-teenager at a customer service counter. Seaworld has a great-website and explained every detail of your tickets. My recommendations? Â  a. Quick Que - which is their version of fast-pass, front of the line, etc. If you HATE lines, have an injury or bad knees - DO THIS. For $20 it's pretty handy. You get a ticket to show attendants. Â b. Reserved seating - if you hate being stuck with a bad seat in a show (like back, far left - where are cant see), for $10/more a ticket you pretty much ALWAYS get center section up to 10 min before the show. You get a ticket to show attendants. Â c. All day dining - ok this one takes some math. Remember you are eating at an amusement park, so think movie theater prices versus McDonald's! My family of four cost about $127 (3 adults, 1 kid). We ate two meals of about $55 each (lunch and dinner), and a *snack* at $25 so math-wise... we spent $135. But what makes this work is you can eat every HOUR ( we didn't realize that! ). So do a breakfast when they open at 9am, then lunch, then dinner at 5:30 before they close. Plus you can just get drinks in-between which is about $20... so potentially about $100 in savings if you work it right. You get a wristband to show cashiers. You GET one entree, one non-alcohol drink, one dessert or side dish. The band works at all the sit down restaurants in the park but NOT the food booths. Still a great thing. And the food, it's pretty decent and somewhat large portions. Â d. Animal experiences - we opted out.  Â e. Parking - prepay if you want to avoid the hunting for exact cash or waiting for the parking attendant credit card machine. The cheap $17 general parking isn't THAT far away - you've parked farther at a grocery store. If you have elderly or disabled family, just drop them off at the entry curb and then park. :)NOTE - if you go the online purchase route, you WILL have to pop into guest services to pick up passes. It's a 20min wait at park open. Yes, it's a line, but pretty much the only one we waited in all day. There are kiosks on-site that sell this stuff too but, I like to plan ahead personally.2. PLAN THE SHOWSThere was only ONE ORCA show (2pm) Â on the day we went. So if you missed it, you missed it. You can string the shows one after the other as they are within a 2-5 minute walk through the park. Do this as well as the reserved seating option.3. PLAN TO GET WET and SUNBURNEDThe shows will get you wet, the rides will get you wet. Don't wear your interview clothes.My 2-cents. Wear a swimsuit under your clothes, pack a light jacket in a backpack. Flip-flip/walking sandals, BIG hat. The shows don't provide much sun cover so...4. PLAN A SHORT DAYPark hours are only 10am to 6pm. This isn't Disneyland open until mid-night.The first animal shows start at 11am-ish. So think breakfast in park at 9am, do the shows late AM, lunch, dolphin shows and Orca show and another animal show, and rides late afternoon. Dinner at 5-ish. Done!PART TWO - THE PARKCondition - the park is in pretty good shape. Bathrooms are clean and attended. (They are a little spaced out though.) Mostly all the rides are newer, so nothing weird there. Some of the exhibits show their age - like the aquarium, but get past that. People - the trainers know their stuff, super nice people. Ride attendants are fairly courteous (but keep in mind, these are teens mostly, so don't expect treatment like you are at the Ritz hotel). Shop attendants are courteous.Other Park Guests (like you) - there WILL be a lot of young families and strollers and grandparents. If you don't like crying kids stay way.I hope this was helpful. I was telling my wife that I thought we brought our kids here 5 years too late. It's a GREAT experience for kids 4 to 10. No one is going to come away from a visit to this place wanting to abuse or hurt animals, in fact, you will love them more and definitely be more aware of your enviromental behavior. Seaworld's brand is taking care of marine life. Short of diving into the ocean, this is about as close as you will get to these beautiful creatures."
524,7/6/2016,3,"Before I start off I'd like to make it very clear that Sea World compensated us 5 free tickets, refunded mine and my sons all you can eat passes and let the kids pick out stuffed Shamu's free of charge. They really went out of their way to accommodate. With that being said this review isn't meant to bash them because I've been going there for years and always had a good experience. Last Friday (7-1-16) myself, girlfriend, my two sons and her daughter all went to Sea World. The kids ages are 4, 5 and 7. Naturally since we have little ones we went straight to the kids area after we ate lunch. My 7 year old was in the play area where the kids run through what looks like punching bags hanging down. I was waiting for their time to expire when I see the Sea World attendant walk into the play area leading my son out with his hand over his right eye. As he got closer I could see blood and knew this was more serious than just a little bump. As I examined him I naturally moved his hand away and saw a big gash (like a boxer would have) above his right eye. Now I fully understand accidents happen and I'm ok with that however, what happened next really angered me. When I realized the severity of his injury I told the park employee who was running that play area to call away for a medical emergency. So she tried. She dialed one number. Then 2. Then maybe another. Time was passing and I was growing impatient. So I told her again. CALL AWAY FOR YOUR MEDICAL RESPONSE TEAM NOW! She tried dialing again. She then said she was unable to get ahold of anybody and nobody was picking up the phone. She pointed to a building and said to take my son over to it and I should receive help. At this point I was already angry and unfortunately snapped at her saying telling her this has to be a joke. I told her again to pick up the phone and call away for your medical response team or call 911! She accommodated and started dialing again. My girlfriend asked if they had any napkins or a first aid kit on hand. They had nothing. She was finally able to get ahold of someone told me help was on the way. So again we sat there and waited. From the moment my son was walked out and me examining him to this point over 10 minutes had passed. I then saw the Sea World EMT start making his way toward us. Now when there is a medical emergency, especially in regards to a child you would think there would be some sense of urgency. There was NONE. He nonchalantly walked up like he was out for a Sunday stroll. He examined my sons eye and informed me he would definitely need stitches. Ummm.... You think? He proceeded to dress the wound. He then told me we would make our way to the first aid station and either have an ambulance come or give me directions to Rady Children's Hospital. They put my son in a wheel chair where walked us to the front. The safety supervisor up front was very nice and very helpful. Left it to me to decide if we wanted an ambulance to come (he even recommended it) or he would give me the address and directions to the hospital which was only about 15 minutes away. Since we still had out 4 and 5 year olds I opted to drive him while my girlfriend stayed back with the two little ones. Now some of you maybe wondering why I waited to leave a review. I wanted to take the time to cool off so I could leave a well thought out review. My goal here is not to get anybody in trouble or blast Sea World. I'm hoping someone high on the Sea World chain will see this and understand that although compensated, their staff is clearly undertrained when it comes to a medical emergency. There was nobody to answer the phones when the attendant attempted to call, there was no first aid kits or even cloths to apply pressure on the wound. A kind person offered a nice handkerchief to use. As I stated earlier in this review I fully understand that accidents happen. And we were compensated nicely. But I would really like to know that Sea World will take training their staff in case of medical emergencies in the future. If anything use this incident as an opportunity to get better in an area that is obviously lacking. If whoever reads this plans on visiting Seaworld SD I recommend bringing your own first aide kit. Especially if you have little ones."
525,1/5/2018,5,Seaworld was good. Â Attractions were good. Rides were good. Â Got in for free for being military. Â That is great.
526,7/14/2017,1,some idiot was doing some bad things Â and they thought it was me so they called 4 security Guards on me as you see I'm w alking away in the video but they wouldn't let it go so I finally stopped and Confront them so they will leave me and my family i would not recommend to come to this seaworld I'm never going back there again!!! And I'm gonna make sure every one I know dose not go back there! I want a Apology!!! worse Experience ever!
527,1/1/2018,5,"Great Sea Life AdventureAnyone that loves nature, animals and the oceans belongs at Sea World. Don't believe the propaganda because they take great care of these animals that live long, healthy and happy lives. We love the shark encounters and manta rays. Lots of great rides for the whole family."
528,11/13/2016,3,"I'm sorry shamu! My son loves sea creatures so much, I had to take him to Sea World. I didn't see Blackfish, but I heard all about it and saw the highlights. With that said, I'm still reviewing objectively. We went on a weekday to avoid the crowds and it was definitely not crowded, but Sea World, I guess, knows this as they really don't try very hard on the weekday. A lot of things were closed that are normally open on weekends. No Sesame characters at the Sesame area. A lot of extra stations they had were also closed with signs saying only open weekends. I wish I knew this and could have weighed the pros and cons of coming on a weekday. Weekday was not crowded and it was very easy to get Â good seats at shows. The lines for the few rides they had were almost non existent. Overall, I'd prolly pay the ""few"" more bucks and take my kid to Disneyland."
529,9/23/2018,1,"So fucking dumb, I came last week to the park and they said my pass was expired so I paid for it and updated my card so they can auto ally charge me as they normally do and I came today only for the same shit to happen they said my pass was expired so I lost two hours in that ridiculously long line and I'm hella pissed"
530,4/8/2018,5,"I took my two daughters and they love it. They have so many activities for children of all ages. The animals are well taken care off. The new orcas show has bring updated it gives a lot of information on them. The food is okay, I really recommend sea world for a family trip!!!"
531,7/17/2016,5,What an amazing experience. Today was my first Sea World experience and boy was it a pleasure. Like any amusement park the parking is overpriced but expected. The mixture of shows and rides tied with craft beer and frozen margaritas was a big plus. The food wasn't special but again should be expected and I really enjoyed the self serve model at most spots eliminating the lines and wait. Our crew was blown away with the staff and trainers and their ability to control/train these wild animals. Keep an eye out for deals as Sea World is constantly rotating their promotions and marketing strategy. For example if your a state teacher or military vet the park will wave the admission and even let you walk in a few guests upon arrival. The longest wait time for any attraction or show was only 15 minutes and the weather this Sunday was a beautiful 70 and sunny. We were able to see all the park at to offer with regular admission in about 10 hours so only 1 day is truly needed.
532,1/12/2018,3,"I used to love SeaWorld, San Diego. It brought back alot of childhood memories and as a young adult, I always found it an amazing place to visit.However, this visit at SeaWorld is turely different than all of the previous experiences, you can feel the slow demise after the damaging documentary about SeaWorld that came out a couple years ago. The shows are very tightly packed, in fact, after reviewing the schedule as we entered SeaWorld, there is only ONE WAY to view all the shows during our visit, and unfortunately, it requires alot of zip-zap walking thru out the park to achieve that. That leaves little room to really enjoy the other features in the park such as aquariums and close interaction of the animals. In between the few minutes available shows, we have to jiggle between walking (very far), bathroom break and rushing thru any other attractions along the way.The shows is almost the same as the great shows that I had experienced three or four years ago during our last visit, however, that is also the problem, I feel that there is no update or new element for the shows that is enough to attract us back in the future.Many shows (the human show, forgot the name), the 4d movie, and the main ride Alantis is not available during our visit.The park hours is so short for our visit, I think it starts at 11am to 5pm or something around there.The whole experience feels very rushed and the impressive experience feel and sensation that SeaWorld had given us over the years is no longer, what was given instead is a feeling of just another commercial theme park."
533,7/5/2017,5,"After the whole controversy that came from a poorly made ""documentary"" I needed to return to Sea World to see what has changed since my review in 2011. Sea World has done a really good job in the six years to improve on the experience of being in the park and with the animals. There is a balance between entertainment (the rides) and education (seeing the animals). The new orca encounter is quite beautiful and showcases natural behaviors you would see orcas doing in the wild. Even the name ""Shamu"" is retired for the whales and only used with the costumes mascot. The park is changing and evolving with the times, and people need to understand that. When I see the dolphins playing on their own, not in the stadium, they are doing ""tricks"" you see in the show without anyone promoting them. Same thing for the orcas. Even during the shows and encounters you never see any of them being ""forced"" to do anything. This isn't like a circus with a tamer cracking a whip at a lion. I can see with my own eyes how much these trainers care for the animals in the park. Plus people need to look at the big picture of what Sea World does in the community. When there are trapped or injured sea animals on the coastline, Seaworld steps in to rescue and rehabilitate as needed. Without organizations like sea world, we wouldn't have that, and I often feel people forget that."
534,7/14/2019,1,Oh my lord. What has happened to Sea World? I haven't been here for 8 months. We've been bringing our kids here for the last 15 years. What a shame. First of all the lines? They make Disneyland lines look like nothing. The line for pineapple Pete's was literally to the front entrance. No ice cream for us. The Sesame Street area? A mad house. I'm gonna say it- no longer family friendly. The whole park looked like what I imagine visiting day at a prison looks like. Beer was thoroughly being enjoyed here leading to a little public drunkenness. Many rides shut down- the few open ones had a 90 min wait. Trash everywhere and the bathrooms? Lines for miles and once u finally get in the floors reek of pee. I have NEVER seen this park look so disgusting. It was like the bathroom of a water park. I'll be cancelling our passes. Sad it was such a great family park- a good place to bring little ones but not anymore.
535,1/29/2017,2,"Honestly this place is a dump. Do not visit please. Save your money, your kids lives and your time. This park han changed one thing since I was little. In ten years no improvements have been made. The shops and restaurants are expensive. And parking is $20.00. The rides suck. Even for kids. The animals are cool but this place is small and it seemed like a waste if money to me."
536,5/28/2019,1,"I've been going to Sea World since I was a kid. Â I hadn't been in several years and I've seen many of the exhibits change over time. Â If there was an award for making something that was really amazing into something appalling, they would win, hands down. Â It is truly a disgusting and depressing place. Â The whole place looks like it was designed by Fischer-Price. Â It's tacky, garish, plastic. Â The merchandising is relentless, it's shoved in your face every few feet. Â There is music (and some of it was old favorites of mine) BLARING all over the park. Â There is no escape. Â What's really sad is the animals are absolutely no longer the focus. Â Most of the big aquariums are gone. Â What's left over is pathetic, old, and just sad. Â No care is taken to make any of the animal exhibits look not completely industrial. Â When I went to buy a soda, I had to serve myself, two of the four fountains didn't work, and I had to wait in line several times before I finally a got a $4 small soda. Â After 90 min my boyfriend and I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Â I will never set foot there again. Â Horrible. Disgusting. Sad. Trashy."
537,4/3/2019,4,"Fun time but needs more than a full day to explore the whole park. Â Great exhibits, the staff are nice and provided great service. Dolphin show was particularly amazing to watch. Make sure to get a map as it can get quite confusing to navigate. Â The killer whale lunch and show was pretty good but didn't meet the hype. Feeding the flamingos was a fun. Seemed like a gift shop ever few yards but it's understandable as that's a cash cow. Â Photographers could have done a better job taking photos. The 3rd party shoos Pearl Factory was fun for the kids. Â Overall a good time!"
538,3/23/2019,4,"The whale and dolphin shows were amazing!! There weren't an abundance of rides but I guess it's sea world so it's more about the animals. Still had a good time, I could easily spend all day here. I brought my own food so the only thing I bought was ice cream. Fun experience will definitely be back soon."
539,4/1/2019,3,"We spent a day at SeaWorld. We had a nice day but there were some things that I think could make the park better. First of all, there are not a lot of rides and we only rode 2 but one of them took an hour and a half in line. I felt they were taking their time getting people on and off. Don't they know people don't want to spend their whole day on a few rides? They may attract more people if they were known to get people in and out of things so we could make the most of our day. There is not enough signage to find things. I was frantically trying to find an animal encounter and I got so lost. I couldn't find staff to help so I had to go ask the staff who worked in the food carts. I asked 3 people and every one of them had too look at my map and told me to go right or left, etc. I was disappointed that the staff didn't know where to find things and that there are no staff just sitting around to help answer questions or guide people. Honestly I think the customer service is why I love Disneyland so much. There's always someone to ask if we need something. I know there's a lot of controversy with the animals being captive but I felt like the staff truly loved the sea life that they were caring for. I think they treat the sea life well. I have mixed feelings about it. We had the dining plan and the food we had was pretty good. The dining deal was a good option."
540,9/28/2017,5,"Making my kids and myself love and appreciate the ocean, environment and all the animals that make the ocean it's home. I've always loved Sea World and hope to nurture my kids love of the sea. The education programs and animal interactions all reinforce the wonderful work and message Sea World do for the Earth. Â Highly recommend everyone to come here and fall in love with the animals."
541,7/23/2018,4,"Sea world was great for the kids. Not sure I would go if we didn't go with kids, but we had a good time. Busy during summer weekends, but not too bad."
542,8/11/2014,5,"We've had annual passes to SeaWorld for several years now. Â I pay roughly $35/month for a family of four which includes parking. Â Not too shabby!The annual passes include discounts on food and merchandise as well as free tickets! Â We got a free Guest pass to SeaWorld for each of our annual passes and were able to take another family with us once that hadn't been there in 10 years. Â Thanks so much SW.With the opening of the new Manta ride and the Reef exhibits near the front entrance, SeaWorld is a real theme park. Â It's huge and during the summer they have Club Atlantis when you want to party and dont' forget the free nightly fireworks! Â Tip #1: Ride the Bayside Skyride DURING the fireworks for an unprecedented view!On the right side of SeaWorld (per the map), the Seaport Marketplace offers up delicious burgers and a variety of craft brews.Tip #2: Â If you're local, save your plastic beer cup and re-use it for further visits. Â SeaWorld doesn't seem to mind and it saves you a couple of bucks. Â We actually kept forgetting to bring them so we accumulated like 10 of these beer glasses lol.You can also buy front-of-the-line passes for several of the rides. Â During the offseason, you won't need these but during the summer they can mean saving LOTS of time waiting in lines.Also, for locals, the Halloween and Christmas seasons are the best times to return to SeaWorld and do not cost a penny extra to enjoy the additional perks they add (free candy stations and the Christmas Celebration where Club Atlantis is where they truck in 6,500 square feet of fresh snow each day).I love SeaWorld despite the anti-SeaWorld/pro-Blackfish crowd. Â In all the years I've been to SeaWorld, I have never seen one animal die and have only heard about all the good the park does, yet 10 horses died in Del Mar's racetracks in two months. Â Where's the backlash? Â (smh)"
543,8/24/2014,5,"Awesome experience all throughout the day. It was my first time and it was worth the tickets and the 8 hour trip too (well we actually went to different places but this was our main destination).The place was huge and there was a lot of things to explore. We didn't get to ride any of their rides but we did see all the shows and got to check out the most of the animals. One thing I think we missed is the Mission Bay Theater but then again it was closed when we got there.The shows were spectacular, I honestly enjoyed every bit of it except for the ""pet rules"" I guess the stars (dogs, cats and everything else) were tired from doing all those tricks over and over and over."". Of all the shows we have seen there, the Cirque De La Mer is the one I truly enjoyed (funny because they never used any animals on that show).Touching starfishes, little sharks and manta rays, and getting a fish massage was something that I enjoyed at the explorer's reef. Among the different exhibits it was at the penguin exhibit and the arctic exhibit Â were the ones that I truly appreciated. Mainly because it was scorching hot that day and the cold and controlled temperature of the exhibits were a pleasant welcome for us...LOL Food can be costly but we stuffed ourselves at the dining with Shamu so it's all good.Dining with Shamu was a blast...literally! My mom got wet while one of the orcas were doing its tricks so it was an enjoyable as well as an entertaining meal. Over all I love it!"
544,3/21/2019,5,Halloween was cool! Sesame Street was there ! One awesome amazing parade . Great size candy bars for trick or treaters! Great time for my little toddler! I bought the whole day food wrist band which you pick up after gates in customer service areas . Well worth it!. They have charging cell phone stations there's one free area the rest are in lockers which you pay .
545,8/2/2018,2,"I have wonderful memories of Sea World, but I will never come back. Â I feel like I got ripped off and my tickets were free. The entire park has turned into a giant money grab. Â Everywhere you turn there is some horrible circus style game, a store selling overpriced junk, or a $13 beer stand. Â It's truly sad what Sea World has turned into. Â It's too crowded, the exhibits can't hold the crowds. Â I could go on and on, but what's the point? Sea World obviously doesn't care, nor do I."
546,3/5/2017,3,Clean theme park affordable parkinglittle expensive for what you get aquarium access not includedmain attractions in terms of rides the manta and atlantas by far the best followed by the rapids. would have loved more rides in general.the shows are okay Would highly recommend going in the summer because of the extended hours and fireworks
547,2/1/2018,3,"Not much to do. Not much to see. I did enjoy most of their shows, especially the one with the sea lion and dolphins. Sad to say I missed the showing with Shamu Â because I got hungry. Atlantis was closed when I went, which was disappointing because they had very few rides. The park's hours are already short to begin with since it closes at 5pm, however most of the things in the park closes BEFORE 5pm, which I think is a bit ridiculous. Most of the food were already put away and some rides closed at 4:45. They did have one or two cute merchandise, one of which was a Shamu plushie for $40 and I thought the shark necklaces were cool too and brought back some nostalgia."
548,7/31/2016,5,"Such a fun experience. The fire work show is amazing! You can see it from pretty much anywhere in the park. The staff is very knowledgeable & friendly. I love Sea World at night! It's so beautiful & the weather cools down nicely. I wouldn't recommend their crepes, but everything else was perfect!"
549,9/12/2016,4,I love Sea World and had the best time here today with my family !!! We arrived at opening & stayed till closing. We enjoyed many of the shows & also dined with Shamu for lunch !!! The Seasame street part was a first for us & my daughter & I had a blast so much fun & joy to see the look of excitement on her face :) Pros -It's Sea World !!! Â They do slot of great educational / rescue work :)Great family fun. Cons : the dine with Shamu food was flat out bad !!! I know it's more if the experience of watching the whales but you can do that free from the viewing tank so save yourself the $100 plus bucks & eat at somewhere in park or better yet bring your own lunch ? Parking fees are high!!!
550,12/24/2016,4,"Other than the fact that it costs an arm and a leg for tickets :( I love love love SeaWorld. I haven't been here in over 10 years and I was super excited to go! The shows were awesome! My favorite was the sea lion show with Clyde and Simon. It was super cute and funny. The weather wasn't the best, it was sprinkling and cold so we skipped the water rides or sitting in the splash zones. Maybe next time :) the food was expensive as expected so it's smart to pack some things in a cooler and enjoy your lunch outside at the picnic tables and come back in (don't forget to get a stamp) SeaWorld was so much fun, so many animals to see and so many new attractions. Wear comfy shoes, dress in layers, and be prepared for a fun time"
551,7/26/2014,3,"My visit two weeks ago was not as great as I remember it having come here several times during my childhood and during school field trips having lived in San Diego. Nonetheless, I will say I kept an open mind because I was with my family and niece and I wanted her to experience Sea World the way I did as a child.We loved the ""cleaning"" fishes at the front where you stick your hand in the water and they suck your dead skin off. Haha. Cool experience. We also enjoyed touching the sharks and helmet crabs and watching the Sea Lions Â It's sad this park is so outdated. The employees also seem very unmotivated. They should have team building exercises for them because customer service is everything. Make sure you read my review on Cafe 64.We did enjoy the Pets Rule show; the One Ocean show not so much. Still an okay trip but I probably won't be back until some significant renovations on the park and employees are made. One thing I did enjoy was the pre-dance ""show"" before the actual Shamu show began. The DJ really pumped everyone up. That was fun.Oh, be sure to sit stage right at the sunset Shamu show to capture great sunset photos! You're welcome :-)"
552,9/10/2018,4,"Love the changes SeaWorld has made in recent years. Definitely going in the right direction. But one problem remains: dining. There are way too few dining places, and they are set up to serve vey inefficiently, so eating at SeaWorld puts my family in a bad mood and makes us ready to leave! I'm here on a Tuesday in September. No lines for rides but 30 minutes to eat at 1:30!"
553,12/25/2018,1,We essentially gave free money to this park. We walked in and walked out. It's a zoo of kids and ignorant people. a corporate world of mindless idiots who exploit innocent creatures. The pools are no where close to being big enough to house the animals. you need not even 10 minutes to know that their animals are severely depressed. Keep the money and actually help these animals. Consider it a donation.
554,12/3/2017,5,Love this place! They get a bad rap from animal haters but it's still a great place to get near the sea and have a great time.Important to San Diego's animals
555,11/8/2017,4,"Had a great time at SeaWorld San Diego with my Mom. Â Definitely a park that you can complete in one day if you are not interested in riding the rides. Â Really loved both the dolphin and whale shows. Â The information given during the shows about how the animals come to be at the park and the conservation efforts of SeaWorld and their employees was fascinating. Â Best part of the day was the 'extras' on our upgraded ticket. Â For an extra $20 per person, we received front of the line passes for all the rides and shows, one photo each (of our choice) and all we could eat/drink all day (1 entree, dessert and drink per hour per person). Â The normal price of water is $4.50/bottle, so it was worth the extra $20 pp just to cover our drinks all day. :)I'm really glad we got to go to both SeaWorld and the San Diego Zoo during our trip, but if you only have time for one or the other, I think I would choose the zoo."
556,6/5/2018,1,Sea world now is making people with purse or bag pay $1 for locker. Won't let you ride rollercoasters. New this year.
557,8/17/2018,5,"Not often I give 5 stars but Seaworld earned it. This is a great family outing that has fun rides for all ages, great shows, surprisingly good food and is educational as well. Try the grilled cheese sandwiches by the sea lion show. Truly the best I've ever had. Don't miss the shows, the trainers are doing amazing work. The shark exhibit was nothing short of awe inspiring."
558,7/17/2018,1,Don't buy the all day food pass. Nothing we had was tasty. It was the equivalent of the target snack bar. Literally. And the service was terrible. Waiting 30 plus minutes just to grab a gas station quality pizza is nonsense.
559,11/29/2017,5,"This place does a wonderful job with their rescue efforts. I've been there while they were doing shows in the back for the whales, and so the stadium was closed. The killer whales are absolutely beautiful. I was blown away with how close we could be to see them, which was great.The dolphin show was one of my favorite parts. Dolphins Days is a wonderful, educational yet still entertaining show. I'm very aware of the issues going on around Seaworld, and I do believe the animals there are well taken care of. I still would love to work there if I could. I'll be going back this weekend!"
560,11/8/2017,4,"Came here on one of the hot October weeks San Diego was having and it was refreshing because that sea breeze! It made it about 5 to 10 degrees cooler than the inland! The park was easy to get to and don't pay for preferred parking if you come early as it is just like one row over! So say no thank you to the cash grabOnce you get into seaworld there are many things to do but grab a map real quick!In front of you will be the explorer's reed which you can touch small fish that literally eat the dead skin off your hand! It feels super weird but i promise they won't eat you alive!Sesame street bay of play is basically the Â where the kids play. They had journey to Atlantis where one employee said they would open at 11AM but when we went back again at a later time, it was even running. Not cool broThe wild arctic is super awesome. First it's the ride which takes you through the north pole and it's decent but after they lead you into an ice cold area (perfect for those super hot days) where there are narwhals, polar bears, penguins. The setting is like a arctic base in Antarctica. They even had walls that felt like ice! Definitely the coolest place of the park! Penguin encounter was okay, just a runway that'll take you to some penguins, like SO MANY penguins!!!We stopped by for the dolphin show because that's a must! And we were super hot so we went to the front area in the splash zone, I knew what was coming but boy was I not expecting so much water. Especially the water that flew in my mouth and it just tasted salty dolphin water the whole time but still loved the show!Turtle reef and shark encounter was cool. In the beginning the Shark encounter had like a pirates of a Caribbean vibe so that was pretty cool and it takes you from the top surface to underneath the sharks.Then of course to another show which was the sea lion and otter show. It was more of a comedy style and it was actually really funny seeing how the animals and actors work together was fantastic! Not too much splashing.Fresh water aquarium was nice but kind of meh, not too much to see nor anything of the exciting nature. The Bayside skyride was pretty cool, just a sky lift that loops across the water about 30-40 ft.I thought Aquariam de la mer was going to be more cool but it was just an octopus tank and that;s it. Another meh area. Aquaria was another meh area where it was just a bunch of different fishes.Did the Shipwreck rapids and you WILL get wet! So make sure to leave any valuables in the lockers right outside the ride. It's like the tire ride everywhere else has but it was nice to get on it since it was kind of hot.We went to the bat ray feeding area where you can buy squid for $5 which kind of seems expensive for about 5 small squids. So to feed the Manta ray you must hold the squid in your palm having it flat and putting your hand as low as you can. It's a weird feeling because you will feel like a vacuum which is how the manta ray eats!Last but not least was the Orca show which was awesome but Â it wasn't as great as the dolphins as the whales are more larger. We can clearly tell the Orcas was not happy as two of them had their upper fin sideways which means they don't have a lot of space.Upon exiting we took a survey and came up with some interesting tidbit. We found out that they might be phasing Orcas soon as it asked us if it was important to us. Upon further reading some articles , we found out that some seaworlds are phasing them out and this one might as well. So of you want to see Orcas, better see them soon because they might not be there anymore which is good for them."
561,8/14/2018,5,Lots better 2nd time around. Â Way more organized and nice employees :) it helps to get fast pass on rides
562,9/20/2018,1,"As much as I love how much Seaworld cares for the animals I got a bit of a surprise at the restaurant, Mama Stella, at lunch time the other day when I saw cockroaches on the tray area in line to pick up food. I love animals, not these critters around lunch. I mentioned to a mgr, and guest services. Not sure if it helped much to get the kitchen, and restaurant cleaned up."
563,3/19/2019,1,This place is the worst!!! Took 2 hours to get in and park. Â The attendants didn't care. Â Everyone was pissed when they finally got it. Â This is a management problem. Â  2 hours to get in and park it stupid. Â It literally hate sea world now and haven't even been inside. Â They suck!!!
564,7/17/2018,1,"Seaworld Aquatica!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's really sad that we as the San Diego community buy tickets to the water park for our children to get out the house and get a breeze but the moment we arrive we are standing in long lines for customer service absorbing heat we were trying to avoid in the first place and they only have two windows open verses 50 plus people in line like how is it that there's only two windows open and 1,000 plus ppl paying money to be accommodated in a timely manner. I'm confused !"
565,1/10/2017,5,"Seaworld has gotten more pricey every year, but if you are visiting or a local to SoCal, a membership pass (especially if you have kids) is a must! Â I would take my son here for the first few years as he is free under 3 years old. Â Then as he got older, Seaworld allows so many preschool passes (free annual pass) for kids under 5 years old. Â Which is an amazing deal. Â They also offer teacher passes as well. Â We are sad to see the Shamu show go, but glad we were able to partake in a historical ending event.Lines are typically long at guest area, but they put in new kiosks to help aide in fast retrieval and purchase of seaworld tickets. Parking is $17 for general and it goes up from there, if you have a membership parking is free and you can pay to upgrade. Â They have a ton of parking, but if you are leaving around the same time as everyone else, then it may take awhile - so be prepared, especially if you parked far from the exit. At the shamu show I learned and was able to see the expansion Seaworld has planned for 2017 and 2018 it will just become more amazing. Â They also have events for Halloween and Christmas! Its a must see and great experience for all ages!"
566,7/13/2018,3,"First time at sea world nice place, confusing when you purchase the all inclusive ticketCertain rides are not but they don't explain that at time if purchase, also it will be nice to have more shade on the line where you have to wait to purchase tickets, and mist since is hot humid and there a lot of children, also shade at the shows I feel is important"
567,5/21/2017,5,"I love SeaWorld. It has provided so many wonderful memories for my family. It's a favorite outing for my family. We love seeing all the animals. The crowds are never all that bad. The food deals are reasonable, especially if you go to the all day dining options on a day that's not crowded. I really like how the good that they do for animals. Yes, these animals live in captivity but they live a happy well cared for life. They are helping to raise public awareness for these animals. SeaWorld rescues and rehabilitates tens of thousands of animals. It's a wonderful organization. It's a shame that these liberal organizations run smear campaigns to defame SeaWorld and the good that they do."
568,9/16/2018,5,"Decided to go to SeaWorld on September 15, 2018 for the very first time with our 10 month old little girl. We saw the dolphin show and the whale in counter. The shows we amazing. We then were able to be up close and personal with the dolphins. Took a lot of pictures with the dolphins with help of the professional camera takers. The only issue we had was when we were getting ready to leave the park we weren't able to look at any of the pictures that the photographers took. They overcharged us and were quite rude. They wanted us to spend over one hundred dollars for 96 photos. But we spend 50 on two framed photos because of the impatient casher. Other than this the park was amazing and so was the experience!"
569,8/30/2018,1,"The customer service is horrible! I spent one and a half hours waiting for them to locate my pass. All I was dealing with was attitude from the manager as I am in the wrong! I ended up loosing patience I had my 4 kids with me, I decided I'd just buy a new pass, this clown tells me to go back and wait inline! Being from San Diego and buying passes every year this just might be the last year or last time I come again! #SEAWORLDSUCKS!!!!"
570,5/31/2017,4,"Blackfish this, blackfish that. Â I am not one to let a heavily biased movie decide where we can have fun! Â I love reading reviews to this place that say ""watch blackfish, 0 stars"". Â Did you watch ""making a murderer"" and immediately go online and review the Manitowoc County justice court?Direct from the SeaWorld Wiki page: ""SeaWorld San Diego is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums(AZA). Adjacent to the property is the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which conducts research on marine biology and provides education and outreach on marine issues to the general public, including information in park exhibits""It is not a bad place! Is it a little dated? Â Yes... yes it is... but it is also a fun place to visit! Â The ""poke bay"" is a great place to get to touch sharks, manta rays and other aquatic life. Â They also have people there that can answer most questions you or your little ones will have. Â Their rides are fun, and their Sea Lion show was great! Â They partner with the San Diego Zoo, and both places are great to visit. Â Watch out for the birds! Â They will take the fish literately out of your hands."
571,8/6/2016,5,Still my favorite place to go when I'm in San Diego maybe because I was a kid we used to come here on the weekends when we live there I wish they didn't take out the Clydesdales but they did oh well I think that adding of the rides makes it much better though favorite show is still the sea lion show very funny the sad thing is that they change the show from the whales and dolphins the trainers don't get in the water with them anymore which sucks thank you Blackfish I highly recommend taking one the tours
572,3/14/2018,5,my Family loves Sea world. We go often Â and have Annual passes. Do it right and the prices arent too bad! my sons are 9 and 7 between legoland and sea world our trips to carlsbad and San Diego areas are very fun.
573,7/27/2017,1,Drove from AZ. Â Went to Sea World on a Thursday in July very end of the month. Â No riders we're closed according to the sign at the entrance before we went in. The 4D movie was no longer here. Â Ship Wreck Rapids was closed. Â They said a few hours then the rest of the day. Â The skyride was closed most of the day. Â Sea World seriously has lost touch with what the market is wanting. The landscaping wasn't as nice and the park was generally dirty compared to what I remember. Â Very disappointed. They need to bring things up to a higher standard or there customers are going to continue to leave.
574,12/20/2017,3,"Update: I posted my previous review as I was forced to get the awful lunch for my family at SeaWorld. I can't change my review on the food but I am raising the stars because of the shows and employees at SeaWorld really justifies the visit. Â The Orca show was awesome because Killer Wales were pretty amazing creatures. There are extremely hard working folks running the show for The Sea Lion and Otter show. The guy who opened the show deserves a standing ovation for his effort and gals there were pretty fantastic with the Sea Lions. I also appreciate that the management responded to my comment and I wish that they do something about their restaurants and food quality and selection. Having a variety of ""healthy"" AND tasty snack and meal options will be critical to improve their customers experience. I should have checked Yelp before coming here. Except the Dolphins show, this place is like k-mart of themed park. For the job security of the current employees at Seaworld and San Diego city residents well-being, they all should demand the SeaWorld food department leadership and management change. Food was absolutely horrible and just awful. Save your money and don't come here until they up their game with their food and rides."
575,5/18/2017,2,"When visiting San Diego, one of the biggest attractions is sea world! I heard mixed reviews about it, but figured we would give it a shot. I was disappointed as soon as I walked in. Before purchasing tickets, it states tickets were $93 per person for ages 3 and up. I quickly looked on my phone and found them for $87 on sea worlds website. I did the purchase right there and then. After walking in, all I was able to see were concession stands and gift shops. It was actually very shocking. We walked pasted the bubble machines and tried to hide it from my son so he doesn't freak out. The exhibits where great, the ones that were open that is. Â Once again, every time you walk out of an exhibit, you're forced to walk brought a gift shop. Don't get me wrong, it's great for business! Causing kids to constantly nag at their parents to purchase them something from each shop. If I wanted to make constant purchase, I would have gone to the mall. I came to see animals and to give my son some job. I was very disappointed finding more than 50% of the part was a money scam."
576,8/17/2014,5,"I was thrilled to find that Sea World offers not just one, but two (maybe more) private nursing rooms in their park. The bathroom just outside of Atlantis/Wild Arctic offers a private room with a door that locks, a rocking chair and changing table too! It's large enough to fit a stroller and is just what this new mom needed! It's quiet so my little one isn't distracted while nursing. It's private for a mom learning to nurse outside of the home and it offers dim lights for just the right atmosphere.There is another such room located in the bathroom just outside of Shamu Stadium.Way to go Sea World for being mommy AND baby friendly!"
577,4/8/2016,3,"In the past I felt that Seaworld was bigger and more fun!! On this last visit I feel it's lost its charm. The park didn't seem as big and lots of shows were closed. Some exhibits were closed and aquariums not displaying everything. It was disappointing to be honest. Either way we had a great time with what we did see. We love seeing sea life up close and experiencing these amazing animals up close. Watching the killer whales, dolphins, sea lions and Balugas was great. We were limited to only two shows, the pet show and sea lion and otter show. The pets show was cute and funny as I remember but the sea lion show wasn't as good!! It was great to see how these lovely animals can be trained but not as entertaining. We were able to interact with the mantas for $5 to feed them. It's cool to feel how they suck the fish from your hand. We finally were able to ride Atlantis, which has always been closed in the past, and it was really fun. If sitting in the front be ready to get soaked like me!! The Manta coaster was a thrill and goes faster than appears. Overall the park is OK but maybe at a different time, like summer, it is more entertaining!!"
578,9/9/2018,4,"Perfect day and great exhibits, shoes, and rides. If you enjoy sea life this is the place to see it up close. Lots of hands on exhibits."
579,5/27/2018,1,Paid for the VIP quick pass for 4 of us and I call bull shit and won't buy it next time. Â There's no separate entrance and I am in line for 20 min already with general line
580,8/17/2017,1,"We wanted to see different sorts of life in the ocean but can only say that this is not an attractive attraction but rather a disappointing showcase of commercial interest hidden behind a story missing expectations with overpriced tickets plus excessive parking fees. We asked ourselves where have been the 29,000 animals mentioned by dome staff members. There are effectively more rides than animals, this is completely offtarget. Furthermore, there were no pengiuns, octopuss or clown fish. We thought thatthis is nothing for little kids. Last but not least, if they really support research and animal protection, why not put it on display? We cannot recommend this park at all. Very funny that Guest Relations questions our presence in the park after we spent more than 500 USD to visit, very poor ignorant style. If we didnt see this, Guest Relations should rather ask themselves what the park has done wrong, why we missed this, why we could not find it on the map we got or why we didn't see the signs."
581,6/16/2016,4,"Went with my fiance and it was our first time to SeaWorld. Â Our day got off to a bumpy start. Â We purchased our park and quick queue tickets in advance online. Â When we got to the park, I asked an employee if I could redeem my quick queue tickets at the purchase tickets counter before the park entrance. Â He gave us a confused look on his face and then said yes. Â So, we lined up for a few minutes, got to a rep and were told to go to the customer service counter inside the park to redeem our quick queue tickets. Â Fast forward to the customer service rep, who told us that we could just use our printed quick queue documents. Â I asked her if she was sure about, because the quick queue documents stated to redeem them for actual tickets at the park. Â Fortunately, her supervisor was nearby and directed her on how to print out actual tickets for us. Â While I was waiting in line at the customer service area, my fiance decided to go to the Shipwreck Rapids ride, to save time, since I didn't want to ride it. Â Unfortunately, it was closed for the day (don't know why).After we got our quick queue tickets, we proceeded to the SkyTower ride. Â There were two line ups, one for the top of the ride and one for the bottom of the ride. Â The employees at the entrance to the ride kept directing people to the line for the top of the ride, despite the line for the bottom of the ride being completely empty. Â To add to this disorganization, the employee letting people onto the ride itself was not filling it to capacity. Â At one point, there was room for 2 more people (e.g. my fiance and I), but because the group at the front of the line was 6 people, she couldn't let anybody else on. Â The ride itself was ok, the glass wasn't very clean and some of the seats were positioned so that you looked directly at part of the ride structure (view was obstructed). Â We attended all the shows. Â We had to start lining up for the shows 20-30 minutes in advance, because seats filled up quickly. Â We brought our own ponchos, which protected us from getting wet when we had to sit in the ""soak zone."" Â The majority of the shows started promptly on time. Â My favourite show was the ""Sea Lions Tonite"", very entertaining.I was disappointed that the Animal Connections was closed and we were not informed that they were going to close early. Â I really wanted to see the capybara in person.The distribution of food places could have been better, they seemed to be in a central location requiring us to walk far just to get something to eat. .In hindsight, since we were there the whole day (for both lunch and dinner), getting the ""All-Day Dining Deal"" would have saved us money. Â The wait time at the Calypso Bay Smokehouse during lunch was ridiculous, ~45 min. Â The flow of people moving through was just super slow. Â We didn't account for the wait time to be this long, and so we only had 5-10 minutes to shove down our food before having to catch the next show. Â I got the sampler platter and was not able to eat the chicken at all, it was too dry. Â The wait time at the Cafe 64 was also just as bad. Â There were about 6-8 people in front of us. Â The food was already made, and the people putting the burgers together seemed quick. Â It was the cashier that was slow. Â Also, half the employees were there, I guess because after 7:30 PM is not considered a busy time. Â For the last show ""Shamu's Celebration: Light Up The Night"", my fiance was disappointed that the show would still ""soak"" you, since people would end up having to go home all wet. Â Right after the show, we ran up to the top of the bleachers and were able to get a fairly good view of the fireworks.Our quick queue tickets came in handy at the Bayside Skyride (wait was more than 45 min), Manta ride (fiance rode twice), and Wild Arctic. Â I believe that the lines themselves didn't seem too long, but just the way the employees were processing people onto the rides was inefficient. Â I have seen much longer line ups and better processing efficiency at other parks, such as Universal Studios and DisneyWorld/DisneyLand. Â The Bayside Skyride was a bit disappointing, you just ride from point A and back to point B, no spectacular views or anything.Overall, I would recommend visiting SeaWorld if you're in San Diego and have never been (at any location)."
582,8/28/2018,4,"This is a fun amusement park with a lot of options to see the Sea animals, as well. Â The parking is organized and check in is the same as other parks. Â Bags are checked before entering the gates. Â Very crowded on weekends. Â If possible, better to go during the week. Â Food is expensive, as expected at a park, but it wasn't as crazy as dinner if the other parks. Â There's a lot of walking. Â There are several opportunities to physically interact with some of the wildlife. Â There is an extra charge for most of the interactions. Â There are petting pools for various things that are free."
583,8/5/2017,5,"What a great place to come visit for a full day of fun. Â We paid a little extra to park right up front and get to go back and forth from the park to picnic at our vehicle. Â We stayed at Sea World from all day to the night time and had nothing short of a amazing family adventure. Â We went to every show and every animal exhibit. Â Loved the flamingos, the sea ray pool and of course the Killer Whale performance. Â We then would go chill in the truck and eat what's in the cooler and have plenty of water and go back into the park. Â We stayed til the park closed and really enjoyed the fireworks show and performance they have for closing time. Â If you love marine animals and love San Diego then this is a must!"
584,8/13/2018,5,"This is probably one of my family's favorite Summer vacation spots. The all-day dining is a great meal option, our favorite is the Shipwreck Cafe. The shows are good and change with time. Make sure to catch Sea Lions Tonight and Cirque De la Mere in the evening. Also, for the little ones Ocean Explorers is a great new addition. Journey to Atlantis and the Electric Eel are close by too. All in all, SeaWorld is great for a vacation."
585,8/18/2018,5,It was a very nice experience. We went on a Friday and it wasn't very pack. The lines weren't long. 20 minutes max wait time. I enjoyed myself! I would recommend to others! Watch the shows if you have a chance!
586,8/11/2018,4,"It was a very warm day and there was the raft ride, journey to Atlantis and the little kid walk through water sprout that day so I felt like they could add a few water ""rides"" or things to do for little kids during he weekday. A few rides were closed and many people walking around. I had brought my 2-year old who likes Elmo and we had to tell her she couldn't see him bc he only comes on weekends. Ya she forgot about it but it would have been cool to ""see"" him. Besides that, the light show at the end was nice. I liked that they were open late and offered ""quick queue"" (like fast/flash passes) for some of their main/big attractions at the actual rides, unlike other parks that want you to go super far to get passes that cost a fortune. I will definitely be returning."
587,5/8/2018,1,Only came here for the rides.Was a long wait to ride the one. Just get rid of the animals and make this all rides! That's what San Diego needs!!
588,9/1/2018,1,Took my son to sea world for the first time today to have dinner was Elmo. Food was great until I found a dead fly in my salad. Showed it to one of the workers & all she did was take my salad & ran back to the kitchen. You can tell she was trying to hide it. Didn't not even receive an apology or anything they just ignored the situation. Ended up having to talk to guest services about the situation at least they apologized. Love sea world but would not eat there again. Wouldn't like my child to have insects in his meal. Thank you Sea World.
589,2/26/2019,4,Fun place we came when my little boy just two and he was entertained by sea creatures.
590,7/31/2014,3,"With all the buzz about this place, my friend and I would beg to differ. So purchasing tickets on a weekday is pretty cheap--$50. But why doesn't this include parking fees?! If I were paying full price for this place, this place's review would suffer. So for $64 this day ($16 for parking), the experience was decent. Not the wowing memories we were expecting to have. Totally not worth the money and time lost though.So even after going on a Monday, one of the water rides took 2 hours!! Yes, my friend and I waited 2 hours in line for a 5 minute water ride--Shipwreck Rapids. And the sad part, the ride itself was miserable. The air was chilly, and the water was cold. All those riding with us commented the same things. We were soaked and freezing as we exited the ride. :(The BaySide Skyride was pretty cool. The line wasn't as terrible for this one. It was a quick 5 minutes or so where you're above the water with a view of the park, well, parts of it anyway. Â  The only parts worth the admission price were the shows. We saw the Shamu along with the sea lion and otter shows which were super fun and entertaining. Those were worth the wait time baking in the sun. There were neat little stops where you can have a personal up close encounter with some sea creatures too. That's cool, but I felt too old to be excited for these areas. Sadly, SeaWorld, I didn't leave you with a positive experience."
591,8/6/2018,5,"Great interaction and shows. We didn't get on many rides as we were exhausted from legoland. However, we did enjoy ourselves and my son had a great 7th birthday weekend!! We truly loved visiting San Diego and all it had to offer!"
592,6/22/2017,4,"If you're visiting San Diego, you have to visit Sea World. The orca (killer whale) show is probably the highlight of the entire park. It's amazing what they're able to teach those mammals. When we arrived, the first show we saw involved the sea lions. It was a fun and entertaining show. There were multiple showings, therefore, it wasn't crowded. The orca show was jam packed because there was only one showing (2pm). Unfortunately, the Skytower was closed for maintenance the day we visited, so we didn't get a chance to go up and get a nice view from up top. There's quite a few rides for the kids (and adults) at Sea World. One ride in particular that my son and I had fun on was the Riptide Rescue. You're definitely going to get wet on this ride. There's not a lot of shade in Sea World, so I suggest applying sunscreen and wearing a hat. While the orca show was amazing, at that time of the day, we were sitting directly in the California sun. My wife actually ended up getting sunburned. Try going on a weekday, when it's less crowded."
593,3/17/2015,4,I haven't been here since I was little and I enjoyed coming back and seeing the aniamals and shows.I remember the Shamu show being more spectacular..maybe because it was in the Cirque Stadium which is bigger. Â I did enjoy the new rides like Manta and Atlantis. Â I came here during a Saturday and to my surprise it was not as crowded as I thought it would be. Â I was here during their Halloween Spooktacular where guests go trick or treating throughout the park which was a nice touch for everyone.
594,8/4/2018,4,"Had absolutely a great experience. The shows were great, did not have long waits. Only downside was the food, not a lot of options for kids other than that it was great."
595,4/29/2014,5,This place was totally amazing!!!!!! This was worth the trip from San Pedro. There was so much to see in such little time the shows are amazing. The animal show with all the tricks is unbelievable. The shamu show it's incredible need to be there early to get good seats...
596,7/25/2017,5,"What a wonderful day! I used to go to the old Ohio location (in Aurora), but never been to this location. Clean, great food (we are lunch at the Baja grill), super fun shows. All the exhibits and rides were so great! No need to buy anything extra, just plan on getting to the shows 20 minutes before and you'll have great seats. Lines were never more than 30 minutes, as we did all of the rides early. My daughter went to SeaCamp earlier this year- after today, she absolutely wants to continue her education in marine biology.Thank you for a wonderful day!"
597,8/26/2018,5,"Been to SeaWorld 2 times now and i must say that it is a very nice and fun place to go with family and friends to spend a whole day. Â Got to do lots of things like, riding roller coaters, petting the animals, and watching lots of Â different shows/encounters, but the best one was the Illuminight show. Don't forget when coming down here, you must eat the turkey leg. I've tried it 2 times now and its soooo delicious... Also got a bottle of drink where u can get free refills for the whole entire day haha!! Everyting here was amazing!!!"
598,7/23/2018,3,So the attractions were very good and the animals were treated like royalty. The reason for 3 Stars was all due to the very very poor customer service!!!!!! Â I met 3 very nice and helpful people in my 9 hours in the park. 3 out of approximately 40 employees I came in contact with NOT including the trainers and care givers!!!!! Sea World better start doing CUSTOMER SERVICE trainings because I will not come back anytime in the near future.
599,12/26/2017,4,"It was my first time here. My boyfriend and me enjoyed the shows. They schedule the shows with perfect time slot, so basically you could watch all the shows. We were there in mid December, we got wet as we picked the wet zones for better view of the show, I walked out this park with wet body and that was chill in my bones. Â But still, we enjoyed the great time here."
600,2/29/2016,4,"If you're a kid, or have one, I think this can be a remarkable and memorable experience. Â As an adult, I like it but do not love it. Â  Every 10 years would be fine with me.

601,7/3/2018,1,I went here last weekend for the first time and let me just say I wish I had saved my money for something better. This place is so hyped up for nothing. The admissions is so over priced and it doesn't include any of the rides inside the park. You have to pay extra for that. The aquarium sucked. They barely have any animals in there. Somethings were okay like the seals and the SSL show they have but long story short not worth the money.
602,7/3/2018,3,"C'mon Sea World, such an amazing place ruined by poor customer support. We spent a Sunday there waiting in long lines I would understand if the park was overcrowded but it wasn't. The problem was poor line management. None of your staff filling seats managing the line like every other theme park in America. Oh and by the way there is the opportunity for a smile and a friendly contact. Instead we saw empty seat after empty seat. Â Then the money grab 3 - 15 dollars for express passes. As wrong as that is to begin with there was rarely a staffer checking that these patrons actually purchased a pass. The electric eel had a safety harness come loose while a patron was on the ride Â  Pretty scary stuff. Tells me someone didn't check properly which I witnessed. The call was made for a tech and the ride stopped. The answer throw a staffer in the seat and live test it in front of 1000 people. Yikes. You want to be a big time theme park maybe you should train and act like one. Would I go back sure we love Sea World! Â Just hope you take this as it's meant to be constructive criticism."
603,12/31/2018,1,I hate to have to leave this but Seaworld pulled a scam running billboards near LA area advertising Rudolph this Christmas. Â The Rudolph experience runs only a few times a day and you would be better off watching it @ home. Â The only special effects are soap suds and red lights in theater. Â Christmastown is epecially week. Â The donut holes came right out of a freezer. Â The food @ Park might have been the worst I ever had. Â I found a hair in my 2y//o's chicken tenders and the rotisserie chicken I ordered might have turned me off of chicken for 2019. Â We won't be going again. Â If you need one more Christmas fix and are from LA save your time and money and go to Knott's merry farm. Â Seaworld really blows.
604,6/23/2016,5,"We got the yearly pass again. It's been so long since I was last here. We went on a Thursday around 1:30pm. I opted for closer parking which cost $21. Otherwise normal parking is $16. Â We were only able to do the raft ride which was a lot of fun. Beware because you get really wet. I'm glad to see dryers so you and a few people can dry off your clothes for $6. We watched the sea lion and otter show, Shamu, and the cirque du soleil kind of show (sorry, I forgot the name). That was my favorite. Then the kids played in the touch pools and felt baby sharks and little fish. Â Glad we got the annual pass because there's a lot more to see."
605,8/19/2017,3,"Went to seaworld yesterday after getting off work. Parking wasn't an issue at all. Unfortunately, we didn't know that seaworld closed at 6 on Friday so we were only able to go and see a few things. Visited the aquarium where all the fish are and that was neat seeing all the different fish. Next we went to the starfish pool unfortunately I didn't see any starfish. I don't know if maybe they were removed since people always hold them and take them out of the water when they aren't supposed to. Following that we went to visit the dolphins and I loveee dolphins Â sadly I couldn't get any to come up to me lol. Lastly we rode ship wreck rapids! Fun ride and the line wasn't long at all. Got waaayy more wet then what I was expecting though lol. Finished the night with some dippin dots on the way out of the park. All in all a good experience just wish the hours of the park were extended."
606,7/28/2016,4,"We had to take the family because it's the last year with the Killer Whale Show. Â The best deal is the San Diego Pass from Cotsco. Â You can see the Zoo, Sea World, Safari and many other attractions consecutively. Â Make sure you get there early, bring hats, shades and sunscreen. Â Parking is $17 and no outside food. There are no awnings or shade when you are watching the shows and we all got sun burned.The shows are great and you can touch so many animals. Â There are only a few roller coasters but they are awesome! Â I highly recommend the all day food plan because you can eat all day long for $34 dollars for adults and less for kids. Â We leaned our lesson after we got robbed by buying some stale over priced hotdogs for the kids.We stayed all day long and enjoyed the fireworks at the end of the night."
607,11/4/2016,4,We went here on a weekday and there were no lines!! It was awesome. The shows are fantastic and entertaining. In my opinion the shamu stadium show wasn't hat good. Out favorite was the sea lion and otter show. Â Sea World has a perfect combination of rides and shows. It's great for people of all ages.Some tips: bring water!! It's expensive there.Taking one star off as the parking is crazy expensive and there aren't enough shows.Will probably go again once.
608,4/10/2017,2,"It's generally a nice way to waste a day, but:- there aren't many sea creatures to see. This is more of an amusement park and less of a place to see and interact with animals- prices are ridiculous. Tickets , parking, gift shops... - overall shows were not impressive except a few of the tricks that the dolphins pulled - my toddler hated the whole thing and I can't blame her - the majority of what you will see is gift shops and restaurants. You can do that for free at a lot of other places, minus the $180 for tickets and $30 for parking and minus the gazillion people in front of you.Overall value for money I feel is 1* but just because the dolphins were cute I give it 2 starts."
609,1/22/2016,3,"My husband and I both have two year passes and we take our toddler to Sea World very often. My son, specifically, loves Sesame Street and we spend most of our time there. It's very entertaining for a toddler. I wrote a separate review of Sesame Street last year and gave them a well deserved five stars!However, this review is of Sea World as a whole and I have to deduct a few points because I truly believe it's inhumane for them to keep the killer whales in captivity. Although the trainers at Sea World mean well and treat their animals the best they can, I personally believe these Orcas need to be released back to the ocean where they can swim freely for hundreds of miles in the ocean and be free--where they belong. I appreciate Sea World's rescue efforts of other animals. Sea World helps thousands of injured animals, which is to be commended. All the dogs and cats at the Pet Show, for example, are rescue animals. Overall a great place and very entertaining for children! Tip: parking is $16, but free with annual passes"
610,5/9/2016,5,I took my son here today and it was a great father son day! Â We had such a great time seeing all the animals and even got to pet a dolphin named Rain and a small little shark in the kids area!! The park is awesome the employees are great to the guests and the trainers are full of knowlege and love for their animals!! I will be coming back with my son and supporting Sea World as often as possible! Who would not want to make memories at such a awesome beautiful place! Thanks Sea World!!
611,1/14/2018,3,"I just visited the park with my kids twice and we upgrade the ticket to the annual pass, we were very impressed with everything specially ORCA and the dolphins. But not all of the rides is always working all of the time, so be sure before paying money that what you want is open and working properly.there is 20$ parking fee."
612,5/5/2018,4,"Came here on a Sunday and I had a good time. It was my first time going to Sea World. The parking lot is hugeeee. Once you park, (don't get shocked) but you're going to stand in a longggggggggg line just to go through security check. At first you're going to think omg, there is no way I'm standing in this line, it's going to take 4 hours for me to get in. That's what I thought first but the line goes by pretty fast. Max 30 mins if that. Once you go through security check you're good to go. The place is huge. Make sure you don't wear black; I went on a very hot day (got sun poisoning days after; didn't know that existed lol) so make sure you wear light colors and the least possible clothes. Stay hydrated. You will be doing a lotttttt if walking. The lines weren't long at all. I'm not sure if you can attend all the shows in one day. The place is just so huge. Food was good. We ate at some chicken place. Sea World is a place where you go once and never again lol. This place is mainly for kids I'd say. Not really for adults."
613,8/11/2018,5,"I love Sea Wold! Now that I get to enjoy it with my own children , it is so much more fun to go back and see their faces light up! The only thing I wish they would have ac in their restrooms and baby changing areas. On a very hot day like today, those facilities were nasty to step into."
614,5/9/2016,5,I loveeee this place!!!!! We came last last Saturday and it was sooooo crowded!! We saw pretty much all of the shows starting with the Pets Rule! This was one of my favorite show!! They had sooo many dogs and cats and animals doing tricks!!! My other favorite was the dolphin show they did soooo many tricks my daughter loveeeed it!!!! I thought it was even better than the orca show. And my absolute favorite was the MAGIC!!!! For the month of April they had magic shows and the one we had seen was absolutely spectacular!!!!!!! I still can't believe some of the things that he did I was saying wow every 2 minutes. Parking was pretty sucky but that's okay. OMG & the couple that was in front of us gave us some free photo tickets which was soooooo nice!!!!! It was a real good day for my family. & OH MAKE SURE YOU GET SOME DIPPIN' DOTS!!!!!!!
615,8/11/2018,5,"First time I see world, it was such a great experience. I took my eight-month-old with us and he did great. It is hot during the summer so I would suggest coming around 2 PM. But overall had a great time. I love that they interact roller coaster rides along with the sea world education. And I got to say the best part about today was seeing the killer whales/Orcas show."
616,4/20/2017,5,"If you're there for rides, you'll be disappointed. The main attractions are the shows from the sea animals. My son loved the dolphin, sea lion, orca & other animals doing great tricks & flips. Exhibits were pretty awesome as well. I was great to see so many sea animals up close. I love animals & I think my son will grow the same love for the animals as well. I'm glad that we bought the fun pass (year pass). Restaurants inside have great quality food. Buying the whole day food pass was a great idea.Must go for families who love nature & animals"
617,1/27/2016,3,"I haven't been here in a while. Â This place is more expensive than I remembered. Â It's like almost $80 per person! Â If I were going to spend that much, I think I'd rather go to Disneyland. Â Luckily we were invited by my sister who was able to get free passes for me and my wifey.I've always enjoyed coming here as a kid. Â We ended up seeing the Sea Lions Live Show, Pets Rule Show, and visiting several other attractions. Â The shows were both entertaining.We already made dinner plans elsewhere, so we weren't interested in eating here. Â I did see food stands all around Sea World. Â Interestingly, I saw one that was selling turkey legs of all things.4.0 / 5.0 - Service2.0 / 5.0 - Pricing / Value3.5 / 5.0 - EntertainmentI'd rate Sea World 3.5 stars. Â Not sure I'd come here more than once a year, free or not."
618,5/25/2017,1,"Just don't waste your money to visit this place...almost $100 per ticket if you buy from the ticket machine while you can book it online for $55. I don't know why there's Â almost double price difference. Can anyone from sea world park explain to me?If you really need to go, check the hours before you go. I went there on Wednesday... it's just a disaster for the hour. . I just want to have the sea world management team to walk around the park to see how long do they take!! They only open from 10 to 5.... absolutely don't have enough time to go over all shows and places inside..especially a parent, when you need to take care your kids and stay in some place for a bit longer, you will just run out of time!"
619,2/13/2018,4,"I think that since Blackfish came out things really changed for them. They keep distance from the whales. anyway Monday morning, the place was for us. We really had great time, and I can tell you that the children will have the best time. The arctic part was little boring."
620,1/8/2018,5,SeaWorld is definitely the place to go.Last time we were there we got a season pass for the whole family for a great deal.Don't miss out on the shows.
621,6/2/2017,5,I had the best time with my family. We were all fascinated by the dolphin show and the orcha show. Truly amazing mammals. Â I was also very impressed with the talent of the trainers. It is definitely a place my children will never forget. We hope to visit the park as much as possible.
622,11/21/2017,1,"- run down- some tanks and pools are soo filthy- bathrooms are out of soap, clearly looks very old- some animals look like really in a bad condition - definitely going out of business soon.. It's our first time at the Sea World and will be last. I honestly regretted it after a long day seeing all the shows and animals. I wish we went to a state park or a beach instead because San Diego has so many great recreation areas. Don't waste your money here.."
623,6/30/2018,1,Super crowded and those eat all day wristbands are a joke. My husband and brother in law waited 1 1/2 hours just to get food. They complained to the manager about how it was already time to get their second meal & she was very rude. A lot of customers were upset over this Â ridiculous wait
624,5/7/2016,5,Love coming here and supporting Seaworld. They do an amazing job in helping out the wild life that are sick or injured. My cousins and I come here quit often to watch the shows and see the different animals.
625,6/11/2017,4,"The new Orca Encounter is good stuff. Â The audience gets to observe a variety of behaviors and learn about the use of them in the wild. Â It isn't a trick show or aggressively over the top. Â The new set is pretty and the video screen is well used. Â Beyond that, the Manta roller coaster is one of my favorites in So Cal and the food at the BBQ (Calypso?) is good. Â We also enjoyed peaking over the wall at the dolphin pool to see a group of dolphins swimming around and playing with trainers in a relaxed, playful setting."
626,2/9/2016,4,"A large part of my childhood has to do with visiting Seaworld many, many times.My sisters and I always had an annual pass when we were younger, and would come here at least 1-3 times a week because we had nothing better to do and Seaworld is really a fun place to be when you're younger.Now that we're older, we only come here on super rare occasions because we've obviously seen everything.It' definitely recommended to get an annual pass because its almost the same price as a single day pass.It's nice that they have many different attractions here for all ages.There are a lot of animal exhibits where you can interact with the animals and touch them:live sharks, horseshoe crabs, dolphins, penguins, and even the beluga whale.Some are free to touch and others you have to pay a pretty price.They have a lot of entertaining shows that show almost every 1-2 hours.You really have to plan your day if you want to see everything.And also check the shows that are showing on the days that you want to go because they don't show it everyday, and especially in the off seasons like right now, they are under a lot of maintenance so things may be closed.They only have three main rides:The Manta Ray roller coaster - smaller roller coaster with some twists and turnsThe Shipwreck Rapids - water tube raft ride that will absolutely get you wet!and The Journey to Atlantis - roller coaster with a high drop and gets you wet as wellThey also have cafes, cafeterias, and many stands to buy food, drinks and snacks from.And tons of stores to buy souvenirs.They also have a sesame street waterpark for all the younger kids.Overall, it's a great place to go with your family."
627,10/6/2017,5,"Went back to SeaWorld today on my day off :)Got an early lunch there (like always), checked out the garden that seems fairly new and was really cute, went to the freshwater aquarium, and I saw the new Sea Lions Live! show themed around Halloween. While Clyde and Seymour and the Ollie are the stars, Biff is hilarious and one of the best attractions at Sea World. I've seen this show a few times and it seems to be the same guy playing Biff. Some Hollywood agent needs to sign this guy!"
628,6/27/2018,5,"What a refreshing change from other ""theme parks"" ! SeaWorld is truly an educational experience. I appreciated how the animals are treated with respect and kindness. Please don't try to tell me that they are unhappy or enslaved. The trainers explained that the dolphins are exhibiting natural behaviors. When I die, I want to come back as a dolphin. They are having the time of their lives! Don't miss the glass tunnel that goes through the middle of a huge aquarium. The pink flamingos are a glorious sight, too!"
629,5/29/2016,4,"The dolphin show was way better than the one with Shamu. The Pet show was pretty impressive, the cats did tricks! And I logged 9 miles walking around here from 10 something am to 5 something pm. Pretty good for those people with fitbits who need to log miles. The Cirque Del Mar is a lot of fun, with pretty talented folks. That one guy with the jet pack was good!! The hardest thing to do around here was to find a drinking fountain, but apparently water and ice are free. :)"
630,1/2/2016,4,"Visit on 12/30/15: Bring a very warm jacket and even a hat and gloves because it drops to about the high 40s at night in December/January in SD. I also recommend that if you do any of the ""wet"" stuff (splash zone for Shamu shows, Journey to Atlantis water ride, etc) that you bring plastic garbage bags from home and rain boots instead of paying $10 for their blue rain ponchos. Although I did not get to do as much as I would have liked, I am still glad we came here, and especially on a weekday when it is less crowded.*Bayside Skyride: It's a must-do. You go over the water and back, wont get much of a view of the park, only of the Aquarium de la Mer, but it is still fun anyways. We did it twice because there was about a 15-minute wait the first time and about a 5-minute wait at about 6:30pm. *Journey Through the Arctic: Got to see a polar bear, penguins, and other forms of life that live up near the North Pole on this walkthrough. Wished we had done the ride as well. Walkthrough provides a glimpse into what it's like to camp out up there are a researcher. Frigid temperature not simulated, however. : ) Recommend!*Turtle Reef: Many different types of turtles showcased here, including one that has a penguin-shaped nose, and an alligator.*Shark Encounter: Next to Turtle Reef. Cue the Jaws music; yes, you see Great Whites and a few other types that make you wonder ""Why, Grandma, what big teeth you have."" Shark facts, spotlight on different breeds, and the 8-foot fossil of the jaw of a shark that lived during the dinosaur days. Glad it isn't around anymore: the teeth are almost the size of my hand!*Penguin Encounter: Might surprise you to learn that there are several different types of species, and it is a treat to see all these different types interacting together. See if you can spot the physical differences between the breeds!*Flamingos: Never knew how noisy they are until meeting a flock of them face-to-face! For 50 cents, you can feed them, too! Not special feeding hours, just any time of day, can buy food at the dispenser to throw to them. We had fun throwing pellets in the water and watching them scrounge around for them.*Shamu Stadium: Watched the controversial killer whale show ""One Ocean"" and the spectacular ""Shamu Christmas Miracles."" One Ocean is not as trick-sy as animal activists have made it out to be, perhaps in part because the trainers are no longer allowed to go in the water to perform with the animals, and I am glad for that. We slipped in last minute for One Ocean so we had to sit at the very far end, but honestly, sitting in the middle is overrated. We were able to see the animals and trainers just fine; the only drawback might be that you can't see the TV as well, but why watch the TV when you have the animal in front of you? Sitting at the ends also allows for quick exit once the show is over."
631,9/12/2017,5,"Still a family favorite Â and now that our kids are old enough to enjoy the features and the sea life it's that much more enjoyable for us. We enjoy our yearly trip here, Â looking forward to our next visit."
632,7/31/2018,4,"My Husband and I have an annual pass for SeaWorld so we go there many times even on weekdays. Just regular animal watching is okay. Kids might enjoy that more than we do. Animal shows with Orcas, Sea Lions and Dolphins are very nice and worth watching. My favorites are the IllumiNight and Cirque Electrique shows with their acrobatic performances, energetic music and lights. If you plan out your day in advance at SeaWorld, you should be able to see all the shows in a day."
633,8/4/2018,5,"Awesome Theme Park / Educational experience. All the shows are amazing. Short lines for the rides, clean environment, good food. I will definitely be going back next year!"
634,6/19/2017,4,"After seeing Blackfish I sort of hate myself for rating Sea World so highly but this visit changed my mind.We purchased a Go San Diego card which included Sea World and this is the only reason we took our three small children. Â I REALLY wanted to hate Sea World but I was very impressed.The park is very clean. Â They have amusement park type attractions, a wide variety of food selection, and the staff was all very pleasant and helpful. Â The parking was easy and comparable to the prices of other San Diego attractions.The variety of animals was amazing and it was fun to see my landlocked children experience some of this ocean life for the first time. Â The Beluga whales took my breath away. Â  I've never seen such a wide variety of sharks. Â I personally saw animals that were well cared for and handlers that seemed genuinely invested in them. Â  Â When we went the only way to see the Orcas was to wait in line forever and see an Orca show. Â I'd have liked to see them without watching a show. Â I honestly would compare this to 99% of aquariums I've visited but with better exhibit space, more entertainment options, and a better variety of aquatic life."
635,7/2/2018,5,My family and I had such an amazing time here. The atmosphere was so much fun. It was so much to see and do. My little one had so much fun and even the older kids enjoyed themselves. It something fun for all ages. It can be a little pricey but other that it was a great time and we will definitely be go back.
636,7/2/2018,5,It's been a few years since we visited the park. When I was little I would attend their summer camps. Even with much controversy I believe they are doing an amazing job supporting ocean life and educating our children the importance of nature and our earth. We have two kids one 5 year old and one 2 year old. By the time we left our 5 year old was talking about how to keep the ocean clean for all the animals. We can't abolish all zoos we need to continue to educate our children the best we can. I do believe their intention is to take care of their animals and help the ones that are in the wild. Overall our family had a great time and many memories were made. I am also very appreciative of the support they provide to our military.
637,9/7/2017,5,Love coming here with my kiddos! Great rides that keep them entertained and their favorite show is the pet show.
638,10/21/2017,5,Better than Disneyland. Â You rarely wait for a long time for anything and go from show to show and aquarium to aquarium. Â It's so nice not to be on your feet all day and just get to enjoy yourself. Â The staff of nice and the pricing is theme-park-high but not brutal. Â The $20 all day food deal will keep us coming back!
639,7/13/2018,1,They need to hire people who give a crap and not a bunch of stupid disrespectful teenagers only looking for some summer work. I could care less how bad they treat their Wales. But don't treat me or my family with anything short of respect.
640,7/10/2017,5,"I had a family member Â in town and she Â went to sea worldShe was so excited , she forgot her phone , once she was inn she asked for helpAnd Â a lovely lady Jezebel Gomes from FOH MERCHANDISE Â helped her outLet her use her phone to contact me and escort her in and out again .My cousin was highly impressed by the high customer service Â she encountered Well done !"
641,7/5/2018,2,"The last time I visited it wasn't crowded at all however it was obvious that the rides were being loaded slowly & inefficiently to create longer lines. Why? It probably has to do with the fact they they were advertising ""Front of Line Passes"" nonstop to those waiting in the queue. Create long lines to sell more Line cutting passes? Interesting buisness strategy. Explains why none of the rides offer a ""Single Rider"" queue like other parks do. Another ""fishy"" buisness strategy: Rides like ""Manta"" & ""Electric Eel"" require that your bags be stored in a locker which costs $1.00 per hour . Other parks like Universal will give you a free locker for one hour.Also you can no longer interact with the Dolphins at Dolphin point without paying $200+. The Skytower, which used to be free with Admission, now charges $5 per person, per ride. That would be like paying full price admission to visit Disneyland & having to pay extra for a ride.Of you like to be ripped off & encounter scams & ""fishy"" buisness practices, this is the park for you. This was once a fun & amazing park but it has since gone down hill, in upkeep, management, & buisness practices."
642,5/19/2019,2,"Yesterday, 5/18, My family traveled from LA to visit the park. This is the third year we have bought passes because we enjoy Sea World so much; our 7 year old son especially. He's amazed with every animal, big and small, but more so , Sea World Rescue. He loves learning about the animals and Learning how he to can take part in helping save the animals. Yesterday we got in line for the 4 pm show of SeaWorld rescue at the Mission bay theater. As expected our son was excited for this simple show. He started to grow very impatient along with at least 50 other guests when the show did not start at 4pm. Vendors who were selling hats and bubble guns left the area around 4:15 but still no word as to what the delay was about. Finally around 4:20pm we found someone who came over to the theater to see what was going on. She went inside for about 10 minutes, came out; Still , no answers for the few inpatient guests still waiting. Another young lady came over shortly after to let us know ""someone"" would be over in about 10 minutes. A little after 4:30 a woman showed up to let us inside and start the show. My issue is how can such a popular and well known establishment be so unorganized and not even offer an apology or an explanation for wasting so many of their guests time! Instead we got attitude from employees as if they were annoyed by us asking questions about the show and if it will start soon. That's unacceptable. Millions of people plan these trips weeks, months, even years in advance with a very strict itinerary to follow. It doesn't take much effort to offer them an apology, a smile, and a better attitude overall. My family , even just traveling from LA definitely plans out a strict itinerary to ensure that our son gets the most out of every trip. The lack of consideration was just ridiculous."
643,6/17/2018,5,"Swim with a dolphin? See it all by the sea, loads of fun for the family. Duh check it out."
644,7/16/2017,3,"Employees dont even care. They couldnt even call security. There was a guy who went on rides with his older child while his baby was alone in the stroller. Â Other than that, my kids like coming here i have the year pass get it every year."
645,10/20/2015,4,"I'm not a big fan of Sea World and I thought I would definitely boycott it after seeing Blackfish, but our Godchildren had never been to the beach or southern California so we took them to Sea World as well. Â They had a wonderful time and so did the adults. Â It was on a Friday while school was in session and it was slightly drizzling so it was not crowded or hot. Â We were able to walk onto most of the attractions with little or no wait. Â The only disappointing moment was waiting in line for the Journey to Atlantis for nearly an hour without moving only to find out it was out of commission and not available again before the park closed. Â Even though the park officially closes at 5 pm you are able to walk around and shop until 6 pm. Â It looked as though a couple of the rides were still operating as well. Â With fewer crowds you are able to cover a lot in a shorter time than you would during their extended summer hours when the crowds are huge. Â October is a great time to visit San Diego anyway. Â Children under 10 are free for the entire month too.Despite the controversy and harassment from PETA I think Sea World serves as a valuable educational and entertainment venue. Â They do a lot of good especially rescuing and treating wounded, sick or abandoned animals from the wild. Â I was happy to learn that they won their request to expand but disappointed to hear they lost their bid to continue breeding in captivity. Â Hope they are victorious against PETA and can continue their operations undisturbed in So Cal."
646,6/26/2018,3,"I got to go for free with a military pass. Parking was $20 which I didn't mind since I went for free... I might have been annoyed if I had to pay the $100 admission fee. It was pretty crowded but I did go on a Saturday. Most rides had a 45 minute wait which we chose not to wait in. Food wasn't as expensive as I expected. I wish the Orca tank was a lot bigger. It literally looked like a whale parking lot, they didn't have much room to move around. Also the parade in the afternoon made it very difficult to navigate through the park."
647,7/10/2017,3,"When we signed up for membership in November we were told each of us (2adults & 2 children) would be given a free pass to give to someone else on our birthday we could redeem it, so months later we go back with my older son and his best friend and they tell us that they don't have that promotion anymore. It ended in dec. woowwww so why tell us we'd all get a free pass if the promotion only lasted for a month longer. We had to buy a ticket and we weren't expecting to, it was almost an extra $100. Very disappointed.And the signs are not clear so everyone is asking the workers for directions, everyone looks lost."
648,7/2/2018,5,My kids and I had an amazing time despite the long lines at he food places was all worth it. Staff is friendly and will return someday again
649,9/21/2017,5,"This is my favorite theme park. I'm sad that my kid won't see the same Sea World that his parents have seen, but I also understand why changes have to be made.Places like this are a double-edged sword. They do a lot of good, but of course it's still a business- everything costs $$$. I do believe it does help with conservation efforts. Would people care as much about the Orcas if Sea World did not promote them to the general public? Anyway, they revamped the park to have more rides. So, now I think you'll need more than a day to see all the shows and get to all the rides. As usual, every time I visit, Journey to Atlantis is down. Waste of space.I highly recommend to take the kids here rather than your typical theme park, they'll learn something new. Get those inquisitive minds working."
650,10/25/2013,4,"I expect to see an influx of posts from people who watched Blackfish last night on TV, but haven't attended this park recently (if at all).I've been waiting to post my review for this park because of these bloated reviews that are based on a documentary on their orcas, but not the park as a whole.I visited this SeaWorld a few months ago for my anniversary.My boyfriend and I booked an appointment for the Penguin Encounter.The ticket prices, plus gas from LA area, and the package (which is probably the most affordable part), can get pricy.This was an anniversary trip however, so it was a splurge worthwhile.Hiram was who directed our penguin tour.He was personable, informative, and really knew his penguins!He showed us the warmer climate penguins and taught us about them, then took us indoors to see the colder climate penguins.When we were escorted back into the 'behind the scenes' area, M-146 the Macaroni Penguin strutted into the room (by himself).The lady who took over the instructing told our small group that all penguins are asked if they want to participate, and if they don't, they have another take part for the day.After this lady taught us about Macaroni Penguins and their neat feathers and lifespans, we had the chance to meet M-146 one-on-one.*Prior to entering the area we sanitized our shoes and our hands.It was a great experience to touch this penguin after watching him waddle around exploring the blinds and such (he had a fascination with the pull cord).Then we went into the actual colder climate penguin exhibit.They taught us about the different penguin species they have, and their conservation efforts with them.They even have an almost totally blind older King Penguin living in the habitat who is a charmer.You can call his name from across the habitat and he comes waddling through his penguin buddies.This behind the scenes interaction really showed the various bonds the employees have with the penguins here, and I appreciate it.You can tell the penguins love them.I didn't observe zoo behaviors here.When the tour was over, my boyfriend and I watched the Pets Rule! Show.It was awesome!I loved seeing cats, dogs, birds, and even a pig perform.The neat part was that most of the pets were rescues, and you could really see the bond they had with their trainers.Animals need enrichment, and they have it with this show.After that, we explored looking for food, but ended up running into animal ambassadors.There were a few llamas, a porcupine, and a Eurasian Eagle-Owl.All of these animals were casually out for a walk.Their handlers had the time to stop for photos, and educate us on the animals.Now, don't bother coming here for food.It's expensive (like most theme parks), and most of it looked gross.We went to a hut-like area that had salads and typical kids food and it was sitting out.They wanted $8+ for crap.There was a section near the front that had various sodas and displayed teas (but had none).They did however have gluten free snack packs which looked pretty neat, but charged more than Whole Foods.We stopped by the sea lions and I got to feed a few.They can get quite impatient and loudly bark at you.I appreciate the warnings of not dangling fish - because the territorial birds will snatch them from you.It's these type of warnings that are almost obvious, but always a great reminder.*This is why you can't feed dolphins anymore. Having food dishes too close, despite posted warnings caused sea life to go for more - causing injury.We explored the Arctic area and it was mostly under construction.Do yourself a favor and skip the simulated flight.The shark cove was beautiful and hasn't really changed since I was a kid.We didn't go for Shamu or dolphins.They don't even go in the water for Shamu shows anymore for safety/legal reasons.We were more entertained by other things.The Manta Ray rollercoaster looks really cheesy, but isn't.We ended up going on it multiple times because of how fun it was.I really like how advanced it seems with it's design in the beginning with the projections.Not to mention the entire ride queue is probably the most zen queue I've seen at a park yet.Basically, this place is worth checking out even without seeing the orcas or dolphins.It's expensive but worth at least a one-time visit.I highly suggest getting a behind the scenes tour of your favorite animal."
651,6/9/2018,5,"I absolutely love Sea World and so does my toddler. It is a great place to bring young children. And also older kids. There is something for everyone. It is super clean, they have a wonderful play area for toddlers and up (Bay of Play) including children rides- Sesame Street Themed rides, things to climb, bouncy houses and water areas for those hot days when kids want to splash in the water (bring a change of clothes or bathing suit). At Sea World, children can get much closer to seeing the animals like the sea turtles, orcas, dolpins, penguins. For the older kids, there are some pretty rad roller coasters and lots of great entertaining and educational shows. For all the Sea World haters out there, Bite me. Sea World has been a great asset to San Diego and marine life everywhere. Saving, rescuing and rehabilitating mammals for years. I bought the annual pass to Sea World which includes free parking. Children under 3 are free!!!"
652,7/7/2018,3,"There should be enough free cubbies on lines while riding a ride without paying!! It's crazy Â that I need to rent a locker to ride a ride!! Enough money is spent on parking, admission, concessions and shops that this shouldn't be available!!!"
653,1/14/2019,5,It's amazing. I love it. We saw dolphins and whales.and the stuff are really friendly. And their all day dine in deal is amazing !
654,8/21/2017,2,"I used to LOVE SeaWorld, it was so much fun to see the Whale and Dolphin Shows. Â I took my two youngest for the first time and neither of them had much fun with the shows. Â I didn't either. Â It wasn't worth it to sit in the sun and watch any of them. Â The only saving grace for the entire visit was that my youngest was tall enough to get on a few of the rides. Â The shows were lousy now. Â I will not likely spend my heard earned money at Sea World again, it just isn't fun anymore."
655,7/14/2018,4,"Got an annual pass to it. Â My family loves all the rides, especially, ""Electric Eel"" and ""Manta Ray."" Â We also like the shows and being able to see the animals doing tricks. Â Disappointed that they started charging for the ride that takes you straight up high for a 360 degree view of the surrounding area. Â Love the dog and dolphin show."
656,6/27/2018,1,Worst food ever at the Explorers cafe. All fried unhealthy food for outrageous price. No taste to the fish or chicken
657,12/13/2015,4,"This amusement park is really amazing.. 103.7 was hosting a Christmas party and closed down the park, the sea and otter show was really funny and also the shamu show. The exhibits for the shark tank was fun as well as the polar Â bears. Definitely come to seaworld the park is dressed up so well for Christmas and you get to see al the sea life."
658,6/14/2018,2,"I mean its okay. But it used to be so much better. Especially the shamu show, (now called orca something) what was that? It was so boring and not entertaining at all. It is still a fun place for kids and my child did enjoy the experience but for how much it costs, it is not worth it."
659,7/12/2018,5,Steffani B from island market next to ship reck is the best employee they have ! She is sweet and kind and hooked it up! Sea world needs to raise her pay to $15.00!
660,4/29/2017,5,"SeaWorld has made many improvements in the past few years. They are in the process (as of 4/29/17) of creating a new killer whale area which will be bigger and more of a natural setting. Â SeaWorld's conservation efforts and the rescuing program for sick and stranded animals along the coastline are two of the reasons I like to visit. Today we went on a VIP behind the scenes tour where we were able to go inside the penguin exhibit, have a small group experience with dolphins, feed sea turtles and much more. Â It ended with a nice buffet lunch. Â We were seated where we were able to watch the killer whale show. Â The VIP program can be pricey, but it's really a great experience... I highly recommend it."
661,7/11/2018,2,"We love SeaWorld San Diego! There is so much to discover and learn there, and it's pleasant to just stroll around the park, as well. We especially love the shows and exhibits. The rides all seem to be either too kiddie or too thrill for us, so we avoid them. We're not too thrilled about the food at SeaWorld (I've gotten sick twice from it), but since we are San Diego residents, we usually eat before leaving for the Park and maybe get a frappachino and some popcorn for the shows while we're there. Popcorn has never failed me yet. We stopped in one night just to see the Electric Ocean show, but the show's music was extremely loud, so unfortunately, we - as well as a bunch of others in the audience - had to leave without seeing it, since it really hurt our ears. I asked a SeaWorld employee about it, and he seemed to indicate that that was normal for the show. hmm. Too bad. I would have loved to watch it. However, in lieu of the show, we had a nice, peaceful, nighttime walk around the park taking pictures and enjoying the lovely colored lights and decorations.Added as of 7/23/18 - Â Lost two stars for extremely loud amplifiers. Why? Why were the amplifiers/speakers all over SeaWorld San Diego so extremely loud in the evening, Â making it a very unpleasant visit? In some places (walking east towards The Wild Arctic from the entrance) the music even collided from various amplifiers in a terrible cacophony of loud noise. Â WHY DOES SEAWORLD SAN DIEGO THINK WE ARE ALL DEAF OR SHOULD BE DEAF? Are they trying to keep us out of the Park? Are they trying to hurt our children's hearing (and ours)? There is loud and there is too loud."
662,6/23/2018,4,I have not been here in 20 years. We brought our kids and they were offering free tickets for military and teachers (amazing job Sea World). We enjoyed some of the rides and the kids loved the dolphin and sea lion shows.
663,6/22/2017,3,"FAIR WARNING: SWIMMING WITH DOLPHINSIts $200 for an ""interaction"". You barley get to even touch them. You get 1 ride that last 5 seconds. Only some of the people in the group get to hold the dolphins fin. I understand they are animals and not house pets animals but I felt like we didn't get enough for the price.The viewing area for family who want to take pictures is SOOO far away. You have to look up over rocks or bushes. They have photographers right up close though to get great pictures. They make it so that you feel like you have to buy one of their photos because you couldn't even get one for yourself and for $200 I want at least 1 picture. Rest of the park was a blast! Shows were great!"
664,7/8/2018,4,I like that you can always find discount tickets or coupons to Sea World. Â The children section of the park is fun and cool. Â Love the sea animals.
665,10/8/2015,5,"We ended up here haphazardly. We ended up driving to San Diego for the weekend and were planning on going kayaking, but when we woke up it was raining :(There's shows, rides, and cute animals! And Dippin' Dots!!!The dolphin show must have been my favorite. Keep your video ready, because they open with a guy riding two dolphins, Poseidon style. And the dolphins jump out of the water at the end :)Beware of the wet zone, I warned you, people. I warned you.The rides are pretty fun too, I believe there's 4 of those, and some do go pretty fast. The rafting ride closes early, so make sure to visit that early. They have blow dryers for you to dry yourself off afterwards.You can buy some tiny fishies to feed the sea lions (beware of the birds, they WILL attack you if you take too long).The aquariums are beautiful and they let some penguins hang out outside.They also have a pond thing where you can try stick your hand and have the fish eat your dead skin cells, which kinda freaked me out, so we skipped that part for sanitary reasons :)Did I mention freaking sea lions that just jump to you to get the fish?!Pro tip: Buy the tickets online, they're cheaper even if you buy them the same day"
666,12/11/2016,1,"I want to send this comment to the Human Resources department or the CEO also Â General Manages Sea Word Â San Diego CA Â to complain about the service of the woman MANAGER DINE WITH SHAMU PARTS yesterday 12/10/2016 - 5:30 PM . Â  Â Yesterday we and my Â family come Â from Vietnam to visit Sea Word San Diego, I arrived at 12:30 pm and we bought Â 3 ticket Â $ 279.00 + $ 129.60 for 3 ticket Dine With Shamu 5:30 PM- Â , before buying Â the ticket i was Â request women Â that I'd like to reserve a good table in the middle section Â with a clear view because my eyes Â did not look away from riskand she say ok we have the good table and good view but after Â Shamu Show 3:30 pm end we and my family wait over 1:30 hours when we check in the women outside Â was give me TABLE 1 , the table end of the left section and this section only my table , we try talk with manager it the young lady but she don't do anything help me , she say the middle section somebody was resed from 1 week ago but after 15 minute from start Â too much table empty Â . She talk with customer not nice and very rule , i think maybe she look we are Asian people so she disregard and unfaird because some Â customer come after me but everybody also have good table in the right section , only my table in the end left section , section middle after 15 minute from start it empty . Â  Â  Feel profoundly hurt after 3 attempts Â offered to help and try to dealt with very rule and very bossy manager but no results, so we are forced to cancel dinner . The problem is in that we came here to visit we're not come here to be despised and treated so unfairly. I really do not understand why a place like San Diego Sea Word has a bossy attitude manager and want to dispel such customers. Â  Â Our come from a far Â but too disappointed with service of some staff here as woman manager of Diner With Â Shamus yesterday . I thought I would not come back here again because of the many places to visit more polite ."
667,11/4/2017,4,"Seaworld is a nice place to see underwater animals. Not much to do since it's under construction right now. Left out one star because of parking, you have to pay, unlike the zoo where it's free. Not too many shows going on but an overall nice place. Shipwreck rapids is a great ride but beware you will get wet!"
668,7/7/2018,1,"I'm at San Diego SeaWorld right now and I can tell you that it is the WORST themepark experience I have ever had in my life. Seriously understaffed, no ice available at the beverage purchase stations (on an unseasonably hot summer day), and cash registers that were malfunctioning (necessitating having to find another cash register that worked and then being confronted with extraordinary lines waiting to be processed). I cannot recommend this place to anyone who might be in the San Diego area. If you're planning a vacation here, cross Sea World off your list. Don't bother! PS: Just walked out of Calypso Bay Smokehouse due to extraordinary wait time in line. Done; we are now leaving."
669,4/5/2018,2,Don't recommend this place. Save your money. Â Very dingy and run down. Â Go to the Safari Park if you want to see animals that have been rescued.
670,11/21/2015,3,"We got a deal on Sea World passes this year and it had been years since we went. Â So, we've been twice so far, most recently last night for the member night for the Christmas preview. Â Here's the thing. Â I like Sea World and there are some great exhibits. Â The Turtles aquariums and the Penguins are some of my favorites. Â But I've found that I'm less excited by the shows than I once was. Â They feel a little tired and hokey.The Christmas lights and decor were really pretty and the Christmas/Santa installations were fine, but kind of felt geared towards adding more ways to get folks to spend money. Â I know... that's what they are there for, but whatever.Overall, it's Sea World, its an amusement park. Â There are some fun parts and some meh parts, but we got a great deal at Costco for the tickets, so I'm going to enjoy this year and get as much out of our memberships as we can. Â I'm definitely going to try to hit the less crowded days because last night was pretty darn packed for a special event! Â I'm still wishing they'd have a special event for just adults. How much fun would Sea World be without tripping over strollers and wagons!?!?! Â I'll keep dreaming."
671,7/11/2016,4,"We've been to the SeaWorld in Texas so my husband and I decided to see what this one is like. I LOVE how they support our military and their families!We got there on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. The first thing we saw were the awesome Cledner Fish! We were there for like 15 mins lol if you go, you'll see why. It's so cool. After that we walked around and even caught a few shows. The shows were great. Fun and hilarious. The only bad part is that if it's a sunny day, you're basically baking on the bleachers. We ended up eating there too at the Calypso Bay Smokehouse and got the The Sampler Chicken, Brisket, Ribs. Not the best I've ever had, but it was good. The prices are pretty high, but that's expected. We stayed until 8:30pm and then walked back to the car to see the fireworks from there at 8:50pm. That way, soon as they were done we drove out without any traffic.The fireworks litetally only last for 5 minutes. But it's still nice though. Overall, Â It was a really nice day."
672,7/4/2018,3,"Just FYI they're now charging for the sky tower and sky rail.Their maps still say included with admission ticket. NOT! Unless you're an annual member you don't pay but that doesn't include the ""fun card.""Sea World 5$ is a bit much,I get the overpriced food and gifts but after years of Â including it you should keep those free."
673,7/3/2018,5,"A trip to Seaworld is a great experience. It is so fun to see all of the sea animals. My favorite was the illuminated night time Cirque show. The trapeze act was spectacular! Also, the jet skis and acrobats were excellent. It was a very well done performance! I got a season pass so I can go often."
674,6/30/2017,2,"I remember Sea World in the 80s, and it has changed a lot. Â Specifically, I'm talking about the shows. Â About 8-10 years ago, I noted that the Orca show had been significantly neutered, but there was always that exciting dolphin show. Â I went this week, and now the dolphin show is weak (NOOOOOO!!!!!). To top it off, it was lead and narrated by a gal (Jesse) whose voice sounded just like Kerri Strug(!). Â In both shows, they spent more than 50% of the time virtue signaling during the narration. Â Clearly, this is a result of that documentary. Â The PETA folks won't care and neither do the regular folks (ok, maybe we care for about 10 seconds, but not a second more). Â I found this constant virtue signaling quite annoying, and boring. Â Additionally, the earth worship/preaching sounded like the script was written by Al Gore and, that too, became very tiresome/boring -- my children were actually getting bored. Â Put some testosterone back into the show (btw, where are the male trainers?), and show us what these beast can do like what you used to do in the 80s. Â You're never going to make the PETA crowd happy, screw Â them. Â But if you continue with these effeminate shows, park attendance will continue to drop -- it was notably empty for summer time.Props to Manta and Atlantis. Â Shark encounter is cool as well.That said, I'm in no hurry to go back.Update: I saw the movie Blackfish. Â Management at Sea World are morons. Â I was always under the impression that these were rescued whales/dolphins. Â See the movie."
675,5/14/2018,3,"Get there at opening time for the rides, unless standing in line for at least an hour on a relatively quiet day (Mother's Day) is your idea of good value per ride.The attractions are good. Orca, dolphins, beluga whales, penguins, walrus, sea lions, rays, small sharks available for petting.. Great stuff for the kids to have a fun experience with.It gets better though - the kids play area is fantastic. Arguably the star of Sea World. If walking around the park isn't enough to wear everyone out, the play area certainly will work for the kids. They really thought this one out. It's got everything. As for food, this is partly where the stars are lost. It appears Sea World are taking the easy way out with their culinary offerings. If you prefer not to eat food which has been generously processed, packed with salt, starch and sugar, I would suggest bringing your own food. Take the sky tram for a lovely view. It's free and a bit bumpy upon re-entry (which I liked), but worth the 15 minute wait, not least to get away from very worst thing about the Sea World experience - the endless assault on our ears. There are outdoor speakers everywhere. It's loud, distorted and obnoxious. Maybe someone convinced Sea World it'll have a positive effect on their visitors, and their likelihood of returning soon, or spending more money in the gift shops. Maybe it does have that effect on some people, but it'll keep me away for a good while. It's mostly corny fanfare music, or the kind of soundtrack you would expect to hear when watching a scene in a kid's movie where a the inventor's flying boat takes-off into the sunset with his previously disinterested sweetheart who has suddenly fallen under his spell. $20 to park. Make of that what you will."
676,12/8/2018,5,Great local fun at a good price. Reliable service. Rides are kid friendly.
677,4/30/2018,5,"Love SeaWorld. Another fantastic family vacation. Looking forward to returning soon!! Â Slightly disappointed the shows have changed over the years but I can't imagine what they are up against and if that is what they feel is best then they still have my support 100%. The park is clean, employees are friendly and helpful. Food and gift shops have good choices. Makes for a great memory!! Thank you SeaWorld for everything you do!!"
678,6/22/2018,4,"Not much to do! Kids we took were 5 and 10 yr olds. I think teenagers would be bored after 2 hours there. We went on a Thursday during summer vacation. The wait time for the attractions are all less than 30 min. Â One thing is DO NOT BUY the ""front of the line pass"" for the kids area. They never even acknowledged it and there's not more than a 5 minute wait. It was a waste of money for our family. Make sure you buy the ""all day dining"" it's worth the money."
679,7/1/2018,5,"Always love this place, rides are fun but, pay the coins in the machine next to the raft ride and spray the people wet. Just prepare to get sprayed also. All in all, my son can go over and over."
680,1/14/2016,4,"I have not been to Sea world in a long long time, but they do have a roller coaster, but did not get to ride it :( Â But they had other rides as well I wanted to try out, but I know I went with family so they would have advised me not to go which is okay. Â I did like the Atlantis the ride and wanted to ride again, but it was okay. Â I liked seeing the polar bears and whales, the rare ones which is nice. I did like penguins as well. Â The prices were okay, but can not believe retail is $86 dollars, but got a $20 dollar discount when ordering online. Â The food is okay as there were limited choices. Â I liked that we were able to pile up the salad which was good and a lot more. Â The shows were cheasy, but did not like that they were advertising how they were treating the animals and how well they were doing. Â I guess they were covering the bad stuff that happen."
681,12/6/2015,4,"Beautiful Christmas decorations, interesting shows. The park staff were very friendly with questions and guidance for shows. Holiday crowds everywhere, be prepared for show times and rides."
682,12/22/2016,3,"As crowded as this place is, you would think they would have kiosks to purchase your tickets at the front. They have machines to redeem your tickets previously purchased online, but not to buy them. Expect to wait a long while to buy tickets. We purchased our tickets in advance and didn't realize the date on them was for 2017. There wasn't anyone in the customer service office either so we spent about an hour trying to find out our options were. In the end I had to buy tickets all over again.We went in October so two of our kids got in for free. Parking was a pain in the butt. Get there early or you will end up walking pretty far out. There is also a preferred parking area for an extra cost. It wasn't explained to us very well when we arrived to the park or we would have paid the extra cash. There should also be more staff members once you enter to direct patrons and answer their questions. There was a random worker who happened to pass by. I know she was flustered because she was bombarded with questions. Heck, I asked her questions too! She was the only one around to ask.I hadn't been here in 20 years and was amazed by all the stuff to see. The place is one big maze and we didn't have time to see everything. The food here is VERY expensive. We spent over $100 on pizza for the 5 of us. We read online that outside food was not allowed. When we went in we saw people with Jersey Mike's, and all kinds of food. The pizza we did get lacked flavor, didn't have much cheese or sauce, and was on the dry side. Our french fries weren't that great either. Not all of the seating outside is covered so we rushed through our meal so as not to get wet from the rain.I was also disappointed to see that there were only 2 lactation rooms. This was not thought through very well. It takes about half an hour to nurse, and I waited a good while to get into one of the rooms. I wish there were more rooms. It's crowded here and I really hate to nurse in public.The dolphin show was probably our favorite. The kids liked that we could go up to see the whales through the glass. That was cool. The walk back to the car. Not as cool. Next time we'll consider the eating and drinking packages. All in all we know what to do and what not to do for next time."
683,7/6/2017,4,"We visited on this independence day weekend 2017 and found this to be great place to visit with kids and family. Some shows like dolphin, illuminight were awesome. Sea otter and dolphin ponds were also good and greatly enjoyed by children. Overall its a must go place if you happen to be in san diego and haven't been to any sea world before. Only disappointing thing in the park is that it greatly lacks clear instructions/direction sign boards to walk from one place to another. This adds too much confusion while moving from one slide/show to another specially with tired kids. They did put some hoardings on place to place but those are not sufficient for guiding a person clear and loud (like something in San Diego Zoo where its so clear on each junction). I remember in the night while trying to exit with my son sleeping in the lap, we kept looking for Exit but it took 20-25 minutes to actually find it (and by the way later we realized that we passed by exit 2-3 times). Similarly parking doesn't have Exit sign boards on all places and was confusing that where to exit from."
684,8/6/2017,3,"My boyfriend and I and his family all decided to make a trip to San Diego sea world while we were in Oceanside. I doubted we would be there for long, because I didn't think there'd be much to do. I was wrong! We were there for a good chunk of the day. We paid for a ticket that included free food every hour throughout the day at the park. I have to say, the food wasn't very good. I ended up only using that perk once for lunch, and the rest for drinks, like bottled water. I was happy to see some rides, because the last time I went years ago, they didn't have any at the park. So that was fun for the family to all join in and do. We went in July, and there were hardly any lines at any of the rides which a great bonus. I wouldn't go back anytime soon, because once you've gone once, that's all you need to see."
685,5/27/2018,4,Always have such a good time here. Love being able to feed some of them and I absolutely loved all the succulents and plants they've planted. It's so beautiful. I recommend getting the all day dining deal because even if you just do snacks and one meal you end up spending more money. I got the teacher pass and so thankful that they have that. My cousins and I had a blast. Definitely will be back later this year.
686,11/14/2016,1,"I used to love this place but coming here as an adult, I look at it with different eyes.Animal welfare? I have some prime examples that some where ignored.1) Touch pools: horseshoe crab.This is one of the first things you see entering the park and in the pool, there were 2 crabs attached to each other and flipped onto their backs. no movement. I watched for at least 15 mins while the worker just walked around, saying nothing, doing nothing about the crabs.Flash forward to leaving the park, at least 6 hours later, the crabs were in the same position. I was quite positive then that they were definitely dead.2) giant sea turtles exhibit. One of the sea turtles was obviously distressed. He was continuously biting and trying to consume the plastic coral decor in the tank. For 10 minutes, I watched them gnaw at their plastic coral plant. A mother saw that I was distressed about it and she even mentioned the horseshoe crabs I had seen previously. I'm not the only one who was concerned. 3) Dolphin and whale show: The gate for the dolphin pen during the show malfunctioned and did not work. What does this mean for the dolphins? I think that they didn't even check the gate because they don't let these poor creatures out on the regular! I went back for the second show to make sure the gate would open and nope, it was still not working! Instead, they transferred the dolphins into a smaller pool. At least, the dolphins had an alternate route to the exit that area.Another thing that bothered me is that they didn't even bother to take down signs for areas they no longer service, aka food carts and shops. Seeing signs for far away and coming up to a cart that no longer service THE ONE ITEMS I WANTED ALL DAY really put a damper on my day... farewell, funnel cake fries. I'm sorry I was never able to meet you.FOOD! disgusting, sad theme park food and super over-priced. The pizza was worse than the microwave pizza I make myself at home. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? It was worse than what they serve in elementary school! You know that bagel pizza? Yeah, even that was better.The pasta was bland and served in a chinese to-go box. At the bottom, there was a pool of leftover pasta water mixed with diluted pasta sauce... I made the grave mistake of tasting it. It was like tasting dish water.... Did I mention that chicken had a tan/grey color to it? NO! NOOOOOOOOOO! not safe. I immediately drank some probiotics. Lord knows what that really was. *shivers*never EVER going back. Even with getting 4 tickets FREE from the Veteran's program, I wouldn't be back!"
687,8/10/2017,5,Great place to take the family. I enjoy the exhibits and the shows. Where else can you have your kids run around a netted bridge and then turn around and teach them about marine life? Remember to take a look at the show schedule ahead of time to map out your visit for the day.
688,8/1/2015,3,"I think this place would be more fun if I were still a kid. There are various stadium to go with shows lasting about 20 min. I went to the Shamu stadium and saw some killer whales do some tricks. It was cool. There's a soak zone there which is the first 6 or 7 rows so if you're sitting there, prepare to get wet. There's no shading available so DEFINITELY bring sunscreen, a huge sun hat, or an umbrella. I learned this the hard way with sunburn and a really bad tan. I also went to the the cirque del mar stadium and saw a few acrobats doing their thing. The show was alright. They picked someone in the audience as their ""chosen one"", so if you're not shy, try to get picked because he got to go on their jetski and be a part of the whole show! All the rides are free which is such a relief--and surprising. I went on the skytower which overlooked the whole Sea World and it spun so you got a 360 view of it all. I also went on the Bayside Skylift which was my favorite. Very serene an calming, and a cool down from the summer heat. There's flamingos that you can feed for 50 cents. There's also sea lions and seals you can feed for $5 per fish tray. I went to the Artic Zone and saw a polar bear, and went on this stimulated helicopter ride into the Antartic. It was okay. Bring suncreen and hats. Parking is also expensive AF...$16! There are a couple roller coasters and a couple water rides where you get soaked but the lines were atrocious. There's this huge kids playground which adults can accompany their kids in. Overall, not a bad place to take the kids. Definitely a place you need to go to if you're a local---at least once!"
689,8/8/2017,5,I absolutely loved this place!!! Â I came to SD with my bf (we drove from LAX during rush hr traffic) 2.5 hr drive! When visiting in the summer wear shorts and thin tops. There are a few water rides and with thin clothing you'll dry fast!I most definitely plan on visiting again and participating in the dolphin interaction program!!! We bought a wristband ($35) each. Â We were allowed to enjoy food from the 6 dining locations every hour.
690,8/26/2018,1,"Super disappointed in the ""new improved"" Seaworld. They have some new policies that are can are discriminatory and unfair. First, the Manta ride now no longer allows people to stow backpacks in a area just before getting on the ride - you must now pay for a locker. Many people bring backpacks with them to the park so now they need to pay. But the real issue is that women are no longer allowed to bring their purse with them - again YOU MUST PAY for a locker to store your purse. True it is only $1 but 90% or more of the women that come here have purses. Why should they DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN!?! This is a totally sexist policy. A man carrying his wallet in his pocket does not have to pay extra to ride this ride. The issue is the lockers for this ride used to be free but the new rule now means you must stow your purse AND pay to ride. The money grab goes beyond this as they now charge to ride the Bayside Skyride if you are not a pass holder. I AM a pass holder and I know this is an unfair policy unless you tell people when they buy the ticket they have to pay extra. I know Seaworld is trying to re-brand and have a better image - this is NOT the way to do it. I seriously need to reconsider being a pass holder."
691,1/29/2018,2,"This could easily be a 5 stars but I have to make a few things clear. Â We were there in the off season. Â Sounds good right? Â Less people mean more fun for us. Â Not so much. Â It was like a ghost town. Â We were thankful we picked lunch with the Orcas or we could go hungry. Â Not many of the outside food options were open. Â Not much of anything was open. Â Two of the major rides were down for repairs, we could hear the construction guys yelling profanities at each other way up in the air. Â Enjoyed the 2 shows quite a bit and our daughter actually got to swim with the dolphins (we paid for it of course) so that was the only thing to save this from a zero stars. Â She enjoyed that quite a bit and we loved to see her smile. Â The big kicker was since so much was down or closed, why can't you reduce the price of the daily ticket? Â Lot of money for such little reward."
692,9/30/2017,5,"It's seaworld! Â Staff was awesome, shows were great, socks got soaked! Â Only bummer is they charge $6 to use the driers! Â Now it's cool they have driers, but that's crazy price. Otherwise was awesome!"
693,7/29/2015,4,"I found a sweet 2 day park visit deal and was so excited to come back after almost 10 years since I last visited!Unfortunately, we never ended up coming back for the second visit, but wifey and I had a great time and ended up attending most of the shows on our first visit. The park itself was still very clean, and all of the shows were great! The only bad part about the day was when the register went out at dip n dots and the cashier was so rude about it!I do remember when I was younger that they had a show near the bay where a guy on a bicycle would ride from the top of their set and would make it all the way down and it was AMAZING! Sadly, one of the employees told me they discontinued that show a few years ago :( While we did had a good time, we're not sure how soon we'll be back..."
694,12/7/2018,2,"We went on a Monday after Thanksgiving. Â All the employees were rude, the ones we could find anyway. Â Most everything was also closed. Â I went to go breastfeed in the mother's room and the room had no circulation and it smelled like poop. Â Couldn't find any employees to ask to clean it, then I found one, she told me to keep looking for a janitor as she had no way of telling anyone it needed servicing. Â Very dissatisfied."
695,6/18/2018,2,"Please please please go over food healthy and safety with your staff! We were here yesterday for Father's Day with a large group. We found hair in our food at 2 different restaurants. The second time we found it before taking the tray off of the heated counter, brought it to staff's attention, and watched them remove the hair from the food and replace it back up on the counter. People are going to end up sick from your food if better care is not taken by your staff. Not to mention it's just gross."
696,2/8/2016,3,"Disappointed.I've never been to SeaWorld and so when they had the promotion for free admission for people born in the year of the Monkey I trekked down here from LA to go with a few of my friends. It was very underwhelming. From the moment I walked in I had high expectations of really cool animals, fun attractions and great rides. The animals were cool. They're definitely more active than the ones you see at the SD Zoo. The attractions are okay. The only one I liked was the Acrobats of Hebei and that was a special time attraction. The Shamu one was really sad. I was at the edge of my seat waiting for something awesome to happen and then the announcer said enjoy the rest of your day and thank you for coming to SeaWorld (or something along those lines) and I was so sad. The show was over...but I didn't even think it started yet. Out of all the rides that day, only three were open..."
697,8/9/2017,4,"I would give them a (5), but the parking is a joke.....It took us over (45) minutes fromarrival to parking. The time while inside the park was GREAT....but no more SHAMOSHOW, however, the other show were FUN. The weather and crowds were light andthe people working were OK."
698,4/8/2017,5,"My favorite place in san diego. Â I got my wife and i season passes, along with the season dining. I am here 3-4 times a week. You can't beat the value. $25 a month for both passes. $160 for two dining plans. The staff is always so nice!! I have never had a bad experience with anyone. I would go as far as saying every experience has been delightful. I am so efficient at the lines for food. Maybe a suggestion would be to have a special line for pass members. Drive me nuts how slow customers are at deciding what they want. Not the staffs fault. Two times our season dining did not work. It said we used our entitlements for the day, but we 100% did not. The staff was great in taking care of us!"
699,12/15/2018,2,"My family had the opportunity to go to Sea World. Â We were so disappointed. Â We haven't been since they've had to change the Killer Whale show. Â Although the show was very informative about the whales, it was a little on the boring side. Â We ate at the Shipwreck Restaurant. Â It was so dark inside, the food was very expensive, and wasn't good at all. Â The whole park seemed like it needed a good scrubbing. Â The park employees we dealt with were nice, but did not seem like they enjoyed their job at all. Â I know Sea World is no Disneyland, but I think they need try a little harder. Â We haven't been to Sea World in a few years, but most shows haven't changed since the last time we visited. Â Needless to say, we will not be going back to Sea World."
700,5/13/2018,4,"This was my first visit to Seaworld San Diego since my wife and I went together in 2003. Fast forward to Aoril 2018 and we brought our little man who is 10 years old and we had a blast. There is so much to do and see that you literally cant experience it all in one day. There are plenty of rides and attractions for all ages. Plus, the weather is beautiful and it just makes for a nice day out in San Diego. I only gave four stars because the park is not as clean as it was in prior visits 2003 & 1991. Don't get me wrong its not trashed by any means I guess the park is just showing its age. We are going to become annual pass members. We live in Phoenix but we have family in Oceanside and they have annual passes as well and young kids too Â so it will definitely be worthwhile."
701,2/19/2017,4,"Sea world....What's there not to love? Oh yeah, that part where they stopped the orca show because of the stupid movie. Sea World takes care of marine animals and do not abuse them. The next generation will not be able to experience the show. *end of rant"
702,12/13/2018,3,"it's okay for the most part. food isn't the greatest though & rides constantly breakdown. i think they need to update the park majorly, especially rides. shows are good though, a little cheesy but it is sea world. some of their tanks & exhibits (penguin for example) can be a little dirty at times. all year is pass is pretty cheap for a monthly payment & parking is free so that's cool. i think we're going to cancel our all year pass and switch to knotts."
703,6/21/2018,2,"We loved the park, the shows and rides were great! But I do have a problem with the alcohol being served throughout the park. Seen several instances that were unbelievable! Â People holding tall beers and Â putting there little kids on rides. After dark the places was a zoo! More drunk than not! This does not seem safe or family friendly! Very dissappointed!!!"
704,6/13/2018,1,"If you're looking for a food recommendation at SeaWorld San Diego, do not buy the all you can eat day pass for food. CafÃ©, the six who honor the wristband, open late and close early! We never dreamed we would end up leaving the park hungry."
705,4/16/2016,5,AMAZING!!!!!!! All these mammals and animals are so trained and smart.. Especially the Shamu whale... I love this place... I just didn't like that it closed at 730 on a Saturday.. Other then that I will make good use of our one year pass... I bought 7 tickets and only paid $170 to all get in and did monthly payments.. Cool.. Why not!!!! Gotta say it again... AMAZING whales and animals.. Smarter then most people I think...
706,5/6/2015,4,"Oh Seaworld, how you have had a bad rep because of Blackfish. But I still don't think so. I try to think of the educational aspect that Seaworld offers. I used to have a year pass, but now that I feel a little older and don't have any kids, I would just spend my money on FOOD! But not the food here! Holy cow, the turkey leg is almost $15!I haven't been here in over 8 years and some of the park still looks the same but they did add some cool educational interactive pools for the kids. Which I think is awesome!"
707,9/10/2018,1,"My grandsons 1st visit to Sea World. We decided to make it a group trip because we wanted to get on the rides and figured we would trade off watching the baby since he is too small to get on the rides. We decided to make reservations for dinner with Elmo...my grandson loves Elmo. While dining with Elmo my son discovered a dead fly in his salad!!!! DISGUSTING!! My son brought the salad to a server/hostess to let her know there is a fly in my salad, you may want to replace that bowl of salad at the buffet. The server took the plate of salad with the fly on it and never came back???? Ok? Hello?? Where did you go? And arent you going to remove the salad from the buffet station? Too hungry to enjoy ourselves, Â we ended up leaving the park. On the way out we stopped by guest services and they refunded the dining with Elmo cost.. ok cool...but what about our entry tickets? They arent cheap.. and we weren't looking for a cash refund, but what about, "" here are some tickets for another day, I apologize, come back and give us another try"". Â We didnt even get an apology, shoot the girl never came back!!! Oh and what's even more insulting, I called to file a Â complaint, and let Sea World Â know about this horrible experience, and the ""manager"" said well you got your money back for the dinner, there is nothing else we can do.. I said yes the money was refunded but our experience was ruined. We paid for general admission and only stayed an hour or so, we didnt get what we paid for. He said you chose to leave, I said yes because we were hungry. Â  We made plans to eat at sea world, but after you find a fly in your salad and no one does anything about it, and tries to hide what happened, how can we trust the food served at sea world? He said you could have left the park to eat and came back. Yes we could have, but why ? That's the reason we made reservations to eat at the restaurant, so we didnt have to leave the park. Sure mr manager, inconvenience us, because there was a fly in the salad u served to us? Horrible customer service. Not an ounce of empathy. He did nothing to try and turn this awful experience around. If anything he made it worse by showing me he didnt give a crap about what we went through that day, and that my family and I arent valued guest. Â Seaworld invest in customer sensitivity training. Guest always remember how they are treated and good experiences keep them coming back."
708,8/8/2017,1,"The website for purchasing tickets is absolutely horrible. You click a link and it says ""oops try again"" or ""505"" or any number of errors. Then it looses your order. And then it emails you an hour later asking if you want to continue. But when you click to continue it says it doesn't know what you want. And when you restart your order it can't figure out what you want to do. And then it requires you to create an account to pay for a ticket. But gives you a default ""oops"" error when you click continue so you don't know if you filled out the page correct or what. You do nothing...click ""continue"" again and it works. It's like a lotto when you get to the next step.Absolutely horrible.Update After Visit....Parking entrance is mass chaos. They need some ex-Disneyland employees to help them figure it out. The VIP and UpFront parking isn't worth the money.The park itself is small and very nice. Â Beautiful landscaping and easy to get where you want to go. If not for the online purchasing of a ticket and the poor parking entrance it's a wonderful day."
709,4/3/2018,5,So pretty and we love coming here. Better than Disneyland. No lines and affordable. Our kiddos were entertained the whole time and it was clean!!
710,6/6/2017,1,So disappointed that I believed their lies about the killer whale's dorsal fin. The only fun that I didn't feel guilty for having in my long history of visits to sea world was the rays exhibit. They were a lot of fun to feed.
711,9/9/2015,5,"You all complain about the animals being held captive there while you own cats, dogs, fish, lizards, etc. It's so pathetically hypocritical. Sea World does A LOT of conservation work. The fact that so many people jumped on this propaganda of hating Sea World without doing any real research is so ignorant. I can't wait for this to end. Get over it and think about how your own animals must ""feel"". They can't be happy in your house right? According to own logic, you're a terrible person.ANYWAY, I want to SeaWorld for my birthday on August 8th and it was amazingly fun. The park was very clean and the prices for things inside were surprisingly fair. I love seeing all the animals and especially lost it when I saw the baby whale, it was the cutest thing ever. My husband and I got in for free because they were having a military family special, I can't wait to go again. It was nice of them to support our military!(: We got there in the morning before it was crowded and saw every single animal we could. Feeding the seals and petting the sting rays was a blast! The polar bears, walruses, penquins, ect. were in specially chilled inclosers, which I thought was really nice. I loved every second being there.!"
712,5/7/2015,5,"Know before you go: Tickets and Passes : The FUN Card reasonably priced but it doesn't include parking(parking fee is approx $15), check the black-out dates before you head out.Annual Passes include free parking.Dining:The dining options are at Shipwreck Reef CafÃ©, Calypso Bay Smokehouse, Mama Stella's Pizza Kitchen, for coffee and baked good Seaside Coffee and Bakery is best, deserts at Funnel cakes.Dine with Shamu and Elmo & friends is very expensive and not worth the price according to us, just a personal opinion, because you already watch the Shamu up close during the Shamu shows.The Rides: Manta(The high speed roller coaster), Journey to Atlantis(The splashy adventurous ride), Shipwreck Rapids, Sky tower, Riptide Rescue, Wild Arctic Ride, Bay side Skyride. Our favorite and adventurous ride is the "" Journey to Atlantis"" but get ready to get wet in the splash and also the Bay side skyride is just an awesome, relaxing skyride! don't miss it.The Shows: The daily shows change and there are special shows, events during the holidays, Halloween, Christmas etc so always check for the schedule for shows, events for that day.Our favorite show is the Shamu Christmas Miracle, Clyde & Sea More shows, Pets Rule!Tip: As soon as you enter the park, collect the park info, park map and Most important the special shows/ exhibits/fireworks schedule for that day, so that you can plan your visit appropriately and select your favorite shows and their timings and plan it well. This has always been very helpful for us. Travel light!Overall is a great entertainment for kids, and the whole family and fun place to be in."
713,8/6/2018,1,"What the heck. I came here with my band to perform when I was younger and now I invited my family to come out and visit with me. I measured my niece at the front gate to make sure she was tall enough to get on the rides before I purchased my tickets. I seen she was the appropriate height 42"" to ride with an accompanied adult. So we went to go on shipwrecked and tell me why the height chart is all of a sudden different like no matter what 42"" is 42 fucking inches soooo I don't understand because it's not math it's height yet she couldn't go on? We had to leave the park because there wasn't much she could go on after I checked and double checked to make sure. I still don't understand how 42"" switches from station to station???? Oh! Plus on top I bought a souvenir cup ($10) free refills. It was sooooo hot!!!! There was no ice anywhere and when I did ask someone for ice they said they couldn't give me ice because there was little ice. And to top it all off on the fountain drinks they were like swarmeddd I mean legit covered in bees and I'm allergic. They didn't even have water so it really wasn't an investment. But whatever I guess lesson learned."
714,10/12/2016,4,"The kiddos have always loved the whales and sealife so they had a great time.It is a bit expensive, but watching their faces light up is so worth it.The dolphin show was pretty cool and the whales are awesome."
715,9/14/2018,1,I read all the reviews here and I'm like what park they went to? This place is so depressing to watch this beautiful intelligent whales in such small captivity. And the shows are so lame such a waste of time and money. My kids didn't enjoyed it. Definitely not coming back.
716,7/12/2015,3,"I wanted to come to Sea World before watching Blackfish so I could remain ignorant and enjoy the day with my wife and kids without feeling upset or guilty. Â Wise move. Â Still haven't seen the movie, but I have to say, I enjoyed SeaWorld. Â I think everything is different when you experience it with your own kids and watch them experience the wonder of it, and my kids are still talking about it nearly 3 months later! Â We came on a Sunday morning and the park was not busy at all. Â It got a lot more packed as the day went on though. Â Shows are entertaining for the kids even though I couldn't wait for them to be over. Â I'm also not into the whole getting soaked thing so we sat as high up in the bleachers as possible and close to electronic equipment just to make sure we wouldn't get wet. Â I liked the Polar Bear, Turtles, and Shark exhibit. Â Food was awful. Â We had what was supposed to be pizza but tasted more like cardboard with some cheese and I can't possible classify the sauce as pizza sauce as it really couldn't have been. Â Even the garlic bread sticks where sort of limp and tasteless.The rides looked pretty fun, but since I have a 5 and 2 year old, I couldn't do any of them except the one where you sit in the gondola and go over the sea. Â Loved that ride. Â Great view of San Diego's coastline.Without having seen the movie yet, I can appreciate the concept of SeaWorld as it is very educational for kids to see the animals up close and not just in pictures in a book. Â Hopefully it continues a love for exploring and learning."
717,7/4/2015,5,"My family and I have been longtime ""Loyal"" and I do repeat, ""Loyal"" customers of Seaworld San Diego for Over a Decade... Even while many abandoned Seaworld in light of recent bad publicity surrounding the Documentary Black Fish. Â My family and I have continued to frequent your park and bring as many friends and family with us in the process. Â We have since become advocates of all the positives that Seaworld has to offer utilizing many social media tools such as Yelp, Facebook, Twitter, and of course Instagram. Â We feel spreading the news of the many rescues and rehabilitations that are a direct result of Seaworlds efforts will overtime reverse the damage to our beloved parks reputation. Â So one person at a time we are changing people's perception of what Seaworld truly is and how important of a role they play in keeping our sea life going, maintained, and protected in addition to educating our younger generations.As I pull in today and see the long line of protestors attempting to ""Save Shamu""I can only hope to think their intentions are noble and true to their own hearts and not some disgusting attempt to harm an establishment whom has given so much to millions. I'm sure many years ago they too have made their mistakes, but as we continue to advance our education and awareness towards securing natures most beautiful gifts...Learn from our mistakes and understand that It's the acts of kindness and offering of protection for tomorrow that will allow us to advance for future generations to come and separate us all from the rest!!!"
718,4/21/2016,5,"As a MAJOR animal lover, a member of PETA and Mercy for Animals, I have to say, I LOVE Sea World!!!! It was the most magical experience I've ever had at an amusement park! To see beautiful creatures of the sea up close and personal was a dream come true! The staff at Sea World is very friendly and helpful and the trainers clearly love the animals they work with, as well as the work they do! Sea World is the world's largest contributor to marine life rehabilitation and restoration. They rescue sea lions, dolphins, cats, dogs and even birds. Their goal is to rehabilitate them and re-release them into the wild. I have seen Blackfish and I absolutely see the importance of allowing wild animals to remain free. However, I understand that orcas in captivity will die if they're released into the wild, so my wish would be for them to be treated as well as possible and for Sea World to abstain from catching any more wild animals and stand by their promise to no longer breed orcas in captivity."
719,7/31/2017,4,I have been to Sea World once when I was little. I have a great memory as a kid learning about the sea animals. After 17 years I finally returned to sea world and its a great place to spend time with family and little ones. The shows vary by days so its much better to check ahead of times to make sure you can watch each ones. The highlight shows are in order from popularity to least:1. Curcque electrique (night)2. Dolphin days (day)3. pets rule (day)4. Illuminght (night)5. sea lion6. OrcaFor the food its expensive but they have an all day meal planthat you can pay about $40 for adult and $20 for kids to dine all day in selected stores.The pineapple pete island eat has great funnel cake with ice cream topped and all.
720,10/4/2016,5,"Free tickets for Active, Reserve....and Veterans every year until September. Register at ""Waves of Honors"" and sign up. Thank you for taking good care of us. We dressed up for Spooktacular and went trick or treating. So kids had so much friend. The kids play area is amazing, way better than the zoo."
721,1/9/2017,4,"Came for Shamu's final show, getting into the parking was a little more chaotic than I would like. We paid for the close parking $22. Purchased our tickets online the night before for a $20 dollar discount, and were able to walk right into the park. Â I found it easy to get around the whole.The dolphin stadium, seal and otter stadium, and the shamu stadiums provided a great view from any seat. Kids got close sat in soak zone and cooled off during the Shamu show. Great music and enthusiastic performers made the shows entertaining for the entire family. Kids enjoyed feeding the manter rays and petting the sharks. We ate at the Mama Stella's restaurant and found the food ok and as expected pricey."
722,5/21/2015,5,"It was a wonderful experience. I was just there 5/20/15, a Wednesday. We came right when they open and avoided any crowds. We got general parking ($16) and did not park very far. They offer close up parking ($21) but we didn't mind walking and I'm am so glad I didn't.When you walk in they have petting pools filled with different animals and people explaining the different fishes there. I didn't think I would like it but it was so much fun touching the fishes! They have a shamu show at 11:30am so we went to the seals to feed them, then to the stingrays. The sting rays were the best! You can pet them, they removed the stingers, and you can also buy food to feed them. The seals/sea lion were fed fishes and squid for the rays. My friend LOVE the rays that we went back a few times. The feed does cost $5 dollars and we're completely worth it. The birds there are fierce and will grab fish from your hand so be careful if you have small children because it was scary to me who's 26. Maybe your child will be more fearless than me with those birds. Who knows? The shamu show was great, a must see, bring a rain jacket or some extra clothes. It is worth it to sit in the soak zone. We also saw the dolphins show and saw all of the other exhibits. We rode the ride that took you over the water across to the other side of the island. I forgot what it was called but it is breathe taking because you get to see the islands and all the views. Short version and tips : go on a weekday, it was not busy at all, practically empty. They have plenty of bathrooms for children and adults. Go pet the sting rays and save the 5 dollars from 'close parking' to feed the sting rays or seals. Go ride the ride over mission bay, it's free and very worth it. There is a lot of walking so wear comfortable clothing. Bring a backpack to keep your things in because it makes it easier than carrying a purse with all the animal petting you'll be doing! :)"
723,11/10/2016,5,"So I haven't been to SeaWorld in about 15-20 years, mostly for political reasons(Orca handling). It was a real conflict for me, because I grew up going to SeaWorld almost everyday in the summers. Usually I had a Shame pass and I would sneak my friends in the entry gate by rubbing my hand stamp onto their hand. Then they would do it to the next kid, until we were all in and having a blast in Captain Kidd's world. We were kids, sorry. So basically, I grew up loving everything about SeaWorld.Then I got older and wanted better conditions for the Orca's. Don't get me wrong. I never thought SeaWorld was this evil entity, just concerned with money. This was my big conflict. I loved SeaWorld for being a champion for marine animals and striving to educate the public, at the same time as entertaining us with these magical shows. Every trainer, I ever spoke with, absolutely loved their job and had the animals welfare in mind. But in the back of my mind, I knew that the Orca's needed a bigger enclosure and tighter world wide regulations on taking them from the wild. So I run a limo company and did some limo trade for tickets about 11 years ago. I've had them sitting on my desk all that time and today I took 3 friends in town from Chicago. The lucky bastards are on a magical high. The Cubs just won the World Series, Trump won the Presidential race, San Diego legalized marijuana, and they get to go to SeaWorld while on vacation on a 85 degree sunny day in San Diego. Enough of those lucky bastards.So my tickets I battered for seem to be expired. I didn't notice the small printed expiration date of 2007. Oops! Even though CA law says gift cards/certificates don't expire, SeaWorld didn't even try and ruin my day. Ashley at the ticket desk was such a sweetheart! She asked me to wait while she talked to a manager. Her manager never saw old tickets like this and had to call someone else. Finally, a sweet manager that has been there for 25 years recognizes the old tickets and gives the thumbs up to honor them. The word ""honor"" is very important to me on this most honorable day. It's 11/10, the(my( Marine Corps birthday. Not only did Ashley welcome us from the start with smiles, but she totally made my Marine Corps birthday an awesome day! She also hooked us up with some front of the line passes, and got us preferred seats at the Shamu show. Which by the way was outstanding and all the Orca's looked healthy and happy, and the trainers were having a ball. What a great job to have!I feel kinds dorky to say what my favorite part of the day was. But it was sticking my arms in the water and having surgeon fish feed on my dead skin particles. Such a cool idea. I restrained from putting my feet in the water.Once again, Ashley, you are an awesome ambassador for SeaWorld."
724,4/29/2015,5,"On my day off work I wanted to do something fun. It was 80 something today & since I'm less than 30 minutes from SeaWorld, why not? Hubby works at the water park so I get in Yay!! Â Came here when it opened. Employees seemed friendly and quite a few walking around for a week day. Glad I came on a weekday when it wasn't too busy. First we headed to the Shamu show 1130. Got there early and sat in the splash zone. It was interesting learning about killer whales and employees who have worked at SeaWorld for over 10 years. I was hoping we get wet, since we were sitting in the splash zone. But we didn't...we were in the 16th row lol! It was funny seeing kids in the front get soaked though lmao!Then after the show we headed to Cafe 64 for burgers & brew. We got burger with blue cheese, lettuce and bread, Cesar salad & souvenir cup (refills day of btdub). The burger was alright, nothing to rave about. Definitely didn't like waiting 10 minutes for it. They weren't too organized in the Cafe 64, as far as foot traffic goes. I would have prepared ahead of time since it was around noon. But that's my opinion. After lunch we headed to sea lions then the dolphins show with pilot whales. That was pretty amazing. Seeing the dolphins spin around. I even had "" Here comes the sun"" song in my head the rest of the day lol Â My favorite was the penguin habitat. It was so nice and cool, keep out from the heat! You enter and there's a conveyor belt that moves you past the penguins swimming & chill in out. Which takes you directly to the store. I bought a couple things for niece and nephew. But want to go back and get a wine glass for myself. There were also Â penguins outside where babies were incubating.The best way to end the day with pineapple whip! Yum!!!!! So glad they have it so worth"
725,3/22/2015,4,"First trip to SeaWorld was great even after watching Blackfish. Â Best part was getting in for free! It was much better than what I expected.Here are some tips for first timers:-Get there early before they open the park so you can have time for everything. Â -Grab a map to check out the times for the shows and plan around that. Â -Wear walking shoes obviously. Â -You can take food and Â in the park just not tin foil so you won't have to spend tons of money on food. Â -Use restroom when you see them cause if you wait it might be too late. Â I had to walk around for five minutes looking and then wait five minutes another time. Â -If you buy a souvenir cup for 16 bucks, Â you get free refills all day then one dollar each time you visit. -There's a sesame street play area for the kids. Â Don't go there until you've watched the shows... that was our first stop and I spent way tooooo much time there... Â Have fun!"
726,5/8/2015,4,"I'm a sucker for Sea World and the San Diego Zoo. Â I've been coming to amusement parks in southern California all my life and now that I'm older with a kid of my own, it makes me happy beyond measure to take him to all the spots I enjoyed growing up. Â And it's been almost 20 years since I've been here, so I can't really compare the old Sea World with the new. Â But, it doesn't change the fact that what's here now is gorgeous and a lot of fun.Many will complain about the prices (which, in all honesty, are Disney-esque), and with the simplest of lunches breaking that $10 barrier, that assertion is difficult to dispute. Â Still, when you get passed the $16 parking, get tickets that suit your family, and eat the breakfast you either brought from home or got off the dollar menu somewhere else on the drive down, you can then enjoy a nice day at the park. Â Right through the gates are petting ponds with sharks and sting rays to immediately excite kids with a cool and tactile experience. Â From there you can feed seals hungry to showcase their clapping and barking skills for fish. Â And then it's on to whales, otters, dolphins, and more. Â There's even a small water play area in the park center with a Sesame Street theme for children that want something a bit more exciting than watching animal exhibits and aren't big enough for the actual roller coasters.Which leads to the problems with the park.There are those roller coasters, which is both not really fitting with the aquarium theme and sad to note because apparently the shows themselves aren't enough to bring in crowds who find dancing killer whales and frolicking penguins boring. Â When i was a kid, I remember spending days here and loving to see as much as I could, not needing Atlantis the Ride to keep me busy; and I was a brat who's brain was 'addled' into short attention span-ness by fast food and Atari 2600.Of course, on the flip side of this, if you have a toddler who finds it tough to sit through the longer shows, there isn't a ton of other stuff for everyone to do together. Â The kids' area can give some entertainment, but you may find yourself leaving after a scant five hours or so, having seen all else there is to see. Â Still, there is a lot to visually delight and everything is so beautiful, it all flows so well, that it's worth checking out at least once for yourself.As for my family, we'll take our passes and drive down for an afternoon a few times a month to enjoy it all."
727,3/28/2017,5,"We bought the GoCity card which included SeaWorld if you got a 3 day pass. --$35.99 all you can eat is more than worth the price. If anything, we ate a little too much as a result. The food tasted fresh and there were healthy options instead of only desserts there were fruits too. The lines were pretty short which was a blessing because we expected wait time for being a Sunday. The only negative is you do not need to be able to eat every hour. Make it $30 a person and allow people to eat every two hours instead. You probably have people eat hourly because they can which is a waste of food. --$50 each person for behind the scene tour with penguins was well worth the price! We paid almost $200 per person to swim with dolphins once which was fun, but the penguin encounter was a much better deal for the price. We really appreciated how we were able to see a penguin up close, get pics, pet the penguin, go to the back to see all penguins, and one of the animal keepers came out and talked to us. He was very knowledgeable and so interesting!--The shows were good, but I thought in the past (and it's been years since we visited) that if you were late to a show you could not enter. Now they let people enter late and it's really distracting. People should not be allowed late into shows! --For being a small place, we sure had our day packed with fun. We were bummed that they closed so early. Can't wait to go back in a few years."
728,6/6/2015,5,"Had so much fun here today! They are doing a micro beer fest as well as foods from around the world. I loved it! Â I got to try some really creative food from different cultures and some great beers. What a great idea! I actually got inspired to go he and try expanding my home cooking menu. Â The food choices that I made were scallops, French waffles, lamb slider, hummus flatbread and a few others. When this event is occurring I highly recommend visiting!!I have always loved sea world park. The manta ride is a blast and short lines allow you to ride several times. As always the Penguins and turtles are my highlight. I love the turtle tank! So awesome to watch those big guys swim around. Everything was very clean, it wasn't very crowded, and the staff are very friendly!"
729,5/5/2019,2,"I went about 12 years ago with my family and it was such a beautiful and fun experience. I went yesterday and I was very disappointed. All the animals look so sad. The exhibitions and animal enclosures are small in my opinion. It took my husband and I maybe 5 mins to get through each one. We saw the entire park in one day. We saw the orca encounter show as well and I liked that it has a lot of information for the audience regarding orca information. But it was a little boring. No tricks from the whales like they used to do 12 years ago. It's just informative. I was very sad with the outcome. The food is also way too expensive. We spent $51 for two people and it wasn't anything special. Two small pizzas, a small basket of fries, strawberries, and a small chicken Alfredo. No drinks. Too pricey for my opinion. The pizzas reminded me of elementary school food. In the end, I'm not sure if I would come back. It was so sad how much it has changed. There's not a whole lot of animals."
730,3/4/2016,5,For the first time and with a kid this is a 5 star experience. this was my son (20 month old) first experience and he thoroughly enjoyed it. He was captivated by the big whale and jumping dolphin and the small fishes in pond. Surprisingly he found the seal and pet show as his favourite really enjoying their jumping. The caretakers and staff put on a good show and it was a lot of fun. But the price is expensive considering we have a free zoo next to our house (chicago -lincoln park zoo)
731,10/28/2018,5,Great park. Larger than expected. I had a great time and parking was easy. Purchased ticket online which saved me money so I was able to upgrade to allow me to get the food pass so you can eat throughout the day.
732,2/17/2016,4,"Good park to have a nice day with the family, overall with kids. The sites to see the killer whales and the dolphins (for me the major attractions) are very good.I was a little disappointed that the Dolphin Stadium was in maintenance but the conditioned site to see the dear mammals was good enough to see them close and in action.The big windows to see the killer whales under their pool is super good, you can see them swimming around. The show is a lot of fun, and yes... don't be scare of getting wet, just bring a couple of extra t-shirts and flip flops.Something that I really liked was that you can sense the commitment and passion Â from the trainers about the animals and their environment.The ""Wild Artic Ride"" attraction is totally outdated, they should at least make it 3D. It was like getting into a vintage ride.The Manta... not even close to the one in Orlando. They shouldn't even call them Manta... it should be "" Manta Jr. ""The petting zone is nice for the kids to get excited touching the rays and fishes."
733,3/20/2017,4,"Its good going here on a weekday, not packed at all.Pricing's a bit expensive 93.00/eachParkings goodThe food's actually pretty good.The aquariums are greatMy son enjoyed it"
734,3/27/2018,5,"I go to Sea World every year and the experience is always a good one. I know SeaWorld has taken some heat the past few years about mistreating their animals but I find that to be not true. Everyone loves and wants what is best for the animals in the park. They are their giant pets. Yes, the orcas are not meant to live in containment, but I feel Sea World is doing everything they can to make sure their animals are comfortable by increasing the size of their tanks and much more."
735,2/3/2013,5,"Penguins! Â Penguins! Â Penguins! Â :) Â I went at the end of Jan and a note to myself...this is the time to go! Â This is best time for them to be active, flipping, swimming and being the cutest they could possibly be. Â (Bring a sweatshirt if you end up hanging out in the observation deck. Â The air is blasting up there.)Food-wise: the generic concession stands are all the same. Â I like Calypso Bay for the bbq and Pineapple Pete's for the $8 funnel cake with fruit topping of your choice and soft serve. Â Just a warning, do NOT get the strawberry topping. Â I'm not exactly sure how they got it to taste like artificial candy strawberries, but nothing was good about it. Â We ended up eating around everything it didn't touch...which is still more than enough for 2 adults and 1 toddler. Â :Dp.s. On the weekdays...I'm not sure if it is always dead but I went on a Thursday and took off work because I thought it was going to be swamped. Â There was about 100 ppl I saw the entire time I was there. Â A major bummer because there is also less shows and most start at noon. Â p.p.s. On the site I saw 9:30 opening. Â They'll let Â you in but nothing officially opens until 10 AM. Â You can only use the bathroom by the front entrance too."
736,4/10/2017,5,"Yay! Sea World. Been coming here since I was a kid! I could never forget their Shamu and Dolphin shows. The food places not so great, with the exception of their BBQ restaurant. The walk around the park is totally tolerable and the show calendar and times always helpful."
737,12/9/2017,1,Spend $91 at shipwreck In sea world for a family of 4! ... yeah that just happen! Run run far far away!
738,2/19/2017,5,"Love Sea World...although there aren't as many rides as Disneyland , Legoland, Magic Mountain, etc...that's not ultimately why they're here. My family loves this park because it's like visiting an aquarium with many extra perks : shows, rides, eateries, and giant kids playground. Sea World works hard to increase everyone's wildlife /sea life awareness. Another great perk is that this place is not as crowded as many other parks. You can still walk around without feeling like you are being herded from place to place, suffocating in that herd. Food isn't too bad, and if you are staying the whole day, there is an option to pay once and eat the whole day. There's something for everyone here :)"
739,7/14/2018,1,"This 1 star is not a representation of Sea World or my families time spent there. However it is a direct representation of the customer service that I received at Ship Wreck Cafe by Thialia. Absolutely disgusted by her poor service. We had asked for two cheeseburgers and one veggie burger. She quickly brought the two cheeseburgers to us and then disappeared. During this time the rest of my family was paying for their food. She finally came back, put the veggie burger in the ""oven"" and then told me it would be five minutes. Once she told me that, I just asked to have the pizza that had been sitting there because like I had said before the rest of my party had already left and paid for their food. She then rudely asks "" so you don't want the veggie?"" and rolls her eyes. I responded "" no, it's fine. I will just have the pizza"". Then she grabs the pizza aggressively and basically throws the fries into the plate. Another guy comes up behind her and can obviously see my frustration and states that there was in fact a veggie patty ready in the warmer. They check it, and apparently it wasn't ""ready"" and she comes back to let me know again that it will be five minutes. I still just opted for the pizza so we could eat together. Her rudeness was very noticeable as the gentleman behind me even made a comment about me making sure I got her name. We looked for a manager but no one could direct us to one. I am very disappointed that my great day spent with family was met with such poor customer service. We spent a great deal of money and expected more. We hope that this will be addressed because who knows how many people she has acted like this to. I am not one to associate a place with a single employee but with others, you might not be so lucky. I really hope her performance is dealt with."
740,6/24/2015,4,"Cute shows and even the preshow was entertaining. Worth slowing down from running around the park to watch some shows. The seals are my favorite as far as shows go, they're hilarious."
741,5/4/2017,5,"Looking back, why would I rate SeaWorld 5 stars? Their aquariums are cool. They have a nice ride selection, and the Shamu Cookies are the #1 thing they have going for them. I have become more aware recently of the realities of keeping large cetaceans in captivity and making them perform, and I cannot agree with it. The decision to stop this practice was long needed. I would love to see more focus on wildlife conservation and education, and less on using whales for entertainment.Or perhaps they will go the way of Barnum & Baileys; they are nothing without their elephants."
742,6/14/2015,4,"We went for my sisters birthday. We got a deal where you buy a day and come back a second day. My sister end up getting a pass for the rest of the year for around $80. Â I haven't been here since I was a kid. 20 years later it's pretty nice to share it with friends. We went through the rides like Journey to Atlantis and Antarctica. They need to update at least the intro video of Antartica... I believe it's still the same. We went to the Pets Rule show... Same thing as I remembered it except for the animals. It was still entertaining and fun to watch though. I just wouldn't go multiple times as it seems that it would get boring. Manta was also down for a few hours. We really enjoyed the Cirque De La Mer show.there were quite a few acrobats doing flips into the water, hanging really high up, dancing, and laughter. The exhibits were also fun to go through for pictures and education. The whole place got jammed pack. We kept missing shows after 3 because there was just that many people. We end up feeding the seals sardines which was like $6 for a tray of fish. We also went to the cleaning fish and got our hands cleaned. We probably stayed there the longest. We left around Â 430; good thing we can always come back. I end up giving a 4, because service was great and we love the deals that they have. Photographers took our pictures like we were celebs. A $30 wristband can get you meals all day without paying more than that. My sister and I plan to just buy one next time and just share! We ate and the smokehouse. The chicken was dry but other than that it was delicious. Any seaworld drinkware also was free refill day of and $1 refill when you go return. Overall it was a fun day."
743,8/4/2018,1,"I really wish that I could rate this business higher, but the poor customer service skills the employees have is a huge problem. I was really looking forward to spending some time with my family and things were going well until we got to one of the rides, The Electric Eel. One of the employees was very rude (a heavyset woman) and urged me to take off the long-sleeved shirt that was tightly wrapped around my waist and to wear it for the ride, even though I was already buckled in, so I figured to take it off and tossed it near the edge of wall, but of course the female employee was very angry and urged me to get someone to unbuckle me to retrieve my long sleeve shirt and wear it all the while the rest of the employees were collecting other people's belongings. I don't understand why it was such a big deal for them to collect the shirt (it wasn't big) and they clearly had the room in their bin to hold on to it for the short ride if they didn't allow it to remain along the side of the wall, or at least ask me nicely to wear it instead. It's unfortunate that most of the negative attitudes of the employees are directed at their customers, which is just bad customer service skills that is generally bad for business. SeaWorld better aim to improve its hiring process or they are going to lose a lot of business if they continue to treat its customers like crap."
744,5/25/2015,4,"Love the buy a day and get a year special. Still great to bring your kids too. It's not as fun as I remember when I was a kid, but that may be because I have 4 of my own now. :::laughs::: Parking is ridiculously expensive, as is all else in the park. The fun card is worth it if you have kids and live locally."
745,4/24/2018,5,"I took a trip to sea world with a couple of my friends, but my favorite part of the experience was visiting the shipwreck reef cafe. Chris, took good care of us. Offering us many options. I also love riding the manta ray ride. Definitely looking forward to the new electric eel ride coming soon!!!"
746,9/10/2015,5,"Had an amazing time learning about all the animals. Â All the staff was extremely knowledgeable. Â I love all the work sea world does for animals and sea preservation My husband and I did the beluga whale experience it was one of the best things I have ever done. Â  The trainer was amazing. Â We got to feed them, get kisses, pet and play with them for about 20 minutes. Just a note: they do not allow cameras in to the experience so for all the photographers out there you might be disappointed. The photographer they sent with us was disappointing"
747,9/9/2018,5,"Fabulous day at Sea World with three generations of our family. Â Great rides, attractions and beautiful animal exhibits for beluga whales, penguins, dolphins and more. Â We LOVED lunch with the Orcas. Â Delicious all you can eat buffet (roast beef, chicken, shrimp, meatballs, salads, beautiful desserts) while having educational program featuring 4 whales and 4 trainers. Â Waiter was so kind and helpful with the kids. Â  ALL of us had a wonderful day---from 3 year old to grandparent."
748,11/17/2018,1,"I'm so angry right now. We normally get annual passes from Disneyland, but we've lived in San Diego for 15 years so we decided to just do something closer to home. One extra they offer is two free one-day passes to bring a friend. They don't give you the finer details which is that you don't get the passes at the same time and they'll email you when they decide you can use one. How did we find out? Well, we called to find out how to pick up the passes so my teen son could bring two friends. The man we spoke to knew nothing so we requested his supervisor. I am not exaggerating here; we were on hold for over an hour and then disconnected. Next call.....sorry, but you have to speak to someone in annual passes. Transfer. This person pulls up our pass info, tells us to go to Zone A and we can get our passes there, but only today and tomorrow before days are blocked. No problem. We planned to go tomorrow. However.....we decided to pick up the passes today. Guess what? No passes. A manager said he accessed the recording from the call and that the worker told us the directions IF we were able to get the passes, but we weren't able to because, again, we wait for some obscure date for an email to be sent and then we get one of the two passes promised. We wait for another obscure date for the 2nd pass. So the manager flat-out lied to my face, because the worker on the phone never said IF we were able to get passes. She simply said it was no problem and told us how to pick them up. He lied about what he heard because he knew his own representative said we could get the passes and he didn't want to honor that agreement. So...we spoke with his supervisor. She was so, so, so sorry, but we would have to wait for that imaginary date for the email. However we could buy two tickets and she would give us a discount. Seriously? So I have 4 teenage boys hitting up Dave & Buster's tomorrow, 7 months left paying on SW annual passes, and I already hesitated on Seaworld based on their reputation, but we definitely won't be back. I'd rather pay more and sit in traffic for Disneyland than spend a dime at a place where managers look right at you and lie. Side note: If you still plan to go, but aren't familiar with the park layout, get a map. The workers are useless if you ask them. I seriously have not seen blanker looks on faces other than the stoner area of the lawn at my high school."
749,7/26/2018,1,Highly disappointed with Sea World... Such a down grade from years ago... I brought my kids (7 and 4 years old) here for the first time today and they thought it was boring too! The shows lack enthusiasm and performance. The Orca show is now a documentary / educational show. I get that the trainers can no longer go on the water to perform with the Orcas but man... I was not expecting this... Food quality is horrible and everything is over priced. The one thing we enjoyed was the Shipwreck rapid ride. I don't think I'll be going back here unless they make some drastic upgrades....
750,6/4/2017,5,"Haven't been to the park in a few years. They have upgraded and changed the park. It's more educational based. People are unaware how Sea World helps injured and abandoned animals that would never survive in the wild. My daughter fed a blind sea lion, & learned so much about animals. It's a fun atmosphere. Â Staff was very interactive and readily available to answer any questions. Â I love the new changes- We had a blast!"
751,2/16/2018,1,"I am a frequent Seaworld visitor and my family loves Seaworld, but today was ridiculous. I called just to get an explanation about why the Veterans Promotion was discontinued or when it may be available again. The customer service representative was not knowledgeable in this area, so I gave him time to explore for an answer. He came back with wrong information. I began to simplify the reason for my call and a response that would be satisfactory. I am a Veteran and Federal Employee so I am patient and understanding to people possibly being in training. Long story Short when i asked for a supervisor or someone to explain this to me he hung up in my face. The phone was on speaker and 3 other veterans and civil servants witnessed this who also frequent SeaWorld."
752,8/4/2013,5,"I love how SeaWorld supports teachers with complimentary annual passes! Â As long as they keep it up, I'll be getting annual passes for my family members so they can come with me. Â They have a buy a day, get the rest of the year free deal for 2014, and the tickets are in the 70s at Ralph's Market, last I checked.Long Beach Aquarium is closer, but SeaWorld is larger, and has more stuff to do. Â I don't mind spending some money and supporting their cause. Â What they do for endangered animals is awesome.I love the penguin exhibit. Â The speakers are enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Go during the winter, when they turn the lights on, so it's easier to see and take photos.Feeding time is great, for any of the animal exhibits. Â I love watching the otters eat prawns, and clean their faces, and the puffins swim excitedly for their food. Â It's cute watching children learn to feed dolphins, and get water splashed all over them.The rides are decent, considering it isn't a roller coaster park. Â I like the innovation. Â Also, they have some pretty good shows. Â They have a Cirque du Soleil like show, and some comedy acts, and animal stunt acts."
753,1/2/2015,2,"As a San Diego native, I've been going to Sea World since I was about 5 yrs old. Â I've always enjoyed the interaction with the animals (through glass and walls) and the learning opportunities everywhere.Now as an adult, I feel like I'm a little bit more tuned into the whole picture. (I'm not going to go into the whole Blackfish aspect) Â but just as a customer experience. Â Overall, I do think that the park is making headway into creating more educational opportunities rather then making it all about entertainment and having animals doing performances-- that period seems to be heavily waning. Â I love the new interaction pools near the entrance where you can put your hands in and touch the different kinds of fish. Â The ray pool is also fun like this.But there are many parts of Sea World that are showing their age-- lack of updating and creating meaningful experiences. One area that is extremely lacking is the Wild Arctic. Â After waiting in line for 20+ minutes, we went in to see the Beluga whales and the Polar Bears. Â Only problem is that the polar bears were on loan to a breeding program. Â I visited two times in about 3 months and they were still not there-- just an empty pool of water. Â So Sea World needs to figure out how to provide other viewing and educational opportunities if animals are not part of the regular program. (Imagine telling you kids that the polar bears are gone. Again. After the long wait)Other exhibits like the penguin encounter and the shark exhibit are interesting but once you've seen it, you've seen it all. Â Can they install other things to help illustrate and education kids about these animals?Other things that need to be fixed-- the Sky tower. Â I made the mistake of riding the sky tower soon after a friend's FB post told us it got stuck. Â Thankfully we were only stuck for about 15 minutes, but it seems indicative that this ride needs some major work.Lastly, I'm not very confident about the level of security at this park. Â Recently, I took my three girls and was just pulling into a parking space and a young man is standing in the spot and refuses to leave. (He was saving it for his middle aged Ukranian mother driving her mercedes sports sedan.....) Â I told her that it's not polite or appropriate for people to be standing in a parking spot and she just went off on me... I tried to find a security guard and was looking for a phone number on the website but couldn't find one. Â Thankfully there was no physical altercation, but what if I really needed help? Â Sea World needs to have more visible security guards and have a telephone number posted that people can dial to get through immediately. End of story."
754,2/17/2018,4,First time visit in many years and very impressed with the professionalism and cleanliness and things to do. Holiday weekend and the crowds got back by noon - next time would go not on a holiday weekend. I was surprised the shows filled up before start time. They seem to have a lot of emphasis on conservation. I liked that on the Arctic side there were lots of places to escape from the heat and also the child swap on big rides was great. I'm excited for the traditional Christmas celebration next December that I missed this year! In four hours we didn't quite see half the park so I'm glad we have the annual pass and don't have to cram.
755,5/18/2017,4,I am writing to update my review from last month. Â I am glad to report that after numerous calls and emails I was able to obtain my preschool passes. Â My feedback to Sea World is thank you for doing the right thing. Â It took too long and was time spent on this versus other items. It would be great if you could empower your team members to make the right decision from the get go. Â The associate I spoke to stated this should have been approved the first go around.Thank you for making this right.
756,5/30/2017,4,"We just took a trip to San Diego tbis past weekend, and spent the day at Sea World. This was my first trip to.Sea World, and although I had a really good time, I guess i expected more. The dolphin show was my favorite. The whale show has been drastically changed from what I had saw online in the past. I didnt find it fun or interesting in any way."
757,8/31/2017,1,"Thanks for bringing up your website! I couldn't include it in my previous review because I ran out of space. FYI, I did check SeaWorld's website for available rides many times since March 2017, the rides that are closed for the day are not updated on the website. The information provided on the website does not match the ride closure signage at the park.According to your response: ""I suggest downloading our SeaWorld Discovery Guide app for the most updated ride status information available."" Does that mean the website and the signage DO NOT have the most updated ride status information? How do I trust the app to be accurate? And how do I trust that the app will accurately inform the customers on ""Temporary Closed Rides""? I don't want to waste my time, money, and gas again just to find out the rides that I want to go on are either ""Closed for the day"" or ""Temporary Closed"". Again, SeaWorld should INFORM THE CUSTOMERS FULLY, so the customers have a CHOICE to make an INFORMED DECISION!Stop defending yourself. Just fix your problems and issues."
758,5/5/2015,4,"The new app is great, makes it really easy to find your way around sea world plus it has the updated show times on it rather than the outdated one on the back of the paper map. Â There are also some pretty cool features to it.Do stop and let the sucker fish nibble on your hands it'll leave them baby soft. Â Sit in the splash zone and get wet. Â Have a water fight with a dolphin and enter the artic dripping wet."
759,9/6/2016,1,"Google Dolphin hunt, LA TimesI came back to sea world, because I was forced to by my company. I threatened to boycott, but I was told, show up or don't come to work on Monday. The whales were so sad. They were over worked and scared. Most of their dorsal fins were flopped to one side. This is a terrible place. I will never return again. Ever."
760,6/7/2017,5,"Sea World is a great park. We're a family of 6 and did Disneyland earlier this year and just went to Sea World. Sea World is so much easier and therefore more enjoyable than Disney. The parking is fast and easy, lines for rides are very short (we waited no more than 10 minutes for any of them), Sesame Street play area and rides were great to recharge the little ones, and the sea animal shows are fantastic. It's an amazing learning experience for kids to see these sea animals up close and to learn so much about them. Our kids got to feed stingrays for $5 and loved all the touch tanks. Overall a great day with small crowds and educational fun!!"
761,1/8/2017,4,Shamu's last show makes you realize how times are changing. The new plans for the park are exciting but the park is definitely turning into question straight amusement park. Tons more rides over the next couple of years.
762,4/3/2018,5,JP At the front was extremely helpful with Getting our family into the park with no hassle we had a small situation that he dealt with amazingly. JP ended up making our trip to sea world much more pleasant.
763,12/28/2014,3,"Yes, I watched Blackfish. Yes, I cried. But it doesn't take away from the fact that this place creates fascination in children who later become veterinarians and marine biologists or zoologists as a result of their visit to Sea World. I was reluctant to come here but I believed my daughter needed to experience this (and we got in for free) so we ventured out here for a day. It was smaller than I remembered and a lot more packed than I would have liked. Did you guys not watch Blackfish, helloooo? Just kidding. Sea World has always been fascinating for me as I have always loved the sea. My love for the ocean was created by The Little Mermaid and I have had a place in my heart for the sea creatures ever since. I would have liked the viewing areas to be a little better placed as most often than not, I was standing on my tippy toes to see anything, and being that I'm 5'7"" I feel bad for any child. But I enjoyed the visit. Would I come here again? Probably not. For free? Absolutely."
764,11/28/2016,5,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!Park is clean and well maintained. Great kids area and rides. Dolphin, Killer whale, and pets shows are outstanding. Artic station is my favorite place because of Belugas. Only positive experience. The food was great and fresh, not overpriced. Definitely will be back asap.:)"
765,3/7/2018,4,"I still feel sad seeing the animals, especially the dolphins and orcas, in such a small habitat but for what it is... it is a fun place to bring the younger kids and older kids will enjoy the rides. The interactive habitats up front where you can ""pet"" fish is cool but really no guarantee that people make sure their hands are clean before putting it in the water... those poor animals. They should have some order where visitors clearly wash their hands BEFORE petting any animal."
766,6/20/2017,5,"SeaWorld San Diego was a great place to spend the day with my family, and kept us entertained the whole way! I started off the day by ""Feeling the rush on the Manta"" and I got to say that is one of the best coasters I've ever been on. It didn't have Â and steep drops or loops and would be a good thrill for the little ones. I then explored ""Penguin encounter"" and did a Helicopter ride to the south pole base station, pet some dolphins, and saw the 3 funny shows on dogs, sea lions, and dolphins. I also visited the arcade and the manager gave us 100 free tokens because of a machine malfunction. Overall the trip was well worth it and the customer service was impeccable."
767,7/21/2018,2,"This place has really gone down hill since last time I visited. The Aquarium has barely any fish and World of Fishes is covered in algae and really disappointing. I was hesitant to go back after watching Blackfish, but I had heard they made improvements. They still use the Orcas in shows though, even though they do less tricks than before it's still kind of sad to see them and it's a let down because the whales still seem to be treated poorly and are housed in a small tank. I was really excited because I wanted to see the Orcas and figured they'd be in a larger tank and forced to preform less, but I was let down. I know they can't release them because they won't be able to fend for themselves in the wild but I feel like the least they could do is expand their tank, it looks so small compared to the size of the whales. The other animals all look comfortable in their tanks though and the tanks seem to be a decent size. The other shows are more entertaining to watch, the Sea Lion one is the best. The food pass is worth it if you want to eat more than once, because the food is really over priced, but the food isn't that good. We tried lots of different restaurants while we were there and they all weren't the best quality and the wait time for food is very long. Some of the ""high quality"" food items cost more and snacks (popcorn, ice cream, cotton candy) aren't included which kind of sucks because they used to be included in the old food deal. Overall I was just really disappointed in my visit because the park seemed trashier than before. It was dirty and some parts seemed completely unkept. The employees all seemed to hate their jobs and the customer service was awful. The lines for the rides were ridiculously long so I only went on Journey to Atlantis. Some parts of the park seem to be stuck in the past as not much has been updated since my last visit a decade ago. I know seaworld helps with conservation and rescue efforts but I think they should put money back into their park and renovate it and focus on the animals and their conditions instead of building new roller coasters that you have to wait hours to ride. I won't be returning to the park any time soon."
768,5/16/2016,4,"We enjoyed our trip. It was our daughters 1st time. Not very crowded, was able to watch the dolphin show (our favorite show) and pet show.Lot of exhibits to see and lots of areas where you can touch the sea animals."
769,3/29/2018,3,"3 Starts because it was free...teacher fun card! Usually I love Sea World but yesterday I was bummed out. The water quality seemed dirty, the employees were not helpful and the food was horrible! Tried to see The Orcas but the water in the tank was super cloudy. The other tanks were clear and the fish looked healthy and happy. The employees were not helpful, no one knew where the bathrooms were and when you travel with 4 women you always need to know where a bathroom is! Also my 4 year old lace cream broke in half and the lady said they would not replace it, so I had to walk with my crying 4 year old daughter to get a manager so we could get another $6 Ice cream. It's for a kid, we're not secretly trying to get free ice cream! The Food was awful! $60 plus dollars for two cold, cardboard, flavorless pizzas, a kids meal and two bud lights. The Food was really bad, I mean 5 day old Little Caesars pizza has more flavor and is a 1/3 of the price. Overall Sea World was okay, not totally awful but not good by any means."
770,8/14/2016,4,"My husband and I took our 11 month old son to Sea World so that he could have a memorable experience. We got in for free because he is a veteran and stayed a few hours. We did not check out any of the shows but went to many of the exhibits. My son absolutely loved the dolphin, sea lion and sea otter exhibits. The joy in his face was just delightful. He was chasing after the seagulls (careful they bite) and really enjoyed himself. We ate a turkey leg which was so delicious and drank a couple of alcoholic beverages. The prices are reasonable for Sea World."
771,4/24/2018,5,"Haven't been here in over 10 years so I decided to take my son & I must say if you will be there all day do the all day dining it is really worth it,Especially if you have little ones,I will definitely try to go back in about a year or two"
772,2/8/2018,5,"I've been coming to Sea World since I was a kid. It's definitely changed over the years, and I hadn't been able to come for quite a few years. I am able now to bring my children and we all enjoy it together! I love the remodeling that they've done in the front, though of course, I'll miss some of the nostalgia from the past. I miss the Cirque dolphin show, but I really like the educational shows they have going on now. I didn't get to see the new Orca encounter event, as I keep forgetting.I will say though, the Piranha feeding at 11:30 is pretty cool. Get there by 11:15 because as soon as it starts, it's a frenzy and ends ridiculously quick. My daughter loves being able to see the animals in the water, and with our pass, we will be definitely coming back fairly often!"
773,3/6/2016,4,I love it here. We had so much fun and my kids loved seeing all the animals. We got the meal plan and felt it was well worth the money. There was one thing that happened on our very recent trip there. I'm sharing this as a warning to other parents wherever they make take their kids. While visiting one of the aquariums( I think it was the turtle rescue) my kids ran up to the tank to get a good look. Â Standing next to my 5 year old daughter was a man who was taking pictures of the fish. He slowly moved his camera toward my daughter and pointed it right at her. She turned and looked at him not knowing what was going on and he took a picture of her! He was about to take another one when my wife stepped in front of the camera to block it and I confronted the guy and told him he should not be taking pictures of other people's kids. I then made him delete the picture and empty the recently deleted folder. While he was doing that I noticed a picture of a little girl and a picture of a naked woman. We take our kids out to the zoos and parks and never have I ever encountered anything like this and it just blew my mind that this was happening. I wish there was more security around so I could have reported him or had I not been there my wife could have flagged one down for help. This was one blemish on an otherwise awesome trip.
774,5/17/2017,3,"Seaworld is a great place to take the kids, there's a good amount of stuff to do. When I went the past two times, the shows were shut down and there was some construction so hopefully they have things open again because the shows are really fun to watch! Food is expensive there so pack snacks if you can :)"
775,6/4/2017,1,I came from far to get off my car and hear one of the staff name Beyonce talk smack how she don't want to park ppl cause they don't listen. Like everyone says you don't like your job then go look somewhere else. Ppl come here to enjoy with their family not to be hearing staff how they don't like their job. By having that job you would figure that ppl will not understand were you guiding them too. That it would be a bit challenging. It got me so upset that she was talking about a car that park behind us and they were elderly. Beyonce a heads up get a new job since you hate it here at sea world.
776,4/18/2018,4,"Loved going here with my family so much we ended up just getting year passes, great deal on them. The shows were great. The animals looked amazing I haven't been there in over 10 years and everything is EXACTLY the same (except for the orca show obviously) loved pineapple Pete's especially the funnel cakes. The kid area was great especially because I have a toddler and he loved it ."
777,11/29/2017,5,"This park has totally changed their vision and do extraordinary rescue work. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Recently, I dined with the orcas and Jose was the coolest! Excellent service. The coolest amusement park in SD!"
778,6/29/2015,5,"The summer nights is such a wonderful time to go! The Shamu evening show was great. Â We went to the Shamu dinner and it was was the best in all the parks in so. Cal we've been too. It was a nice private setting, small but very tasty buffet Â with lots to choose from. The food was very good, and the staff was so friendly (our waitress Katie was great) . Defiantly will go back next summer......my grandaughter Â had such a wonderful experience tonight!Oh, and if you book online you'll save $5 per person, and yes they have beer, wine and a few sig cocktails to order for purchase from your server, after you're seated...which is right away, get there a little early!"
779,4/17/2018,5,"It was our 1st time taking our 2 year old daughter and she loved it, Lots of fun things to do with your children here. We recommend this park if you have children. We made a small fun video showing some of the cool attractions we seen. youtu.be/L8Zkw8VmcLg"
780,10/31/2016,4,First and possibly last time here. The whole exhibit on the sea animals was beautiful. Â Dolphins kicked ass. but unfortunately wayyyy to many children running and screaming it was annoying. Strollers everywhere and some child is crying. As a single adult I'd love to come back to check it out on a day where there might not be many children.
781,4/5/2018,3,It was ok - definitely better than the last time I visited. The park's entrance is cool and I really like all the hands on activities with the touch pools at the entrance. We had purchased a food pass as well as front of the line for our day. The park is super clean and landscaping nicely done. The rides seem well maintained and I really liked the Sesame street addition for the kids. The best ride in the park is the Manta - that is a fun coaster - followed by Atlantis. The animal experiences is where it fell a little flat. I was expecting more aquariums and animals but we really didn't see a lot outside of the shows and touch pools. The staff around the park are hit or miss. I experienced more than one person who was clueless but also ran into a few who were super helpful.The food was about average for amusement park food but I would NEVER do the food pass again. It was a waste of money for us and the food not good enough to warrant the expense. We did have a nice time but feel that some places could've been more efficient.
782,2/19/2017,4,"This place is a gem, except for their prices, and hence only four stars. Â $17 for just the general parking, and $93 for a single-day entry at the gate. Â Other than that, the parking lot flows nicely, not like at a Costco. Â I've never come any rude staff members - sometimes they're not in a hurry, but they're still better than your typical Target cashier. Â There's a ton to do if you're they're all day, but again, the food, souvenirs, etc, will set you back a ton - $28 for three beers was my latest purchase! Â If you're tired of LEGOLAND or Disneyland, give this place a try!"
783,6/11/2015,4,Not bad.......Saw all the shows. The best one was the dolphins a close second was the seals and in third place was killer whales.For five dollers you can feed some seals which was fun.Its great for the kids and kids at hart .
784,10/15/2017,5,I enjoy seaworld and what they have done for our sea life. From rescues to education to fun they really do alot. Our daughter also loves the atmosphere and all the new rides. Thanks Seaworld
785,10/13/2016,1,"Four people. Second time. Nitetime.Bought two pack (one for 64.95, second visit free this year). Came all the way from NY for this and was not impressed. Didn't know they had chicken for sale. Bought over priced sandwiches. Nighttime came, we couldn't find much parking. Walked a long way to the park. Watched two or three shows and had to walk all over the park, missing the orca show. 3D simulator was okay. The end of day show had parodies of every other show, so at least got a sense of what it was. But animals were eh. Left and went to eat because we didn't want to pay anymore for food there. Map on website was the only star I could give."
786,2/3/2018,2,Definitely not worth the $89 I paid to watch enslaved animals. I would rather spend $10 more and enjoy the happiest place on earth. The first hour in was like a ghost town.
787,1/16/2017,4,We drove down this weekend from Washington for the weekend in San Diego. We went to enjoy Sea World.I took away a star cause the Sea Lion and Sea Otter show seemed a bit too much for our kids and crossed some lines for us. But overall the other shows we caught were good.
788,4/3/2018,3,"SeaWorld in Florida is way much better and worth traveling, San Diego SeaWorld is just like ordinary theme park."
789,9/25/2016,2,"The day started out great when we went on the spinning tower ride at the entrance, followed by a great sea lion show. The rest of the day pretty much sucked. The sesame street area is a joke, an old jungle gym and a few rides that you wait 15mins for, when the ride only lasts less than a minute, maybe even 30secs (no joke). One water ride was broken down and another spinning ride in the back of the park was broken. This leaves you with literally like 3 rides to choose from, all of which had 1.5hr waits, because the other rides were broken. Skip shamu show... Not much going on there. All of this and an outrageous ticket price makes me wish I had done something else with my time in San Diego... Anything else."
790,12/21/2015,4,"The Good.You only need about half a day to be able to get thru all the shows and individual animal exhibits. Â The park itself isn't nearly as large as you'd think, my husband and I (no kids) were able to see all the shows, and walk through all the exhibits in half a day.Sea Lion Show and Dolphin show are a must see for anyone looking to be entertained and awed. Â Penguins are adorable. Â Polar bears were cool too.The Bad.Aside from the animal shows, the animal exhibits were minimal but still worth Â No real ""wow factor."" Â The park itself is not nearly as crowded as you'd expect, but maybe that is due to less people looking to go to SeaWorld, and their high ticket pricing. The Ugly.Looking for a snack? Â Snow Cone? Cotton Candy? Churru? drinks? Â Good luck trying to find an open vendor during the weekdays. Â Every single food vendor/snack stand was closed. Â If you will not allow me to bring me my own food or drinks into the park, at least provide me with the ability to purchase snacks while at your park."
791,2/3/2018,1,"Should be called Sea Rip-off. Seventy dollars each to get in, extra charges for a number of attractions, half the park under refurbishment, and a limited number of shows with not enough seatings for the crowds. Greed, plain and simple."
792,3/24/2018,1,"What exactly is the ""submarine ride""? Seriously whoever greenlighted that awful ""ride"" should be fired. What a waste of money. I'd rather watch paint dry even my kid was severely underwhelmed by it. Sea world San Diego is garbage compared to San Antonio and Florida."
793,12/28/2014,4,"Having never been to sea world, I was pleasantly amused and entertained by this theme park. Pros+ HOSTS: Biff was so adorable. As a host of the sea lion shows, he entertains viewers prior to and during. the show. A family friendly character with little knacks and gags for the adult viewer as well (very aptly disguised), he is nothing short of a charmer and has a great stage presence.+ ANIMALS: the sea animals were very entertaining and adorable.+ WEATHER: I went to sea world in the winter (tip: sweater weather, dress accordingly) so there were virtually no lines for any of the rides. that was pretty awesome! Cons- STORE: predictably overpriced souvenirs resulted in me leaving without a souvenir in my pocket. With shows, spectacles and rides galore, its bound to be a fun day for the family, a cute date or get together with friends."
794,10/9/2016,5,Got the year pass. Â Based on Halloween season alone: 5 stars. Â They have some really cool halloween areas for the kids. Â And candy/trick or treat stations throughout the park Friday - Sunday.
795,3/27/2017,3,Most of the animals are wonderful and the park itself is very clean and well-staffed. I'm only giving it three stars because because the home for the larger animals is obviously very small. It's depressing to realize that the whales and dolphins are so cramped for most-if not all of their lives. I strongly thing Sea World needs to think about long term habitats and how they plan to give their animals the best lives possible
796,12/31/2017,5,This years Christmas show was awesome! It's nice to hear that Sea World is not afraid of doing a show about the real reason for the season. The birth of Jesus Christ! Thank you Sea World! The family and I enjoyed it! The animals in the show were so cool!
797,10/2/2014,1,"I came on the last weekend to redeem the free tickets. I wasn't expecting the crowd to be like the way it was, but I do understand since the tickets were free. My complaints about Sea World on the day I visited: 1. There needs to be clear signs about where to stand in line for those who had the free ticket vouchers. 2. I requested more workers to be standing around the entrance of the line, because so many people started to cut the line. Even after several requests, I did not see any workers. Management should have expected a large crowd and provided more employees to monitor crowds and answer questions. 3. Waiting for parking for 1 hour and in the line for over 2 hours to receive the tickets was brutal. The parking situation needs to be better. One employee should not be taking parking fees for two lines. 4. I was so excited to see the dolphin and Shamu show. Both were absolutely horrible. It's not what it used to be. Don't waste your time. Some Pros: Even though the line for tickets was very long, the park was fairly empty. I really enjoyed the Manta ride and the Sea Lion and Otter show. That's it."
798,6/18/2013,3,"I've always loved Sea World as a child and somehow, I always thought that it was larger. Â I remember being able to walk up to the side of Shamu's tank and stand there to watch him/her swim by. I used to put my hands on the glass and hoped that Shamu would swim right toward where I was standing. Those were the days!Sea World is relatively small but it has a lot to offer. They have different programs for people to truly interact with the animals. You can pay over $500 to engage in the dolphin interaction program or stand along the sides of dolphin tank/pool and hope that they will swim up to you. My niece was actually able to touch one of the dolphins when it swam toward us. She said that it felt like a ""dolphin"". Â That's about as descriptive as a two year old can be at this point, I guess. Anyway, I am so excited to see that they have added rides to the park. That makes it more entertaining for people who like a mix of rides, shows, and up close viewing of sea creatures. The shows vary in terms of the quality of the performances. Shamu's show is entertaining and I did get splashed by him/her. I sat in the second row of the soak zone and was drenched through every layer of my clothing. Thank my lucky stars that I had a complete change of clothes in my backpack. The dolphin show was okay but they disappear after about 5 minutes and then it becomes a theatrical performance that is entertaining but I came to see the dolphins. Â The Pets Rule show is super cute and worth sitting through at least once. I also had a chance to see Madagascar on its opening day and it is a pretty good show. It's geared toward the younger ones and since my niece enjoyed it, the show received 5 stars from me. Since my annual pass was free, I can't argue with the price. I come here once or twice a month and really enjoy myself. I just wish that the park was larger, had more rides, and had more opportunities for people to get up close and personal with the animals. We don't need to touch the animals but maybe they could build larger enclosures so that the animals have more space to swim around. It would be nice to observe them in a larger environment that is similar to their natural habitat."
799,2/21/2018,2,"The good:- It's an amazing park full of a ton of sea life, fun rides, etc. Read their brochure if you don't already know what they have.- They've improved the educational aspect of the park pretty significantly. It's not pure animal entertainment like it used to be.- They've made big strides in making the park more ethical after the controversy following Blackfish. It's a complicated issue, but my friends in the zoo industry tell me SeaWorld is doing pretty well now. They're AZA approved, and they agreed to stop breeding orcas (though they're keeping their existing orcas until they die naturally, since they can't survive in the wild).The bad:- They will milk you for every cent in your pocket after you're in the park. E.g. I paid $185 to interact with their beluga whales, which was amazing and wonderful, until at the end of the experience I learned it would cost me $90 to get digital copies of the photos they took (which only come on a CD, as if anyone still has a CD drive...). Guys, just charge everyone $20 more from the start and give everyone free photos (rather than just the handful of people who shell out $90)--you'll earn just as much and nobody will leave feeling gypped. I'd also rather pay a modestly higher entry fee in exchange for having affordable concessions in the park. Abusing a captive audience isn't going to leave people happy with their experience.- A few of their animal enclosures still feel degrading to the animals, even if they aren't necessarily harmful to them. E.g. the sea lion enclosure allows people to feed sea lions from above without much close supervision, and they're basically just begging and barking for food from everyone all day. I can't imagine people don't drop sunglasses and the like into the enclosure on a regular basis. I'd love to see a ground-level enclosure and safer and less degrading feeding methods."
800,5/18/2015,5,"I love Sea World. They had one in Ohio and closed it and it made me mad.I loved the Sea Animals, sharks and Shamu.I GOT TO EAT LUNCH WITH SHAMU! and it was good food! IT was a BUFFET all you can EAT! and a trainer told us about the whales and there was an Eagle you can see. (See my food pics) I didn't get to see everything but it's awesome to be around sea life!PLEASE don't let anyone make you think they are torturing the sea life here, it's a research facility that's open to the public. The animals are pampered and have grown up and were born in perfect conditions in this facility.I WOULD never have gotten to see these wonderful animals if it wasn't for Sea World. Keep doing what you are doing!"
801,7/20/2015,4,"First time at Seaworld where I wasn't a chaperone for a ""sea"" of tiny people. We rode the Manta like 57 times. In the pouring rain. NO LINES, baby!It really is a charming park. Glad we stopped off at COSTCO and got those cheap season passes, ya'all!"
802,4/4/2018,3,"The exhibits and shows are pretty cool. Well designed park. The employees leave something to be desired. Most of the customer facing employees are a bit ghetto. The weirdest encounter was when a lady literally stomped her foot in front of my baby's stroller ""STROLLERS ON THIS SIDE"" as she was referring to people going to the orca show, which I was not. I yelled back at her because of how surprising and aggressive and loud it was, but you dont put yourself in front of an infant's stroller like that. Just trashy. And frankly I'm kind of pissed. If you use the park map and can avoid the employees here you'll have a better time than we did."
803,12/8/2014,4,"I have been coming here for 21 years now. I remember having a sea world pass growing up and I would come almost every month with my mom. Seaworld used to be so much fun with their polar bear exhibit. I have noticed that there are no more polar bears. I also have watched blackfish and I have vowed never to see the shamu show anymore. This past Friday when I came I had a pleasant time. I usually watch the pet rule show because I love watching the pigs dogs and cats perform. Getting a turkey leg here is a must!You can find turkey legs near the ship wreck rapid ride. However it was closed on Friday but they did offer it in the Front of the park near coral store. I decided to watch the dolphins perform in their Christmas performance. Watching blackfish makes you realize how an orcas tank is too small for the environment they provide. Watching the dolphins perform in the front and watching them be kept in the back by a gate seperating from the front is hard to see. Yes these dolphins are small but they swim fast and they are use to swimming in an open sea. Before the show started I watch the dolphins swim in circles because that's how bored they were, could you imagine doing that?When you come to the gate of seaworld you are also greeted with a lot of protestors to free the orcas. Seaworld NEEDS to put the orcas back in the sea and maybe keep a couple dolphins and put them in the orcas tank. Seaworld has a lot of other cool things to offer as well. Since I was a little girl they have added tidepools to the front right when you enter. You can pet little sharks and crabs and my favorite are the cleaner fish! Cleaner fish basically gives you a free exfoliation on your hands. They all come to your hand and nibble away at your dead skin and your cuticles and make your hands feeling great. I really wanted to put my feet in that tank but that's illegal in the US. Before coming to seaworld I highly recommend you watch blackfish. I also recommend you get a turkey leg and you put your hands in the cleaner fish tide pool. You must ride shipwreck rapid, journey to Atlantis, and the manta ride. Going into the shark exhibit is always really cool it never gets old."
804,8/2/2018,1,They charge you to get in the park. Then we went to ride the sky tower and it was $5 per person. We skipped that and went to ride the Manta. We tried to get in line but they told us to go pay for a locker to put our backpack in. More money spent.
805,1/20/2018,5,"This is our second year being pass holders for Sea World. We come down once and month and are never disappointed. If you plan on going more than twice a year, a season pass is the way to go, it's less than the price of two tickets, you get discounts on everything, and the best part, FREE PARKING, which makes it worth it. The touch feel tanks are so fun and the employees are so knowledgeable. We love the Orca show, Dolphin show, feeding the Mantas, seeing the Belugas, Manta ride, and shipwreck rapids. The food is great, a little pricey but when you see the portion it makes sense. We always split something. The beer selection is great, and if you buy the refill cup is handy, we always bring ours back. We can't wait to come back in Feb."
806,8/19/2014,2,"It was just ok.The staff are NOT friendly. There was one lady who was nice at the Sea Lion stadium entrance and one lady by the sting ray petting area.Everyone else had a lack of friendly customer service experience. In fact, they were so sour I simply opted out of asking for help and purchasing anything.This was the guest relations staff, the front entrance staff, the food service staff, etc.I'm sure I didn't come in contact with everybody but how is it possible that I can be greeted by so many sour staff??The hands on area near the entrance was the best part. & The Orcas were cool to see. Like I said, it was just ok though. If you live close it's worth it. If you live far, find a local aquarium."
807,3/20/2019,5,"It had been years since I came to Sea world, I came this past weekend with my family. My family and I absolutely loved it especially my son. He was thrilled seeing the sea life and riding the rides. His favorite place was Elmo's world. I wanted to share a incident that happened, we went to go see the Orca show and left our refillable soda cup on the floor. As the show was over there was so much people exiting so half way before exiting the show I remembered about the cup so I went back to go get it and it was gone. I stayed after everyone left just to get more of a visible image of it and nothing. Someone took it. I asked the cleaning people if they had found it and they said no, so they advised me I go to guest services. I didn't want to make a big deal but it cost $14.99 for it and my son loved it so I didn't want to leave without it nor have to buy a new one. So I went to guest services and they were very helpful, they heard my situation and solved it immediately. They were so nice and attentive. Dan, the employee who helped me out was wonderful, he has great customer service skills, was so nice overall made my experience even greater for how the way he handled my issue. Beyond satisfied and so happy about it. I can't wait to visit again soon."
808,5/9/2017,4,I'm not used to go to all those touristic sites but this one was really astonishing!I felt bad for the whales tho but other than that worth the visit for sure!
809,7/15/2014,5,"- Locale Destination - It's in Sea World, San Diego. It's close to Downtown San Diego. Once you get off from 5 freeway, you drive sorta winding roads, but won't be lost. Tickets: Buy tickets online at seaworld.com - they offer $50/each (both adult & kid) weekdays ticket, which is a deal! I also got a parking for $1 off ($15). All you need is to show the barcode linked from your email confirmation. So get ready to scan the barcode at the entrance. Cool! Or you pay $86 for the day and the rest of year (sort of like an annual pass)! I think it's free for the military people - I didn't know SeaWorld is patriotic and/or a right-wing ;p (jk)*** Quick Queue ***Quick queue: If you paid extra $29.95 - unlimited front of the line admission at the following rides. All ride height and safety restrictions apply. Must show issued ticket for admittance. SeaWorld is smart to offer the ticket like this - Disneyland can't do that ;pJourney to Atlantis - *42"" (107 cm) or tallerWild Arctic - *42"" (107 cm) or tallerShipwreck Rapids - *42"" (107 cm) or tallerBayside Skyride - 56"" (142 cm) or accompaniedManta - 48"" (122 cm) or tallerQuick queue Premier: $39.95 - unlimited priority boarding at each of the rides above, AND reserved seating at select shows (One Ocean, Shamu Rocks, Blue Horizons, Pets Rule!, Sea Lions LIVE and Sea Lions Tonite). **********Parking: $16/day. You can get $1 off discount if you paid it online at Seaworld.com. You'll show the barcode linked from your email confirmation. You don't need to print it - get ready for it on your smart phone! They'll give you the receipt - you can get in and out from Sea World (parking) so long as you present the receipt. There're lots of places to eat around here - LOVE San Diego ;)Hours: The info on yelp app for the hours is wrong (it said 6pm, but was actually 10pm on the day)- I guess it depends on the season. I suggest to check their site first. Staff: Very friendly and helpful. But the service at restaurants is kinda slow. Best tips: Bring swim suit, sandals, towel, sweat shirt, poncho, hat, sunglasses, sun screen, frozen water, vinyl bags (for wet clothes and protect your valuable from water)! Â You'll get wet throughout the park, so wearing the swimsuit is the best thing here! You'll thank me - you're welcome :)- Gluttony Expedition - I haven't been here for a while - they stop serving bunch of beers for free ;( They still offer craft beers, but not free. Foods: Many theme park foods - pizza, chicken strips, tacos, fish&chips, burgers, funnel cakes, ice cream, fruit cups etc. The BIG portion and the quality isn't bad at all unexpectedly unlike many reviews. I think they did upgrade the quality. Drinks: If you paid $9 or so for their big cup, you can get a refill of drink for cheaper price. Aquariums: Bunch of small ones, yet cool ones. RIdes: From adults to kids. Really good and wide selections unexpectedly. You get wet on many rides. Shows: Pretty good. You should check them all out. You get wet. Exhibits: Lots of ""touching"" and ""feeding"" the creatures. Good varieties. Fun! - Conqueror's Deduction - For the price, they do offer TONS of cool and various stuff for every age - unlike ""Legoland""(it's only good for under 5 years old). Though it isn't as big as Disneyland, you can easily spend one day here trying everything they offer. It might be good to spend 2 days here - they have a lot to offer. It's really fun! Just wear swimsuits and sandals so that you don't need to worry about getting wet. Probably that's the best tip I could give you! You're welcome ;p"
810,7/17/2016,4,"We went during a Family n Friend's / PokÃ©mon Go / Military day on a Saturday and it was beyond packed. It took us 45 minutes to get from 1 mile out to inside the park! But, we got a killer deal which was $25/person for entrance, buffet lunch, and free parking.Because of BlackFish, the Shamu show isn't fun anymore. The trainers are not allowed to swim inside the tank anymore, like 15 years ago.Overall the shows are still fun to watch, sea animals are still interesting to see, and now there's a roller coaster and a log ride for the teenager groups.At every corner (for the adults) make sure to buy the refillable cups for margaritas and beers so you get a discount on the next purchase. Also, get a few of those churros while you're at it.Make sure to bring a portable cell phone charger because I'm 90% sure that you will run out of battery by the end of the day..."
811,1/26/2015,4,"Sea World has gotten such bad press about poor Tilikum and the dorsal fin prolapse of the performing orcas. Well, I think that was Florida Seaworld anyway. It is sad to see such droopy dorsal fins on such magnificent animals. I can't say if I would have any other opportunity to see these amazing creatures up close, besides here. Although, being along the California coast we have opportunities to see amazing sealife that we don't normally get a chance to see. The rest of the park was a lot of fun, everything from fast roller coasters and fun splash rides.There's a cool exhibit with the walrus and manatees, we didn't wait in line for the ride, but the viewing deck is just as much fun. The shark tank is scary and exciting. Â The underwater tunnel allows you to see from swimming from below and the moving platform assures that everyone gets a view. The penguin exhibit is packed with different species of those cute cuddling looking arctic creatures. The cirque de soliel show was closed on new year's eve but nevertheless, there was plenty of other shows to check out (seals, orcas, dolphins etc).We had a grand time, at the front just checking out the touching pools where you can see what the skin of a ray or shark would feel like. Plus there's plenty of gift shops, eateries, and rest stops to break up the day.Parking wasn't too atrocious for the holidays, but cold weather probably kept a lot more people away.Free admission to the park for military and their family once a year, is a really nice incentive to check out the place."
812,9/16/2017,1,Nope. Just nope. There's so little actual marine life in this park. I could learn more by looking at my fish tank. The new ride they have been advertising was closed. I went through the whole park in 2 hours and was over it. The new orca show had one showing and there is no longer an orca show. This place is pretty much a fish tank with a few rides and gift stores.
813,10/28/2014,3,"I'm not sure since when sea world became a semi-amusement park. The first time I had gone was in 2008 or so, and I had a blast seeing SHAMU. It was seriously the highlight of my day, and so went back hoping for some awesome whale watching activity. I was disappointed that the dolphin show, which I lined up for 30 minutes in advance, turned out to be a ""different from the usual"" event where I just happened to go to the last show, and have a speech on dolphin history. I was excited to learn something new, but was hoping to see some cool dolphin tricks. Â A lot of the other people around me were extremely disappointed, as it was the last dolphin show available. Also, I don't know if it's just me but the shamu show seemed much different. I was told hat it had to do with the fact that Shamu hurt someone who was a trainer, so now the trainers don't go in the water with the whales. Awwww, that does sorta suck. Seriously, the highlight of my trip was the turkey leg (first time eating it) which was amaaaaazing in flavor. My bf also said that he thinks it was the best he's ever had. I also had funnel cake with strawberry and whip cream, and it was hands down the best I ever had...and I'm comparing it to Magic Mountain and Coldstone Creamery (don't ask why i even did that). I hear it's ridiculously expensive to get in. I didn't pay for it, but it sounds like a lot. Also, right now they are having a promo of one adult ticket, gets any child between 3-9 for free. Hence, there were a million more kids than I last remembered.Cool thing, is there re Â trick or treating stations going on through out the park where you can get free candy. Would I go back again? Maybe if I have a kid."
814,12/9/2017,2,"They never contacted me. Which says how little they care about their guests. If they really cared, they would do everything in their power to rectify my bad experience at Tentacle Twirl. If their service is so ""top notch,"" why didn't I ever receive a phone call or anything from anyone?"
815,3/3/2016,4,"This place is pretty cool. $16 for parking. $21 for super close parking. The extra five isn't worth it. It's not that far. Just walk lazy. They open at 1000 and it's free for active duty. They close at 1700.The park is a big circle and it has what it's supposed to have. Whales, fish, penguins, sea lions, dolphins, polar bears, and aquariums. There are various show throughout the day with two showings a day. I didn't ride the rides as I get motion sickness but there are plenty of those too. I would say the gem of this place is definitely the Pets Rule show. Is got dogs and cats show. I was really impressed with what the animals have been trained to do. It's a fun show."
816,12/27/2017,5,There is so much to do and see!Can.t wait to go back.Great place...worth the $$.Sooooo loved the Navity musical.
817,8/1/2014,4,"Being a child at heart, I really enjoy my visits to Seaworld (omg, I just remembered they have these really big penguins that waddle around and they're so damn cute. I want one #dreambig). I actually had a terrifying experience here. There were flamingos walking around and the staff pushed the crowd back to a ""safe distance away""...two minutes later, I was legit in the middle of a flamingo stampede. If you think those pretty, fluffy, pink, just-going-to-stand-on-one-leg-like-it's-NBD, creatures are adorable, then you have never been through the troubles I have. Seriously, scarred for life. Aside from THAT hiccup, I haven't had a bad experience here. They have different shows going all day, which is a great to keep busy. I really enjoy the pet show (who let the dogs out? Woof woof woof woof!)...awesome. Also, they trained cats to do stuff. Yes, the same type of cat you have at home that will mockingly look at you as you call his/her name then walk the other way (don't worry, Seaworld proves that there's hope). The Shamu show is always a fun time. I don't think there has been a show that I was disappointed with. I went during the fall season once and some of their shows were Halloween themed, which was adorable. Their new ride Manta is also really fun! They have interactive exhibits and lots of creatures to see. You can definitely spend a full day here. I just reread this review and realized it made me seem like a total degenerate. Especially given the fact that this review is for a place geared towards children..."
818,7/2/2016,3,"Going here brought back memories of when I used to bring my Sunday School class here back in the day...Sea World has gotten a lot of negative press lately since the Shamu incident, but since I'm not really into animals (except when they are cooked medium rare) that type of info doesn't phase me.I will say this place is geared towards kids 10 years and younger. The Sesame Street area is like a lesser version of Bugs Land at California Adventure. We couldn't go on most of the rides because our kids weren't talk enough (bummer) and the circus and pets shows were good, but not mind blowing.I was surprised that the food and parking prices match Disneyland, yet Sea World is about 60% less cool. The AYCE deal for adults is worth it if you stay all day (we didn't). You can easily conquer the park in a half day visit depending on how many shows you want to see. It's not that busy and since my wife is a teacher we all got in free which was awesome. It's not that this place is bad, but I don't feel it's somewhere you could visit frequently and not get bored. If you love animals it's an upgrade from a zoo or aquarium, but not at the level of an amusement park.One suggestion for improvement would be allowed food inside. Disneyland allows it, so if Sea World wants to be in the conversation they should join the club too."
819,11/12/2016,4,Had a wonderful day here with the family! A beautiful day out under the sun watching very entertaining animal shows and seeing marvelous exhibits. Â I was completely amazed how well they train the animals. Â Everyone in my family enjoyed the day here.
820,9/30/2018,2,"The Halloween trick or treating stinked for kids! Â We are season holders and they told a line kids that had already been waiting ""sorry out of candy..we are closed"" They weren't out candy they were shut down by management. I know there is a timeline but there should be an SOP for every station..put a rope behind the last patron for example. It was really heartbreaking for some kids...way to go!"
821,12/18/2016,4,I always have a great time here. The only negative things I really have to say about sea world is that food and drinks are very expensive! Other than that everyone who works here is very welcoming and they know a lot about their animals. I am saddened that a lot of the animals are in such small enclosures... so supporting sea world is tougher. I think my favorite thing to do here is just play with the sting rays all day!
822,8/23/2014,5,"This is our second time being here and we still enjoyed it very much, this time we got the spend the whole day here and not in a rush... Not big on the rides but LOVED the shows, get the chance to see almost all. Very nice place to take the kids, friendly staffs, pretty clean park and they have alright food. Overall it was a fun time for the whole family to enjoy but in a bit of a hurry to keep up with the schedules. My all time favorite show is the sea lions but all of the shows are amazing. Â While on the manta ray ride I lost my glasses and reported to lost and found but never expected to get them back but in a week or so they are shipped to my house, that is pretty cool. Not a bad place to be at all, but I think for you to really enjoy all the park have to offer might need a good whole day or maybe even two.The whole family enjoyed it and we had a amazing time here."
823,10/7/2014,1,"I would give them zero stars if I can. Came here a few weeks ago to redeem the free tickets and they wouldn't even let us into the place. I had friends that came the previous week and got in fine. One of the guys told us that the reason why they were getting so strict was because they were losing money from the free tickets. I saw many families there holding their tickets frustrated at the managers because we were being punished by going so late within the month. One person offered us to give us a 50% off discount on the tickets while another only gave us a 30% off. Even though I wasn't going to pay either amount for the two hours I was going to be there, you guys should be at least consistent with what you guys are going to give your customers. I heard they were going to shut down this place by the next year. Well I hope you guys shut down by this year and allow the animals to be freed back into the ocean where they belong."
824,6/19/2012,4,"The HIGHLIGHT for us was DINE WITH SHAMU! ($33adult/$19child)yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦If you don't want to sit in the hot sun on the outdoor bleachers while you wait to see the Shamu show, purchase the ""Dine With Shamu"" program and you'll get:1. All you can eat lunch buffet-Fish, chicken, pastas, salads, pizza, chicken nuggets, desserts. It's not the greatest buffet but it is unlimited, and I always carry ziploc bags for the food that the kids can't finish (or the food that mommy wants to eat later, shh)2. One hour long program watching Shamu and friends do their show up CLOSE. You will get within 5 feet of Shamu and friends!3. WET. There is a good possibility that you may get sprayed a little bit.4. SHADE. It's so much nicer to watch the show in the shade. SO MUCH COOLER!5. Happy Kids. My kids were eating and watching the show. No whining. No fussing. Kids had food to keep them busy and whales to distract them from fighting with each other. The nuggets tasted just like McDonald's, and the pasta was perfect.Other tips for the rest of the park:1. The Sesame Street area was great for 2-7yr old kids - the rides, tree house/ropes made my kids tired! There is also the ""toddler pit"" if you have a tiny 0-2yr old.2. MUST DO THE SKY TRAM!yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦3. Try to download the SeaWorld app beforehand. I didn't have wifi so I couldn't download the app in time."
825,7/31/2012,5,"Thank you Sea World for the free tickets to active duty service members! Go to herosalute.com for information on free passes for a family of four!The last time we were here the Believe show was on and it was okay, the show we saw before that was amazing, but the most recent show that we saw over the weekend was sadly boring and not worth sitting in the hot bleachers for. The better show is down below from the viewing area where you could see the orcas up close. The manatees were gone! Â The only exhibit my son wanted to see and it was gone:( Â He settled on a book (thank God we found one). Â Not sure what genius made this decision but that was such a great exhibit!!Skipped the dolphin and sea lion show, opted instead to go to the tank and see them jumping up close as they were being fed.Overall very hum drum time, it was super duper crowded, parking was $25 for premium parking and we were in the front row so it was totally worth it. The rides were for bigger kids so our kiddos couldn't really take advantage of the new Manaray roller coaster. Â We didn't eat here except for the Shamu refill cup (lemonade slushy) and snacks like the Shamu ice cream. Â Got some cute souvenirs, a great photo and T-shirts. We'll be back I'm sure next year!"
826,8/7/2012,4,"My boyfriend and I went here two months ago. It was a really fun experience with a few changes since I last went back in January of 2011.I like the exhibits here including the Shark Encounters and Penguin Encounters. There was a lot to see. Also walking around and seeing flamingos, sea lions, and bat rays were pretty cool.SHOWS: Blue Horizons was just weird. It felt like I was watching Cirque de Soleil. People were just doing these crazy stunts in bird costumes, which was not what I was expecting. I wanted to see more dolphins but it felt like that only made up like 5 minutes of the show. The new Shamu show is alright, nothing too crazy, but I'd say it's good for photo opportunities. Be sure to check out the Sea Lions Live show which is very funny and entertaining. These sea lions sure know their tricks.RIDES:Manta is fun, fast-paced, and probably one of the smoothest rollercoasters I've ever been on. From the outside, it looks really slow but once you're on it, it's actually pretty fast. The seats were really comfortable so I can just sit back and relax I ended up screaming anyway).The Journey to Atlantis ride is the King among soaker rides. We were in the front so that didn't help. I did love the drops. It was a really fun ride.Wild Arctic is the cheesiest among cheesiest of rides. I got a giant headache afterwards. Unfortunately, that was our only gateway to see polar bears and beluga whales.STORES:They have really good merchandise here including really cute stuffed animals.FOOD:The food was alright. We had Mama Stella's Pizza Kitchen. I ordered the pasta which was pretty decent.Overall, there's a lot to see and experience at SeaWorld. I'd definitely come back here."
827,10/1/2014,5,"The animals are happy and healthy and the employees that work with the animals seem to enjoy their work. The shows are amazing. The kids scream with delight. I first went as kid when it was new in the early 70s and developed a love and empathy for marine mammals that I never would of had without the experience. Millions of others share my experience and will continue to.I thank SeaWorld and their employees and pets for the many wonderful experiences and memories. There are people in this country who want to destroy the families and homes the animals of SeaWorld know and love. My advice to them would be to point out they are feeding their dogs banal smelly food out of cans and containing them in tiny yards. Take your dog for a ride and ""set it free"" on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere if you want to ""help"" animals so badly.I for one love the pet show that features dogs and even a pig that SeaWorld has saved from shelters. if you want to be an animal messiah then go save the barn owl. The Federal Government is now shooting barn owls to protect spotted owl habitat and we have PETA to thank for that."
828,6/9/2016,4,"I'm gonna steal clear of the whole blackfish controversy because I'm sure too much of that is already going. I am going to focus on what it is though. It has lost a lot of it's flair from when I was a little kid in the 80s, but I think after that documentary they're playing it super safe and staying under the radar. The animals do less spectacular tricks and shows seem pretty short, but again, they're playing it safe.Nonetheless, it's still a great park. It makes my gf because she gets to see the dolphins and belugas which are her favorite so which means it makes me happy. It's relaxing, and a good walk but without overly tiring yourself out on hiking and long line waiting, which can be exhausting in itself. Also, they offer great discounts if you are tech savvy and look for them so a little research online goes a long way.My greatest tip for this place is to invest in the All-Day-Dining package for $34.99. It allows you to eat a full meal once every hour. It's totally worth it!! It's not even a hidden deal, it's just a deal! Simply, if you stay 12 hours then you get to eat 12 meals, which is more than enough. My wish is that other amusement parks would follow suit. Knott's, Disneyland, Six Flags, where you at? If Disneyland wasn't so about money, money, money then this would be a definite no brainer deal. I don't know about the other two parks but this is the first time I've seen a deal like that. Of course you are limited to certain restaurants, but nonetheless, if you like food then the cost will easily make up for itself. I may renew my pass next year for this deal alone. So is it what it used to be? Absolutely not. Is it an enjoyable park? Absolutely. Not only that but it's relaxing and won't break the bank either. Sorry Disney. I like you, but you are the more stressful park to be at with your long lines, pricey foods and snacks, and your rat race just to get through the park. I'm older now so I'm about the leisure and relaxation, but most importantly and I will reiterate this again: Happy gf equates to me being a happy camper."
829,8/30/2014,4,"So after a long day of being at Sea World all day on a Saturday, overall it was great! Â Especially on Labor Day weekend, I know it's risky because a lot of people go to these theme parks during extended weekends. Â Getting there early definitely helped us a lot to see a lot of attractions and avoid long lines on thrill rides.However, there are a lot of shows designed to accommodate a lot of people all at once and I couldn't believe there was enough room for everyone to see the cool sea animals.The Mania roller coaster had a 30 minute wait while I was there and there was a section dedicated to young toddlers, of which my son had a blast for over two hours. Â It was a bouncing little air floor with building blocks.During lunch we ate the Calypso BBQ grill and it was delicious. Â It was better than you'd expect for most theme parks. Â The chicken, brisket, and ribs combo is what we had and all of it was good. Â Every part of the park always seemed to have dedicated staff on top of cleaning messes which I can appreciate, because the whole theme park was overall very clean.I would come back, but maybe during a less peak busy time so the crowds weren't as annoying. Â Overall, I was very satisfied and glad there was also a system / staff dedicated to dealing with parking arrangements. Â Price for parking is outrageous, but that's how these amusement parks make there money."
830,2/10/2018,5,Great family activity. Many performances throughout the day and rides for younger ages and petting Water-world animals.
831,3/24/2018,4,We took out 2 year old and 4 year old for their birthday on a Thursday. I was surprised that it seemed that only 2 food places and 2 concession stands were open. The staff was friendly and seemed knowledgeable. My boys enjoyed seeing the whales. There's kids areas and teeny small rides that they enjoyed and that killed in our time in between shows. We will likely go again sometime.
832,8/31/2018,5,"First time to SeaWorld found the website to be very confusing and off-putting and almost didn't attend based on the difficulty and navigation and actually learning what was at the park and what there was to do so that was a huge miss! However if you struggle through the confusing website and actually can figure out that you want to go you will be more than pleasantly surprised at all the great stuff you get to see!! It was well worth the price of admission, it was fun, you can set your own pace there are many shows demonstrations behind-the-scenes looks you don't need to spend a lot on the up charges to really have a great time. I was surprised at all the good things that SeaWorld does in the community and happy part of my admission actually goes to helping rescue animals. The dog and cat animal show was very fun, of course the killer whales and dolphins are a must-see I also like the otter show and especially the pre-show to the otter show with a guy doing a mock singing routine so make sure you get early to that one. There were a number of nice surprises along the way as well. The food was expensive but we actually got good portions and good value for what we spent. All in all a great day."
833,7/29/2018,5,"I was at the penguin exhibit and I went to the gift shop the girl helping me was named Jessica she was very friendly, kind and polite. She helped me find a gift for my little sister and was very helpful !"
834,12/31/2017,1,SeaWorld should rethink the animal shows. I made it to the dolphins presentation and it was sad to see humans riding dolphins. Don't intend to come back.
835,7/8/2016,4,"We have not been back here for at least 10 years. I thought the overall experience was great:1. Ticket Price: We bought advance tickets online and paid $70.00 per person. Regular price was $90.00 which I thought was sort of steep considering you can pretty much do everything within 6-7 hours. 2. Parking: Parking is nowhere as organized as Disneyland but decent. The parking staff was made up of a bunch of high school kids. They charge $17.00 per car and $25 for premium parking which I thought was a little bit elitist but money can buy you lots of things, right?3. Shamu Show: The show is now very different from what it used to be. I guess SeaWorld over the years has received a lot of complaints from the PETA and other crazies. Then there was that movie ""Black Fish"". Plus, there was a couple of incidents involving the killer whales going rogue on their trainers so now the show is totally about educating the public. You know what I am talking about...""We love our killer whales...we take care of our killer whales...they love us...blah blah blah"". Everyone knows that people watch this show for 2 reasons: To get wet or to watch other people get wet. Oh yeah, they like to watch the whales jump around, too. 4. Other Shows: The dolphins/sea lions/sea otters/pet shows were pretty cool. Some have had their scripts updated. The hands-on exhibits were great for the kids. The aquarium are always wonderful. I especial love the Shark Exhibit. They need to keep the glass window clean in the Penguin Exhibit. It gets pretty frosted-up with the low temperatures. Â 5. Souvenirs: Yes, the dreaded-tourist traps!! Stores that contain useless junk that your kids will beg to buy but as soon as they get in the car, these made-in-China items are soon forgotten. Having said that, we were pleasantly surprised that the prices were pretty decent. I wish that would have less of the plastic-junk and more of the quality shirts and stuff. In doing so, I guess they would be getting into the Disneyland-type of prices where you need to get a mortgage to buy one of their t-shirts. Â 6. Extra-expenditures: There are numerous restaurants and kiosk selling all sorts of food. They are sort of expensive but expected. We brought our own lunches and snacks. The park is pretty cool about letting you bring in food. There is a large area where they have all sorts of carnival-like booths and games. They are money-pits. Do not let your kids know this place exist!! All in all, I thought the visit was great. I would not recommend the annual pass though because you would not want to visit more than once (maybe twice) per year. There is not really that much to see and do."
836,8/29/2018,5,Came here with my family during our vacation. We had a wonderful time. They had plenty of rides for my niece and nephew. I loved their dolphin show. They had a roller coaster name electric eel that was fun. The animals we saw were amazing (my favorite were the walruses) And they had a good number of the beer stands all over the park. It was very enjoyable and hope to come back someday.
837,4/12/2016,1,"Although it pains me to go into detail about my experience at SeaWorld, I would rather be detailed about my experience than not say anything about it.I love animals, especially wild ones. When I went to San Diego's infamous Sea World, just like many of the other tourists, I was left in awe. It is truly beautiful, you see all sorts of marine animals, despite the fact that they are in tiny, bathtub like cages. I went over to feed the dolphins, and I kept buying fish because they were hungry and it's really cute to feed dolphins. However, noticing blind dolphins, ones with NO teeth, and marks on their body completely broke my heart. As much as I would love to be around these gorgeous animals, I would never have the heart to support such cruelty. The food was entirely overpriced. Everything there is seriously overmarked, starting from their souvenir store and ending by their ""feed the dolphins"" shop. It pains me that these animals are starved so humans can throw fish at them. My sister and I love dolphins and we enjoyed playing with them, but I immediately felt terrible for leaving them since they still had their mouths open, waiting for food.What pained me the most was walking towards the whale show and seeing the orcas. I remember being in awe but slowly noticing disturbing facts: bended fins, drilled teeth, and marks on their body, since I was sitting in the front. It was fascinating to see these animals up close and the 1 star on this review is for the beauty of these extraordinary creatures.Side note: the staff of Sea World means well. I saw it by their performance and their love for the animals. However, these animals, especially the dolphins and orcas, are social creatures and even though they like being around humans in the WILD, it is not healthy for them to be confinment, and definitely did not look ""fun"" for them. It was odd to sit on uncomfortable, wet seats. When sitting for the show, I actually started crying because it reminded me of circuses, the fact that the trainer was riding the poor orca. And again, I do not think the trainers are trying to harm the animals. I just do not believe that mistreating the animals are good for their business let alone for the well being of the ""stars of the shows,""In terms of parking, their parking lot is way bigger than the tanks for the orcas. And upon closing, I was stuck in traffic. It makes me sad to observe this, but I don't believe that the Sea World crew actually intends to hurt the animals. However, seeing the creatures like this make me never want to return. If I'm paying a lot of money for tickets, I don't want to feel like I just paid money to support cruel capitivity of animals.Furthermore, after that visit, I regret going. The dancers of the orca show were extremely talented and fun to look at, but the innocent animals being forced to do tricks did not compliment the ""show."" I would love and recommend Sea World to many others if they allowed the animals to be as close to nature as possible. Above all, it is extremely expensive; whatever you do you can't go on a budget unless you plan on missing out on a lot of the ""perks."" I pity this business because it does not care about their customers let alone their residents. The only thing they care about is making people pay triple the price for tickets, food, drinks, and souvenirs."
838,5/12/2014,1,"I was lucky to have not paid the outrageous admission. My friends ex works one of the shows at sea world so he was able to get us and the kids in Free. Free is good and all of the times I visited San Diego no one ever wanted to go with me. I have lived here for a few years and still no one wanted to go to sea world. Why did the locals not want to go? Because they know what's good and what isn't. Dead sea world is a rundown overpriced outrages joke of a theme park. If you decide to support these inhumane extortionists and go anyway, well you should pack your lunch and bottled waters accordingly because if you get thirsty, a bottle water is like $10. I know because I drank all of mine, it was a hot day. So I had to buy one well let's just say my wallet hurt. They have nothing but unhealthy food options that are extremely overpriced. If you have any type of a food allergy be sure and bring your food with you because you will have no options and end up starving.That said, yes I did see the killer whale show and I did feel sorry for the whales. Blackfish was out but I had not seen the movie nor heard of it until after my visit. Â I was so ashamed that I went there I didn't want to tell anyone I actually went after I saw the movie. Today I saw a story of the oldest orca in the wild that they have been tracking. It is 103 years old I remember the sea world employee telling us that the Orcas in captivity lived really long lives up to 20 or 30 years that's not a long life compared to the wild and a lie.Anyhow I am here to talk about my visit at the park and try to give and unbiased opinion regardless of that movie. I felt sorry for more than one animal there. The otters and puffins seem to be enjoying themselves and that did look like a pretty cool environment for them. My favorite part was the pets rule animal show. I love how the cats did all the tricks they were the stars of the show. That show should be renamed cats rule! However we got to go backstage being VIPs after the show and saw how these animals that did all these amazing tricks lived after. Shoved into these tiny cages and a very filthy looking environment and I was not impressed in fact I felt sorry for them too. These animals should be stars and treated with star treatment they were clearly not. I don't know if you've seen the Humane Society but they have great rooms with Trees and all kinds of free roaming environment these conditions were like a bad animal shelter in a podunk town. Such a shame. I was actually contemplating stealing a couple and rescuing them right there on the spot.Personally I was disgusted with it all the way around.I will never ever go again and I ashamed I went."
839,11/26/2016,3,"Dolphin show was fun, but Shamu show wasn't available. Â Way too many places were closed. Â I don't know if this was due to the season (Nov 22) or what. Â They ran out of maps because they ""ran out of ink for their printer that morning"". Seriously, they print their maps daily?? Â Place felt too commercialized, seemed like every other building was a gift shop selling the same thing with slight variations on some theme items."
840,7/7/2017,4,"I used to always go here as a child so it has a special place in my heart. I finally went back yesterday and was pretty impressed. The tickets are around 90ish dollars which is a little high I feel for what this place is but since I frequent San Diego I opted for the fun card which made it worth it. The shows are my favorite part, especially the new Illuminight show. And I love that the park isn't so huge that it takes you forever to get from one part to the next. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because some of the workers clearly do not want to be there, and you can see it in their attitude."
841,10/22/2017,5,Chris is an employee with frosted hair. Â He was on break and in line with us at explorers cafe. Â He heard my daughter puzzled over what to get and he engaged with us and was telling us about the pizzas and how good the burgers were etc. anyway. He was on break and didn't have to participate but did. Kudos Chris.
842,2/19/2018,3,"The day i went, 2 of the main rides were closed, I liked how there weren't alots of people on the weekdays, went through the whole park and shows about 4-5 hours. in the end i think it was not worth $70 but more like $50. I thought it was going to be bigger but seems a little bit small. I would recommend going for the first time there but i dont think i would go back again, Dont get me wrong, I went with my gf, just 2 of us, so one time is enough for me."
843,3/8/2018,5,Amazing time. The all day dine deal is worth every penny. The sky tower was down and they never got the Atlantis water ride up and running. Bummed about that. The kids had an amazing time though. Thank you Orcas for the splash!!!
844,8/5/2018,4,"Always a wonderful experience when coming to sea world . This was the first time my daughter has been and she enjoyed it so much . All of the shows were great , the food was GREAT and wait time for rides were not that long . I would recommend this place to any family to visit . Although the orca show was not the best as I've seen it before , it was still enjoyable and I'd watch it over and over again"
845,9/4/2012,3,"I have been to SW many times over the past several years, and it seems as though every time I've gone, it's become less and less exciting. And for over $70 a pop? I don't know how families could afford entrance these days. When I was a kid, our fams went all the time especially when relatives came to visit and it was soooo much fun. Now after watching the shows, I've become less interested and intrigued with the animals. There were a couple shows that were cool, but corny. The shows are not as interactive as before. Now that the trainers cannot enter The Shamu Shows, it's not the same. The killer whales barely do any tricks and they basically just splash people. I guess the kids still dig the shows and perhaps when I do have kids, I'll enjoy SW more. Being with someone that has a VIP card does have it's perks however. (Free admission anytime for a year, free parking, and discount on food/drinks.)"
846,4/26/2018,1,The Manager Bethany is not for customer service! Â Came to SeaWorld with my family. We bought the all day dining at lunch time figuring we would eat dinner before leaving the park. Well come to find out the map we got had the wrong park hours and by the time we wanted to get dinner all the participating restaurants were closed. We complained at guest services and the manager Bethany instructed the cashier to call the restaurants to find out exactly how much everything cost so they could deduct it. 45 minutes later the poor cashier was still trying to figure out the costs all because the manager asked her to deduct every penny. We spent more than $400 and they want to count every penny of what we ate. Bad customer service!!!
847,9/3/2017,2,"We purchased a two-day pass back in April. Back then, half the attractions were closed, due to the new attractions that were opening up in the summertime. We were able to do what was the remaining attractions. It seems that there are less animal exhibits than when I went as a kid. The main attraction also has changed dramatically - it's now a big screen and less live interaction with the audience, which I found disappointing. There seems to be a lot of junk food restaurants and retail shops everywhere you turn. The food at the restaurants is abysmal and expensive. For instance: we ate at Mama Stella's Pizza place, and they didn't even have pizza as a choice for the kids menu, forcing us to purchase an adult meal for my child. The food was terrible there as they served the main course in a to-go box. I wanted hand-scooped ice cream, but there is nowhere in the park that serves that. One place serves soft-serve, and the rest of the park serves the less desirable overpriced 'Dippin' Dots' and pre-packaged ice cream. None of the places have free refills for drinks. And some of the attractions you have to walk a mile to get to due to construction, even in the summertime. They shot off fireworks at 10pm, closing time, which I found to be too late if you have kids. Somebody needs to get it together and make this park better. What a shame."
848,10/29/2017,1,I have been an annual member for years now with my entire family. Â So last week some child pooped in the fountain area and no one did anything about it for 2 hours. Â Children were barefooted walking in human feces as it squished between their little toes. Â So gross and while employees knew nothing was done. Â Finally some employee went to scrape it up with his bare hands. Â We almost puked. Â Shame Shame Shame on Sea World and they profess to protect our world's endangered species ? Â OMG
849,8/10/2016,4,"The only thing keeping back a 5 star rating was the fact that the Journey to Atlantis was broke down. Have visited twice this year and not running either time. To k=make matters worse, they had no sign or host there telling people the ride was down, people would walk clear through the entry maze and then find out.Overall Sea World is always great otherwise. Crowds were not too bad and the shows top notch of course."
850,6/16/2016,4,"My kids really enjoyed SeaWorld! Â In fact, they liked it more than the San Diego zoo. Â I think the reason is because at the zoo, all you can really do is walk around and look at animals. Â That was interesting for a while but then they probably had enough of just walking and looking. Â What made SeaWorld more fun is that they didn't just have cool sea animals on display (like polar bears, dolphins, sea lions, beluga whales, walruses, etc.), there were also way more activities for the kids. Â For example, they had a number of rides (one of the water rides that had a large drop even scared ME!). Â There was also the Sesame Street play area where my kids got to run around and play. Â In addition, they had a large tower where we got a complete 360 degree view from several hundred feet up. Â We also paid a little extra to ""dine with Shamu"" (my wife's favorite part). Â Let's face it, you're not paying for the food (it wasn't that spectacular) but you're paying to be right next to a large killer whale. Â We were so close, I could almost touch it (darn protective glass!). Â But at least it made for some great photos. Â And my daughters' favorite was the large basin of cleaner fish right when you walk into the park. Â You put your hands in and they would nibble at it. Â I believe it's the same fish they use at spas to clean your skin. Â My girls couldn't get enough. Â We had to keep coming back at least 4 or 5 times. Â I guess it's the simple things that make them happy.The main thing I didn't like was the prices. Â It cost close to $500 just to enter the park (with the ""dine with Shamu"" option). Â In addition, we had to pay for parking ($16 for regular parking or $21 for ""up close"" parking). Â Really? Â We also had to pay to feed the sea lions. Â It was $5 for 4 anchovie-sized fish. Â Be careful because there are aggressive birds around who will steal that fish if you're not cautious. Â We ended up buying $20 worth of fish because some of the birds stole our fish! Â And if you want to use the drying machine after you get wet from the water ride, it's $6.My kids really had a lot of fun though so I guess that's the most important thing! Â I would recommend anyone to try it at least once."
851,5/18/2014,3,"I remember as a child, I love coming to San Diego and going Seaworld. Now 20 years later, I'm a teacher and I get to get in for free for the whole year! Â Unfortunately, this place lacks rides and shows. Â We came here in mid May and there were only 5 shows to see. Â I wish SeaWorld would give us more shows and create some more rides."
852,4/11/2017,1,"For all potential visitors to this so-called aquatic park, please watch the following 2 documentaries:1-THE COVE2-BLACKFISHI was horrified after I saw these 2 documentaries. It never hurts to learn something new, and believe me, it's everything BUT a waste of your time to watch the above documentaries. I can't believe that Seaworld spies on animal rights organizations by disguising Seaworld employees as animal activists. Seaworld shipped off a polar bear to a zoo, and the bear's partner died. Seaworld is EVIL.  I visited Seaworld many years ago, and was disgusted, traumatized, horrified, and appalled by the physical appearance of the aquatic wildlife. The animals were swimming frantically in small spaces, had scars all over their bodies, and looked woebegone. I did NOT have a good time! I did not enjoy ANY of the shows! I did not enjoy seeing depressed, scarred, and traumatized animals in small spaces, when they should have the entire ocean to play in.It's tremendously sad that humans incarcerate animals for their own personal enjoyment. If I had the power, I would shut down all zoos and abhorrent organizations like Seaworld, and let the animals go free. Some would die in the wild, but that's nature. For those of you who say that Seaworld is ""saving"" animals, and they would be dead if they weren't in Seaworld's so-called ""care, I say that they would prefer to die in their own natural habitat than have to endure confined spaces for the rest of their lives, be depressed, and trafficked for the enjoyment of humans. After I visited Seaworld, I sent them a letter, and they were so incredibly stupid and in denial, that they had the nerve to tell me that they take ""care"" of the animals, and that they exceeded some bull shit standard. I, along with every other individual with an ounce of common sense, do not buy that rhinoceros manure for one nanosecond.I am jubilant that Seaworld has lost many lawsuits and is currently facing many others. Seaworld lost a lawsuit against Occupational Safety & Health Review Commission (OSHA). Seaworld tried to dismiss another lawsuit regarding its false advertising about the so-called ""care"" that it provides to its poor unfortunate killer whales, but the judge wouldn't dismiss it. I was in a state of rapturous excitement when the movie Blackfish was released to the public, so that everyone on planet earth could see for themselves the horror that these poor animals have to face on a daily basis. I am crestfallen that Seaworld's doors have not been shut yet. It's because they are fighting with tooth and nail to keep their aquatic prison open.Ever since the last time I visited Seaworld, I vowed never to return, and guess what? I HAVEN'T, and NEVER WILL! Even if the world comes to an end, and the last safe place on earth is Seaworld, I won't step one foot in this man-made aquatic prison. I anxiously look forward to the day when Seaworld suffers so many lawsuits, that their doors shut, and they only become a distant memory, or perhaps just another legal case for law students to discuss. I will probably receive a response to this yelp review by some uneducated neanderthal from Seaworld about how ethical they are, how they hold themselves to high standards, and other worthless bull shit. When I read the other 1-star reviews, the response from Seaworld is the epitome of worthless garbage. Users mention how the facility smells and is dirty, then Seaworld responds saying how the cleanliness and well-being of their animals are their #1 concern. Well if it was their #1 concern, then why doesn't it show??????? Why are the facilities dirty and smelly you morons? If they cared about the animals, then why does it look like they couldn't care less????? I guess Seaworld is so incredibly stupid that they really think they are mending the situation by posting a pathetic response like that. WOW! Human beings need to adopt more effective, ethical, and humane methods of earning a living, not imprisoning innocent animals. If I want to see aquatic wildlife, I just rent a TV show on iTunes from Planet Earth, narrated by David Attenborough. It's more enjoyable, and I get to see animals in their natural habitats, free, happy, and undisturbed by uneducated human debris. ***Update: pay attention to the ignoble response below by guest services. They used an en dash after the word ""opinion,"" which is to separate dates (e.g. 2010-2011). Evidently, guest services at Seaworld are too doltish to know that they should've used an em dash, which is longer than an en dash, and it's used to add an additional thought. Also, my ""opinion"" has been substantiated by all the lawsuits Seaworld has lost as well as the documentary Blackfish. Poor pathetic Seaworld and its uneducated neanderthalic staff who don't know how to use the proper dash in a sentence. In my opinion, Seaworld's record is unequivocally that of MORAL BANKRUPTCY and STAGGERING HYPOCRISY."
853,1/3/2018,3,"We have a three year old. Great age for those looking for a day trip. Sesame street kids area has fun rides. I will say that she can not go on everything as the area is built for ages 5-11. There are bigger rides for teen and adult such as roller coasters in another area. Lots of sea life touch pools when you walk in. The Pet Show is a favorite show of hers and liked the sea and Otter Show and the Dolphins. An important thing to know. There are places in the park to get pictures with shamu or Sesame Street characters or at holiday season time Santa. They have hard copy prints available and digital. BOTH times I have gone, ordering the digital prints was a HOT MESS. No one selling you the prints knows how to download it and someone from guest services had to cross across the park to do it ( 30 minutes to get that picture) the second trip they said I would receive an email of the picture and if there are problems call guest services. I never received shot and I called the number on the receipt for three days and no one ever answered or called me back! Only because I happen to KNOW an employee who worked there. I personally sent a picture of receipt to him and two weeks later just got the pictures and that was because I knew someone. I think if I didn't my $20 would be down the drain. They seriously need to revamp training and how to get digital pictures. Both times I purchased it was an utter nightmare so order the prints and if you must have the digital DO NOT LEAVE THE KIOSK UNTIL THAT DIGITAL IS ON YOUR PHONE. They really could use from pointers on this from Disney. Whoever is in charge of training merchandise should make everyone in training download a digital picture from Sea World AND seriously they people they use that created the download website is super I user friendly. Hot mess. Really love your photo and Â get a print or happily skip it!"
854,6/3/2016,2,"Not impressed. I'm sure it's great for kids that are in awe over everything, but I'd much rather head up the road to the zoo, as I feel they have more visual stimulation there. Many things closed on a Friday... You'd think prices would range from day to day based on what they have going on."
855,11/10/2014,4,"Nice park, I have been here twice with my family and we had great time here, we really enjoyed the Shamu show and dolphin show, they were awesome!Shows are 20 mins to 30 mins, but for get a good sit you better to come early, it usually have long line there at the entrances. We saw a lot of cute animals here. For SHamu show, you may get WET, so be careful with your camera/cell phone.Tickets are expensive, like $80+ per person, and parking have extra charge."
856,9/28/2012,4,"What's not to love about Sea World. I love watching the sea otters, sharks, penguins and wild arctic. Even petting the bat rays is amazing. Over the years they have added more and more rides, that are a great addition. Manta and Journey to Atlantis are my favorites. Shamu, Blue Horizon, Pet's Rule and Seymour and Clyde are some of the great animal shows you can't miss. Some are better than others, but they are all worth seeing while you're at the park.If you go, be sure to wear sunblock and have fun!"
857,6/6/2014,3,Shipwreck rapids is the most exciting ride I went on here. Lol you get soaked. Fortunately there is giant dryers/heaters that help dry your clothes. But it's 5 bucks and it was 10 bucks for a cold brewskie. If you bring the cup back for another round you get a dollar off.Buy the Sea World refillable cups they are like 9 dollars but you can get refills for a dollar on soda or any other type of refreshments. The sea otters and dolphins show is great to watch. Some of the shows incorporate the performers demonstrating their tremendous acrobatic skills jumping off from up high into the water.The whales will get you wet if you are in the splash zone they will wag their giant fins more than an excited dog waiting for his treat. LolAvoid eating the burgers here. They're blegh. Get BBQ instead more worth the money.
858,5/1/2014,4,"My family visited Seaworld during the holiday season, so this review is a bit overdue. First off, I love the SD area, but they really need to improve SAN airport. Its becoming a cluster you know what...Ticket pricing was reasonable and comparable to other amusement parks in CA. What I fail to understand is charging for parking. Just build it into the cost of admission and call it a day. Unless there are alternatives (or located in the heart of downtown) parking should be included. They might as well start charging for using the restrooms. I digress.My 3 year old daughter absolutely loved this place, and the park comes alive during the holidays with lit Christmas trees all over the place. She especially liked the separate playground for tots, and the Sesame Street character side shows. Daddy enjoyed the arcade games, but spent a fortune trying to win a stuffed animal on the claw. Mommy won the ring toss after $5, and we took home a huuuuge Shamu. We left it in the stroller outside Shamu Stadium while watching the show, and was delighted that nobody stole it.Park is clean, bathrooms are clean, but was disappointed with the quality of the park food, especially for what we paid.And don't hate me but I don't know what the fuss is about with the killer whales. From my seat, the are treated very well and are fed all the time. Yes, they are in captivity, but have you ever been to the zoo lately? Or how bout the neighbors dog chained up in the back yard? Anyway, this place is a definite must visit if you are in socal."
859,9/10/2017,5,Sea world has gone through so many changes and so much grief over the years but honestly I love the direction they are taking in this day and age. They are adding more amusement for those who feel they need the adventure and thrill from a park and many of the shows are returning to the educational roots that sea world had. I love absolutely love the new orca experience. I'm simply saddened by the fact that my great grand kids won't get to see & learn about so many of these majestic animals.
860,8/19/2018,4,"I get that Sea World is now limited on what attractions they can offer because of laws that are now in place regarding sea life. They make it work the best they can and it shows. This is not the Sea World I grew up with and I can't expect it to be in this day and age. The value is awesome. Very affordable, so families appreciate that. My son is two and had the best time, not only with sea life interactions but on the rides and the Bay of Play as well. The parade far exceeded our expectations. So why not 5 stars? We rented a stroller (online for $15.00 another plus) and when we got there we had to deal with Clyde. You would think that because this guy has an extra chromosome he would be extra nice, but no. He hates his job and it shows. Also the food was horrendous but we didn't go there for the gourmet meals."
861,10/19/2016,2,"Two stars, why, maybe it's not sea world but my own expectation, I been wanting to come to sea world ever since I was a teenager.Park hours 10:00am to 5:00pm so I figure lets be an early bird, huge mistake everything opens after 12:00pm, but ok that's fine, get to know the park.The park not much to see since everything was close, even places to eat in the morning.There wasn't not much animals to watch or interact.Overall it's not worth paying 93 dollars per person, got that kind of many go to Disney or Legoland.Not even the killer whales are worth that money, of course they are worth more than that but still."
862,6/3/2018,5,"My family and I have always enjoyed visiting Sea World SD. Unlike other parks which I won't name but are located in Anaheim, SW is actually reasonably priced, making it feasible for single income families to enjoy, specially those of us with small children. I don't know about other kids but my two yr old has trouble waiting in line for over an hour just to ride a 3 min attraction, and we've never had to wait that long for anything here (not even on busy days). And last but not least SW has allowed my children to see up close and in perwon animals that otherwise would only be seen on in books or tv."
863,8/18/2018,5,"One of the loveliest place in San Diego and I love the performances there. Such as dolphins, sea lions and other animals"
864,8/11/2017,4,Great spot. Vey Culture friendly. A theme park without rebel flag totting customers cause they cant afford it. Had lunch with Shamoo. Daughter and I had a great time. Loved the Stingray coaster
865,5/30/2016,5,"The entire SeaWorld staff contributed to this five-star review. Their combined efforts delivered a perfect day for my daughter and me. Â Most instrumental to this perfect day was Sharifa, who, to my great fortune, helped us at the park's customer care desk. Thanks to her intelligence and warm, caring professionalism, Sharifa took what could have been a cluster-mess of a situation and turned it into the beginning of a perfect day. When I bought the tickets online, SeaWorld's website scrambled my order. It resulted in my card being charged twice, with one charge attached to the correct date but the wrong 'add-on' event package, while the other had the correct 'add-on' events but the wrong dates. So when we arrived, I had to go to the Customer Care office to straighten out the errors. Â Getting the correct package was especially important because we were driving in from L.A. to meet friends with whom we had coordinated activities (such as the dolphin encounter) throughout the day. Â I was prepared for the worst -- figuring that we'd either be allowed admittance but not given the package that allowed us to sync our friends' schedule, or we'd be told we could have the correct package but that we'd have to come back on a different day to redeem it. Â Hence why I have such gratitude for Sharifa. Â We've all dealt with customer service representatives who collapse when presented with process glitches that are obvious to the human eye yet are tricky to reconcile against exception-resistant computer systems. ""Well, the computer says... "" or, ""the system won't allow me to do this..."" are the phrases we hear all too frequently from customer service personnel informing us that our expectations should be diminishing greatly with every passing second.Thankfully for me, Sharifar walked over as soon as the staff member initially assisting me began to struggle with my conflicting tickets. Seeing her colleague stumbling to figure out next steps, Sharifa calmly walked over and offered to help her colleague decipher the situation. Quickly recognizing the nuance the scenario required, Sharifa respectfully dispatched her colleague to take care of another customer who had an easier problem to solve. Â Sharifa then proceeded to dissect my situation in logical fashion -- cross-referencing my receipts against SeaWorld's ticketing system and taking the necessary steps to overcome the stubborn computer blocks standing in the way a solution. This may sound like a non-event. Â But anyone who has been caught in a Kafkaesque situation where computers and binary protocols seem to strip all the humanity and commonsense from an encounter will appreciate what I'm describing. In Sharifa's hands, the situation was resolved in just a few short minutes and my daughter and I were free to enjoy our special day as planned. In lesser hands, our day would have been far less enjoyable or perhaps completely scuttled.Thanks, Sharifa! I'm sure your smart, compassionate professionalism will take you many places; and along the way I hope you get a chance to mentor as many people as possible."
866,5/24/2014,4,"With the addition of the new interactive exhibits, I think SeaWorld has taken another step in helping kids to better learn and understand about sea life. Â And found a way to make it fun.After not visiting since I was a kid maybe 20+ years ago, I was excited to go as an adult for the first time. Â Sad because I knew I wouldn't see cool human/whale interactions anymore (will we ever again?! Â I hope so...) but looking forward to seeing what else was on offer.From fun interactive hands-on exhibits with manta rays, sharks, flesh scrubbing minnows (maybe the coolest thing ever, and totally not what they are actually called) and starfish, to big sharks swimming around you in the almost 360 degree underwater exhibits. This place has so much cool stuff to see.Though the dolphin show was a bit lame and the human performances only stood to extend what would otherwise be a very short and underwhelming dolphin show experience, I still enjoyed the attempt and who doesn't love to see dolphins!? Â They do seem to enjoy themselves.The whale show felt much the same, only more sad. Â Trainers just standing around triumphantly extending their arms like they had just landed a triple back flip twisty roundhouse alley-opp while blindfolded, while whales swim around and splash water out of their pool/tank. Â It was sad, and I miss the shows of old, and again, hope for them to go back to it one day.If I were a kid, would I care? Â No! Â I would be thrilled to see live Orcas swimming and jumping. Â What a cool thing to see and experience. Â Much as it was for me all those years ago.This is a special place and for the most part I think all of the people we encountered seemed to really love talking about and sharing their thoughts and knowledge about all of the species at the park. Â I would totally recommend coming for the day and seeing all there is on offer. Â Don't forget to see the otters and penguins. Â They may just be the most fun/pleasing sights you'll see all day."
867,6/29/2016,4,"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to SeaWorld. Of course it is crowded and overpriced, but you should know that going in. We only stayed for a few hours and didn't go on any rides, but I liked seeing the fish and the animals there. The dolphin and otter shows were pretty good, and of course, we watched the killer whales. In the whale stadium, they have warning signs about getting wet in the splash zone. Of course, we ignored these warnings (how wet can you get?) and paid the price. We were in row 5, and of course, we got totally soaked (4 or 5 times in a row) by the killer whale and its huge tail. Â Although we were only here for the morning and early afternoon, we felt that we got our money's worth. I am glad that they have changed some of their practices (especially with the whales)."
868,7/17/2016,3,"Disappointing. I had been to SeaWorld in 2005, as a 12 year old, and can still remember the entire orca show. Returning to San Diego as a 23 year old, I was excited to see another amazing show. I knew that trainers could no longer go in the water with the whales but assumed that SeaWorld would compensate for this by doing something else amazing - perhaps being more educational or thinking of some other creative stunt. But wow, this show was boring. Without the trainers in the water it seems like the only thing the whales are able to do is splash the audience, spin, and swim around the pool. Every act was also totally out of sync.To be fair, I realize it's easier to impress a 12 year old than a 23 year old. So, I went back and watched our family tapes, to make sure I hadn't imagined an awesome show back in 2005. But the tapes reveled a great show. Today, this place is much too expensive for what it offers."
869,1/8/2017,3,Awful service today considering the fact it was the last show for the orcas. It wasn't handled well. A worker name Trinity should probably be trained more on customer service. Just because you have a title doesn't mean you know hospitality. Our first visit at SeaWorld was excellent but the second time we were treated awful. I definitely wouldn't recommend going to this place anymore.
870,8/16/2018,4,"My first time coming here and I enjoyed it. The shows were great and it was a weekday so it wasn't crowded. But your tickets online!! It's almost double at the park. Even though we didn't have time to go on rides I thought it was cool that the park had that option so, if you get bored with animals then voila! Go on a ride."
871,7/14/2014,4,"This is not the SeaWorld you knew as a kid!To be fair, it's not mine either: I grew up going to the one in San Antonio.In any case, it's still a magical place- the shows seem more interactive and now include more performers with skills in acrobatics and cirque tricks. They are spaced out throughout the day so it's not too hard to get to them. Signage suggests arriving early for best seating but even waiting until just prior to showtime, we were able to get good seats for all the shows we attended.There are more rides now, too- the Manta is the only roller-coaster option but the line is fast. Two water rides are available, with lengthy lines. Other SW locations include admission to their Aquatica waterpark with their standard SW admission but here they do not appear to even be at the same location, which is a bummer.Animal exhibits and enclosures are well maintained and manned by knowledgeable staff- we managed to meet a sloth, feed manta rays and sealions, and see an educational presentation on the dolphins at Dolphin Point, without any pre-planning. Penguin, aquarium, and shark buildings are all easily organized and have clear signage- you can spend as little or as much time as you like in there.Lastly, I didn't eat here, but the CafÃ© 64 offers beer which made the ride lines a little more bearable- pricing for souvenirs, food, and beverage were all comparable to elsewhere: $10 turkey legs, $10 beer samplers, $13 sunglasses, $5 to feed the animals, etc.**For smaller crowds and best pricing, purchase your tickets online for the weekday-only pass (and go on a weekday)- total comes to $50/person instead of $80. Parking is a flat $15 unless you opt for ""up close"", which didn't seem worth it when arriving at 10AM.**"
872,5/19/2017,1,"Don't waste your money going there if you want to see the marine life: adjust your expectations, it's an attraction place with dumb rides and cheap toys; which I would have been ok paying $30 pp for, not for the price they are charging, what a disappointing experience, I felt ripped off, and I wished I had checked more reviews before we went"
873,6/29/2017,5,Had an Amazing time! They have an Elmo's world for the kids to run around and play also get wet with little fountains shooting up water from the floor. I loved how educational it is. The kids get to learn and its hands on. The Dolphins show was my least favorite kind of boring we left early! Now the shamoo show was amazing! They splash the crowd and swim around and do flips and they are so beautiful. We went on some rides ship wreck rapid will most likely get you 100% soaked! It's really fun just don't go on late in the afternoon because it starts to get really cold if you don't bring extra clothes. Food is pricey so if you are on a budget eat before you go. We went to Costco and every one ate and got full for very cheap and we didn't have to snack much at seaworld. We went on a Sunday and to our surprise the lines were not very long for any rides. You get to touch dolphins and stingrays. I had a very very good time. Bring lots of sunscreen and a hat and comfy shoes. I loved the shark aquarium! You can tell the trainers love the animals
874,9/29/2016,3,"My day at SeaWorld did not start out great. Â The entry fee of the park is $80 per person if you didn't pre-order online. Â By the time we realized it (at the ticketing counter) we have already paid for parking so we pretty much have to get the tickets. Â What's worse is when we realized we could have preordered tickets for a lot less so remember to do that.The lines for food were long and the food end up being very greasy. Â I know I shouldn't expect too much from a theme park but I have definitely had better in other parks.We went to a lot of the shows. Â My expectations wasn't too high to begin with but I was still somewhat disappointed. Â I didn't really get to see a lot of animals and many of the shows just end up being actors dancing around on a wet floor.I had even less expectations on the rides, but I was thoroughly impressed by them. Â Both of the roller coasters were really fun and novel, and because of that we actually walked out of the park pretty satisfied."
875,6/2/2017,5,I love dolphins and killer whales! They have good shows here. The sea lion show was so cute to watch along with other animals performing. Got a seating to watch the killer whale show. Had fun~
876,9/11/2016,4,"Seaworld is a great place to come with a family with kids but I wish it had a few more exciting things for adults. Never the less it's always nice seeing all the sweet animals here. We saw a lot of dolphins, turtles, SHARKS! and a polar bear and a baby beluga whale. Didn't give it its full 5 starts just because the food is pretty mediocre. My boyfriend and I bought the all day bracelet. The chicken was pretty cold... The staff was amazing! Everyone I encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. I have the pass so I'll def be back to enjoy the sight of these cute animals:)"
877,1/17/2018,5,I love SeaWorld! Even when blackfish came out I was still behind SeaWorld. They do so much good that's not mentioned on the news! All you see is the bad! If you go there for a day you will see how much they educate and give back to the ocean!
878,1/2/2018,5,"We live here and go to seaworld at least a few times a year. My 3 year old and 1 year old love it and so do I. It's way more fun than the zoo, because not only are there animals, but there are also rides and a much more elaborate play area for kids. There is an entire toddler area with toddler sized rides and a play structure and other areas where your kids can just run around freely. It's also never as busy as the zoo, especially if you go during the week. I just wish they had a family pass like the zoo does and that they didn't charge for parking if you are a local. If they could do these two things they would probably get a lot more local visitors and increase their revenue. Oh and they also have some great food spots!"
879,5/10/2018,1,Overpriced and feels very outdated....seems like they don't see a future to invest in. Â I would go to the zoo instead--cheaper and a lot less cheesy.
880,9/10/2016,5,We love this place there is something here for every age and for mama. Â They have at least 20 different kinds of beer on tap as you wander the grounds and plenty of free play areas for a the littles = everyone's happy happy
881,5/29/2014,5,"What a day of fun!I came with my family since we were at the Bahia for a wedding and figured it had been years since our last visit. Bought tickets around noon and made our way over. We had an awesome time watching the Orcas, Seals and Dolphins. The highlights for me were the rollarcoasters, Manta and Atlantis. Atlantis pretty much blew my mind, what an awesome ride!I would highly recommend Seaworld to everyone. And yes, I know they are ""controversial"" since they keep animals in captivity for the entertainment value of the likes of me, but they also do a world of good and have made huge breakthroughs in studying aquatic life. Anyway, not trying to get political, bottom line, I had a great time at Seaworld and hope that I will be able to take my kids there too."
882,6/3/2016,5,SeaWorld is just terrific. Even my 9 month old daughter had fun seeing all the animals up close. The food isn't as overpriced as the San Diego Zoo either which makes it nice if you're going with a large family. The exhibits are planned and designed very well. They also have some amusement rides which I found a great feature.The shows don't allow you to bring your stroller in so consider taking a bicycle lock if you have an expensive stroller.
883,12/29/2017,5,Thank you Sea World for your Waves of Honor program! You really make visiting your park affordable for military members and their families!
884,4/3/2014,4,The animals seem happy... I'm not really sure what to say. Â The food prices are on the high to reasonably high. Â You'll get splashed if it says you will. Â Turkey legs run about $10. Â They have an eat all day for $30 bucks. Â Ps: Teachers are free! Horrraaaay.
885,5/8/2016,5,"The most amazing Birthday Â experience ever ! My boyfriend bought me the Beluga Encounter program as one of my birthday gifts and I loved every single minute ! I got to meet beluga Fernand, and I completely fell I. Love with him. Â the experience was worth it and I definitely recommend it!"
886,12/26/2017,5,"You have to see Oh Wondrous Night, The Story of the Birth of Jesus! Absolutely amazing!!!!"
887,8/25/2012,4,"Honestly, I wasn't all that pumped to go to Sea World. I went with some friends that were alot more into than I was. All that said, I really, really enjoyed my day here! It's a much more laid back vibe to this place as opposed to most amusement parks I've been to.This place is much more about the shows than the rides. I caught all the shows with the exception of the Sesame Street show (I'm good, thanks), and I was pleasantly suprised at how enjoyable they were! The Shamu show was great, but that Sea Lion show was really fun! I thought the Blue Horizons show was just okay. The dolphins were cool, but the Cirque-like elements of the show was long winded and annoying.There aren't too many rides, but most of the ones there are fun. Journey to Atlantis and the Manta Coaster really stand out in my mind. Plus they have those chill ""rides"" like the Tower Ride and the Skyride. Getting to pet the Rays and touch the starfish are cool as always. I just loved checking out all the animals in the aquariums and etc.! Very freaking cool!I just sucked it up and paid the 73.00 admission and spent a little over 7 hours in the park and felt like I got my moneys worth. Made for a fun and memorable day.4.5 stars"
888,10/1/2017,1,"We have been season pass customers for the last few years and have always loved sea world. We went today and renewed our season passes and decided to do the Dine with the Orcas experience for the first time. The food and experience were great but the service was terrible. Our waitress dropped a tray of glasses on the ground and table shattering every one of them leaving my fiancÃ© and 2 year old daughter literally covered in glass. All over their legs, clothes and hair. So bad that a lady behind us was helping get it out of her hair. The waitress did apologize and get us new drinks but offered no compensation at all and didn't come back to the table once after the incident so we just left. More training is defiantly needed with the staff"
889,1/6/2018,3,"The dolphin and orca shows were fantastic. We got soaking wet and cold in one of them, but it was an unique and awesome experience. The rest of the park felt small and rundown compared to what we remembered (we were here more than 10 years ago). It was the coolest of the San Diego destinations and we couldn't finish all parts of it in one day. It now resembles more of a county fair than a theme park and we were bored by sundown. Don't trust the posted ride times. Everything was a 5-min wait but turned into 15-30 min wait."
890,2/10/2018,4,"An excellent 'Must Go' experience. The staff and trainers are people who are the apex of animal care giving. The food and snack are convenient and essential, I love the stingray / mantaray petting section."
891,3/13/2016,3,"Oh Seaworld, I miss the charm of my memories being here as a child. The dolphin show was closed, the Shamu show has been so watered down and almost every food place was closed. (Maybe because it was on a Sunday?) I give them props for all the conservation efforts they have been making but I feel that the spark of excitement is gone. So sad. We got free tickets for a friend to see the Lunar New Year celebrations that was supposed to be happening however, we never saw or heard anything. Bummer. So we needed up walking around and checking out the shows, rode Mantas which was the shortest ride line ever! Went through the shark encounter, braved the smell of the penguin exhibit and laughed at a poor penguin fail on trying to hop up onto land, got to finally touch a dolphin at the dolphin cove area. I think we missed the otters.I did love seeing the giant sea turtles! So pretty and majestic creatures. Overall, I enjoyed the company o went with and learning out the animals of the sea. However it's not a park I can see myself staying there all day for or wanting to go back more than once a year."
892,12/22/2017,5,"SeaWorld San Diego is a great park. It's never overly crowded, the shows are interesting and informative, all-in-all my family always has a great time. This review is more for their all-day dining deal. We recently utilized this option, and while it is a good deal, I didn't feel like all the rules were properly explained before purchasing. 1. I was under the impression that I could walk into one of the participating restaurants and pick up a snack if I was a little hungry, but this seemed not to be the case as you're meant to purchase full meals each time. When I asked for one piece of a meal they looked at me like I was crazy. 2. We have two people with a gluten allergy in our family and this made it much more complicated. The kids meals had basically no gluten free options at most restaurants and they weren't willing/able to make substitutions which led to a lot of pouty faces. If you have a gluten allergy don't go to pineapple Pete's and expect anything other than a salad. In the end we saved some money and ate more than we probably would've otherwise, but just know it's not as freeform as they make it sound when you buy the tickets. At least, that was my interpretation."
893,6/13/2016,5,"Ever since I was little, I always wanted to be a mermaid. I loved Dolphins and I never was a Disney Fan. I loved Seaworld more than Disney. I honestly can't stand that one documentary ruined everything for everyone at Seaworld. It is a DOCUMENTARY, It doesn't portray the whole picture. I have a degree in Psychology and one of the trainers was my teacher for a class in college. She was candid and real about the controversy. Some of these animals would not survive as long as they're surviving at Seaworld. I will always be a strong & avid supporter for Seaworld. Â Anwyays, I LOVE coming here. This place makes me happy. I love the animals, I love the rides and everything about this location. I recently visited the Orlando location and I like the San Diego one better. However, I do like that the Orlando has an interactive Dolphin experience for pretty cheap. We spent over 40 mins with Dolphins, played with them and even learned some pretty cool tricks for only $15. I love SEAWORLD. Take the kids & entire family. So sad to see how empty the parks are now. I would be so sad if they shut down. Lets keep them open!"
894,5/29/2014,4,"We came in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Seaworld and it was SO MUCH FUN! When you come in, you see this amazing and colorful structure that whisks you to an underwater world, where you can interact with a lot of the fish and the sealife (I got my hands cleaned on by cute little sucker cleaner fish). The animals seemed really well taken cared of and my baby sister and cousin had a whole bunch of fun. For me, the highlight of my day was seeing the baby killer whale perform in the shamu show- it was so cute that I wanted to just take it home haha (just kidding~ I don't have enough fish to feed it!)One word of the wise: beware the seagulls! They are quite vicious when it comes to stealing food. Also, I went on the behind-the-scenes tour and I don't know- after the animal spotlight tour, this one felt lacking. I expected a lot more interaction and felt disappointed! Another blah thing was how the salad that I got basically consisted of a whole bunch of fruit, a pinch of salad, and a bit of feta cheese on a plate. That's it.All and all, it was a fun day. I would definitely come again."
895,8/18/2016,4,We have season passes and love coming here. The Arctic and penguin buildings are great! The grounds are usually always clean and the staff welcoming.
896,1/1/2017,5,"Had a great time today at SeaWorld San Diego. I appreciate the new direction the park is heading and was impressed by the high level of hospitality and service throughout the holiday outing at the park. Specifically, Andrea at Shipwreck Cafe was very accommodating and helpful in ensuring our meal was perfect. Keep it up, guys!"
897,10/9/2016,4,Should not take 25 minutes before guys put you quesadilla on to cook (1 star). Guy with beard who took my order had to step in and get all the orders on track. People who there after me started getting their orders before they started mine. Two other employees seemed not to have a clue about the operation.One really good thing about today is the candy station (5stars) you can see them (not hidden like Legoland last night) and they have them everywhere!
898,2/16/2014,3,"""My friends kept telling not to go bc of some kind of documentary called BLACKFISH but, I haven't been there in 20 years so I just wanted to go see how much has changed & have fun in San Diego...""TICKETS : Regular $84, from Cal State L.A. $60 for studentsDRINKS: minimum $8.99 for a souvenir bottle and refills are $0.99PARKING: Was a BITCH! $20 close-up parking or $15 regular parkingTURTLE REEF: Really cool...PENGUIN TURF: Really cute...SHAMU SHOW: Trainers did not get in the water at all, the fishes were spinning, jumping & splashing people near the front...( I Noticed that the biggest SHAMU fin wasn't as straight as the others, it was bent-shaped or collapsed) SO SAD :(DOLPHIN SHOW: Trainers were in the water, standing & riding on the dolphins, dolphins splashed water at people near the front. Â Surprisingly there was a little cirque de soleil-like act too (BIRD THEME)...you don't say?!SEA LION & OTTER SHOW: Very entertaining & funny, the sea lions did some dancing, acting & tricks... OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Would probably not be back unless necessary, overall experience was fun but, something fishy surely goes on around there...also it was quite similar to the Aquarium of the Pacific. Â The Journey to Atlantis ride was closed, very dissapointing but, then again questioning the reason for it being closed as well...""I will not be back, back, back!"""
899,9/6/2016,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE SEAWORLD!!!!I have been many times and can't get enough of this place. I have enjoyed taking each of my three children and watching them experience the joy of Sea World for the first time. It is such a happy and peaceful place. The dolphin show is so cute and the Shamu show is amazing. Pets Rule is adorable. The animals are clean and look healthy. I know some will complain about the captivity of the animals. But I think they fail to see the good that Sea World does. I will continue to support SEA WORLD!"
900,3/9/2015,3,"Fishes,rides, and funnel cake what more could you ask for from such a cool place!! Â sea world offers plenty to do manly shows and duh looking at all the fishes, sea lions Ect!! Something really fun todo and very different is feeding the stingrays it's really unique an has you wanting to feed them all day! The food at the park is great Rides are cool but limited Shows if you seen them once then you don't have to see them againWhy I don't give sea world 4 stars or 5 is that the park doesn't draw you back, nothing really changes when you go an visit again so it's really just one of those parks you go to every blue moon. An of course the killer whale show ain't the same an it sadness me but we all know why it had to be changed. I really hope that'd they'd but some changes into the park an keep it updated so it's a new experience every visit!"
901,10/12/2016,4,"I just bought an annual pass from Costco after I realized that I hadn't been to SeaWorld since I was 10. I have absolutely enjoyed my two recent visits so far! Most recent being Monday 10/11! I went on Manta twice, Journey to Atlantis once, and watched the Dolphins show! I found that show to be the best out of all that I have seen! I like the Orca show but Dolphins seem a bit more pleasant. Anyway, lines never get too long and I really enjoyed my first visit was well! They are doing treat stations around the park during this month to celebrate Halloween. Can never get too old to trick or treat! :)"
902,12/31/2013,1,"Overpriced passes, overpriced and greasy food. Â Parking is terrible. Â The trainers don't go in the water like they used to so the orca show is boring and not worth the trip. Â Even kids find it depressing to watch the massive animals in the small tanks. Â Tour guides are not knowledgeable. Â It's much better to visit state parks where kids can see dolphins, whales and other animals in their natural habitat."
903,5/25/2014,5,"Love this place. Â Love the orcas. Love the dolphins. Â Love the sea lions. Our family highlights:Dining with Shamu!!!!!!!Feeding sea lions and sealsFeeding the raysClyde and Seymore night time showManta rideShipwreck RapidsNibbly fish in the front touch tanksIt's been awhile since we had been here and our one big observation is that the shows have gotten incredibly sappy. Dolphin show used to be so much fun with the fake tourist family from Arizona. Now it's some sort of hard to follow corny dream sequence with odd dancers/divers. Â Also what's with the fountains around the Shamu show tank - if a 9,000 pound whale jumping and splashing isn't exciting to you then a fountain isn't going to get you there. I found them to be distracting from the animals. Small criticisms though because we love this place, had a great time and left with wonderful memories. Â Would go over and over if we lived closer. Â Special call out to Orca trainer Michelle who was wonderful and really made our day special."
904,6/16/2017,4,"I had not visited Sea World San Diego in 30 years. Yesterday I took my family and we had a great time. This is definitely an experience that has to be done at least once. Both my wife and and my 10 year old son had a great time. A few things that I took away from the visit that I want to share with future goers are. Parking: Go early. The park opens at 10a. I suggest being there at that time. The cheapest parking is $17 up to $35. Getting there early will allow you to pay for the cheaper parking and still be much closer.Outside food: The park does a bag check at the entrance to keep the park safe and free from outside food or drink. We had so much stuff in our bag that we were able to sneak a couple of bananas and some crackers into the park under some other items. The park does have an outside the park picnic area if you wanna take a cooler with food and drinks in it for the little ones. Just make sure to get your hand stamped. Inside the park food can be costly. Tip!: Buy a one day souvenir cup for $12.99. You can refill the whole day at any drink station in the park. We had 3 in our party no one ever went thirsty for the whole day and we got a cool souvenir. Rides: if you are a thrill ride kind of person, Sea World does have some exciting rides for everyone. Ride early as the lines get longer as the day goes on. Go M-T for a better experience. There is a kids area with games and rides for the little ones. Also, there are a couple of roller coaster type rides, a log ride, white water rafting ride and a sky tram all included with admission. If you are a bigger person like me (6'1 365lbs) rides can be challenging due to the seat size. I was able to ride the white water rafting, sky tram, log ride and the simulated helicopter ride in Antarctica. Never tried the the Manta Coaster because of the line but looked like it would have been tight. Shows: Get to them 15 min early minimum. The seats fill fast.All of the shows are worth seeing at least once. They have been completely revamped and are very educational but still allow for some fun as the animals splash the visitors in up close seating. These shows are completely different from when I was a kid but safer for the animals and trainers. Â Overall my family had a great time! We were in the park from 10:30a-4:30p and could have easily spent the rest of the day seeing and doing things we skipped. This is a ""don't miss"" if you are in the San Diego area. I hope this helps you decide on your families next get away."
905,7/31/2017,5,"In my opinion this is a great family theme park. Yes, it is packed but what theme park isn't? I personally enjoyed the ""Orca"" and ""dolphin"" shows. My daughter enjoyed the rides and I feel that Sea Word did a great job providing a lot of information about the animals as well as information on how to donate to different groups that assist with each species of animal. Overall it was great! My sister is an annual pass holder which already includes parking and she got a bit of a discount at each shop/food cart. Can't wait to be back next year!"
906,1/2/2015,5,"Love this park! Â I went to the park on Tuesday,12/30 at 7pm just to see the Christmas Shamu show before it ends. I love how the church choir came out & sang at the end. So festive!!!I had time to see Â baby Shamu born only 4 weeks ago. Â Interesting to see theses whales & how staff is attentive of its every move.I love how they the staff said Merry Christmas to me & how friendly they were.I would LOVE to commend Sea World for not being ""politically correct"" Â and for saying ""Merry Christmas"". Â This is what America is about & if others want to believe and say another holiday greeting, I'm fine w/ that but I don't have to stop saying what I grew up to know & believe & that is Christmas!! Â Thank you Sea World for a festive Shamu show. Â I'll be back for Lunar New Year!"
907,10/30/2016,3,"It was an ok experience for us. Went to all the shows. Seal and Dolphin shows were great. We saw two shows at shamu stadium, first one was of killer whales at 430 and it was ok. We went to the closing show again at 7 and it was basically the same 430 show with some lights and music added. If you don't have time, only go for the closing shamu show and spend time at other rides. We couldn't cover the sky ride and few other rides.We got an all day dining pass and it saved a lot of money, haven't spent an extra dollar on food. You get like 5 restaurants to go to and can every hour. The food was subpar. Smoke house's food was not good. Only place I liked was the cafe 64 and their burger and unfortunately its closing soon. Kids can have fun during halloween coz of the free trick or treat candies everywhere. We reached at around 11 and could have covered few more rides if we got there by 10am."
908,2/8/2014,2,"We are huge animal fans in our house. We've done pretty much everything from swimming with dolphins in Hawaii to feeding the giraffes and rhinos over at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Our recent visit to Sea world was the first time our money spent didn't come close to the value of the other experiences.It hits you right at the door. $15 for parking. That is phenomenally overpriced. Next, the gate tickets are $84 for a day. That's almost as terrible as what Disneyland charges. Unless you are buying a one-year pass to take your kids often, this admission is a rip-off. The concessions are typical amusement park fare. The food is overcooked, overpriced, and always leaves you hungry for more. On our trip, the Cirq show was off for the season and several aquariums were closed. From an adult perspective, I found the shows to be lacking any sort of ""wow"" factor. They were mostly music and people in crayon box wetsuits dancing. Not my cup of tea.We may go back to do the Breakfast with Shamu deal, because at least the menu looked decent for that. But right now our hopes aren't too high."
909,7/9/2018,5,It was a nice atmosphere my family did had a great time although watching the dolphins without shades it was super hot
910,4/27/2016,5,"Sea world is a lot of fun, especially if you have your year pass you also get a cool discount off food drinks snacks and anything from the stores. They kid rides and the manta ride. You can feed the sea lions touch the star fishes and feed the sting rays. They also have those cool little fishes in the front that eat your dead skin off your hands. I love all the shows my daughter loved the dog show :)"
911,8/27/2016,3,"SeaWorld is one of the few things that everyone mentions when I told them I was visiting San Diego. And when they mention it, they either talk about the number of little kids or Shamu (both positively and negatively), and those seem like the best ways to sum up SeaWorld.There are a ton of kids running around, and I guess it is a fun place for little kids -- there are cool animals, typical amusement park type foods, and even some amusement rides. There are all types of aquatic animals here. From sharks to dolphins to whales to polar bears and all types of fish. The shows are entertaining, and if you could only watch one, I would recommend the Dolphin Days one; they're clearly the smartest animals and it's very exciting. Obviously, the controversy around SeaWorld has been how they treat their animals. I can't speak for them since I'm not on the inside, but it is a little difficult to watch the dolphins and the whales sort of just being our entertainment.In general, deciding to visit SeaWorld is up to you, whether you're a super animal activist or not, I think it is important to understand that animals aren't meant to be contained like this. However, they do claim to keep them in good environments and to treat them with respect, so all we can do is hope they're keeping to their word. I enjoyed my time, but I probably wouldn't go back until I have my own kids."
912,11/12/2015,1,"As I have seen Blackfish, I have been anti-SeaWorld since I've seen it. However we had free tickets and I'm new to San Diego so figured I should go just to go. It wasn't very crowded which was nice. The best part of the entire day was riding the Manta roller coaster and taking the skybuckets at sunset. Now on to the negatives....we saw an octopus (pretty large one at that) in a TINY tank. Not only that, but his tank was trashed and there was a broken water filter floating in his tank. We also saw a turtle in a fairly small tank. They had fed him lettuce but he couldn't get to it because it was wedged between a rock and the glass tank window. All in all, it made me realize how sad some of these animals have it. Rescued or not, they deserve to be treated better. And I didn't find myself really learning anything - I was actually quite bored.I would never buy a ticket for $89 and I will never go back."
913,1/25/2016,5,"SeaWorld San Diego is great. It is well organized, the shows are great, the interactions are amazing and the summer camps are excellent. We found it very educational and enjoyable. If you are in San Diego it is an attraction not to be missed"
914,11/7/2017,4,"My husband and I went here on Monday for a staycation. We really enjoyed our time there watching the shows, admiring the beautiful animals in their aquariums, and going on the sky ride (lift type thing overlooking mission bay) which was romantic for us. This place is fun for both adults as well as those who want to bring families (we saw many many families). My only complaint is that 2 rides were down while we were there :("
915,1/3/2016,5,"Recently had a great experience at Sea World and sent them this email ...I hope this email gets to someone in leadership and all of those I mention below. My family (wife, children and grandchildren), and I all spent Black Friday at SeaWorld, San Diego. We are recent two year season pass owners, and wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving there together as well as take advantage of all your holiday decorations and events. What I want to say is this ... To me SeaWorld has been a wonderful place to visit over the past 35 years I have lived in SoCal. Great animals to see and learn about. I am so sorry there are uneducated people that seem to look for a cause to fight to make themselves feel important at the expense of others and these amazing creatures. Please don't give up! Anyway, it was great to see that you served turkey that day as well since we all missed Thanksgiving dinner together the day before! I also love that you acknowledge Christmas outwardly and without hesitation to celebrate! Your Santa was absolutely amazing with my grandkids! He had a great personality and took interest in each child. BTW, the pager thing was a terrific idea. Rather than sitting on line, we were able to go next door, eat our meal and be back just in time for our turn with Santa! Perfect! Also, we met up with your Elves more than once along our days journey and they were all nothing less than outstanding! Again spent quality time engaging with the kids and made them smile from ear to ear. And they loved the dance party that evening! Everywhere we went, your team was joyful and happy to serve. The Sesame Street theater was fun for all and just the right amount of time to hold the kids attention! I am making a big deal of all of this because unfortunately all to often you don't get near this interaction elsewhere, thus felt compelled to take the time and let you know. PLEASE pass on our gratitude to everyone and thank you for what you all do for us, and the animals!! I can't wait to spend another holiday there with my family!"
916,9/20/2017,3,"Very entertaining.... liked it so much more than the zoo... there are tons of areas for the little ones. Everything is educational, cool interactive areas, staff is helpful. if you have any questions, just ask any of the staff sitting around the display and they will do a great job of going into detail with anything you would want to know about any specific animal. Most of the staff really seem to like what they do so they are energetic which in turn gets you and the little ones excited to learn new things. Â  TONS of different animals to see, interactive displays, petting pools. Had to come as i had never been before, and this is the last year with the orcas i believe...all in all i really liked this place abd would definitely come back again."
917,4/21/2018,2,"I have been waiting at the ticket counter for about 30 minutes after standing in line for another 30 minutes because they can't figure out how to print hard membership cards. Keilani Â was amazing. She was polite and explained the situation. She spoke to the manager who sent us to another cashier Marrissa . That's when things got worse. Marissa Â had a bad attitude, was very rude and tried to say that Keilani didn't know what she was doing. I'm so ready to just go home and never come back. What makes this even worse is that today is my daughter's birthday. They did eventually comp us dinner( that I can't eat because I'm dieting). The two stars is for the waiting and the poor customer service given by the other cashier. Thanks Arnold (manager) for trying to turn this day around for us."
918,6/28/2014,4,"We came here two days during our week long stay at SoCal. The weather is nice here. Not too cold and not too hot. Â Rides are ok but we didn't do a lot of the rides since our kids are small. The only rides we took were in Sesame St. Land and the skyride to nowhere. You literally rode out to the ocean and back. The animal displays and shows were good. We liked Shamu, the dolphin, seal and pets shows. Cirque de le mer reminds me of Cirque du Soliel it was overly long and the clowns creeped the kids out. The Live Madagascar show was great too!The simulated Arctic wild ride was also neat. Minus one star for the clerk at Turtle Cove who didn't let me check the box to see whether it was the same tchotchke as the one I picked out. She said, ""it's the same."" Â Well, it wasn't. I found out after I got back to the hotel thus necessitating my second trip for an exchange. The clerk on duty happily exchanged the tchotchke for me. They even arranged to let me do package pick up instead of carrying it around all day. Park mgmt, package pick up was hard to find because there was no area labelled thusly. I asked the staff person at the petting pond where it was and she had no idea. I go to customer service and they tell me to pick it up at ""rentals."" Â To save everyone time, change your signage!One tip, go early because you don't have to wait for rides or shows. Â Everyone shows up after lunch so there's a wait!"
919,6/22/2017,2,"Such mixed feelings in this review....sea world left me feeling confused!!my family and i visited sea world on monday june 19th, the place was empty! Â i found this to be nice but also a little sad. Â the kids rode the rides and the longest wait was 10 minutes. finding a seat at any show was never a problem and the line to eat at the ship wreck cafe was, none! Â this made for a great day for us but it also made me feel sea world is slacking just a bit on the entertainment factor for excitement!! Â a huge disappointment was the illumi-night show. this was our last show of the night and it is was ridiculous!! the backdrop was covering an old stage area, the description in sea worlds map of this shows details were very misleading and this show needs to be re-thought if not just removed from the line up.the cirque show on the other hand was amazing!!! Â it is twenty minutes of non stop fun and excitement and feels like a mini version of a vegas show. we enjoyed sea lions live and the host biff was the star of the show!! most of the concession stands were closed which im sure is due to attendance, which again left me feeling a bit sad and seemed a bit depressing at times! Â hope sea world can survive. Â it has always been a family favorite and the location on the beautiful blue ocean and the bayside sky ride has always been wonderful."
920,8/30/2017,5,"They have changed SeaWorld a lot since Blackfish came out... There are still 4 main shows, the dolphin show, the shamu show, the pet show, and the sea lion show. Â My favorite are the pet show and the sea lion show, and those were the only two we got to see this time around. Â We went on a Friday and got there in the morning when it opened. Â There was not too many people there which was nice because it wasn't too crowded. Â The description on the Shamu show and the Dolphin show made it seem like they were changed to be more educational, so we didn't go because I think our 2 year old was too young for it. Â She loved the pet show and the sea lion show though! Â She kept saying ""more!"" Â We also went by and did the rides in Sesame Street Bay of Play. Â She loved them so much she went on most of them twice. Â Some of them even let us stay on the ride after it was over to ride it again since there were so little people there. Â The front of the amusement park was also changed, there is a lot of small pools with things you can pet, like sharks, stingrays, etc. We also stopped by to see the penguins, the sharks, the aquarium, the dolphins, and some other animals. Â I think they did a good job in the changes they made. Â This place will obviously always hold a special place in my heart since we got engaged here, so hopefully SeaWorld is here to stay indefinitely :)"
921,5/30/2017,1,"Rating due website and phone customer service.Tried since Jan to get the fun card and passes. After having logged in and added items to cart...required to put in password again. Put in Â same password several times and it wouldn't work. Tried for months and Â it wouldn't workSince phonelines close at four, I was never able to talk to them. Now I have to wait until next year. Apparently there were many issues with the online purchasing, yet they didn't fix it and didn't extended the deadline. That's horrible. Then they tried to give me the runaround and have me a call a number where no help could really be given. Doesn't seem like they really want to help anybody. My money is better spent another park. No thank you"
922,6/25/2016,5,Best time! All ages enjoy. Not terribly long lines during spring break. It rained for a bit but we were on the Gondola ride so it was actually pretty with the bay misty. Get the 2 day pass cause we felt rushed to see it all and we were there 11hours. Beers and drinks are decent price. Get the refillable pop. Food is best at restaurants and better portions. Portions outdoors are smaller than think. Animals are loved and well taken care of. My daughters asked lots of questions and got honest educated answers. I was impressed. The orca dinner is great and personal. My girls loved it for the finale bday present. Thanks seaworld. See u soon
923,2/14/2016,3,"Expensive, and mostly closed in mid-January. Awful layout, lots of walking in the wrong direction required, map and signs are not very helpful. Hard to see anymals outside of short shows. Â The schedule changes daily, making it hard to plan. Deceptive tickets - hard to figure out how many days admission is included, parking is extra.Still, beautiful views of the Bay, nice playground for little kids. Good food, even if expensive. Smiley, although clueless, staff. Half the park is filled with arcade games - boring, and an additional upsell."
924,5/7/2016,4,"I recently visited SeaWorld on a Wednesday. As an ocean-lover, I enjoyed being able to see so much marine life in one place, as I save up for a possible future trip to the Caribbean where I will actually be able to snorkel. I hadn't been to the park in over twenty years, but I was still excited about my recent day there. I especially enjoyed the touch tanks and the dolphin shows. I also think it's great that the park planning committee added the Atlantis ride and the Manta rollercoaster. Â Above all, the tranquility of gliding across the bay on Bayside Skyride was the highlight of my day. Â Upon entry to SeaWorld, Staff were very friendly and parking was a simple and easy process for me. Â However, I do believe that prices for items like small bottles of water and popcorn could be reduced. Â On that note, SeaWorld does not forbid guests from entering the park with their own fruit and snacks. Â This is awesome for those interested in having a great time while also remaining financially responsible. Â At the end of my visit, I was asked to complete a survey about my experience. The survey questions were thorough and well-constructed. This shows that SeaWorld is committed to customer service excellence and actually cares enough to hear what constituents/guests have to say.I really enjoyed my fun and educational experience at SeaWorld."
925,5/23/2017,1,I think Seaworld lost it['s charm over the years. I was there for springbreak with my kids and they were more excited about kids play area then seeing animals. We watched dolphin and pet show. Visited all the exhibits . I am surely not coming back to this place. There are more exciting places to visit and enjoy then Seaworld.
926,7/1/2017,5,Fun park with good rides and great shows. Just be careful with the sun and heat exhaustion. The sun can be unrelenting and their shows do not have shade.
927,7/19/2017,1,Customer service is horrible....as long as you spend money and don't bother anyone they are okay.
928,11/17/2017,5,Amazing ride journey to Atlantis we came on a Friday and we were the only ones in line. I highly recommend this ride!
929,10/14/2016,5,Best time ever thank you so much to the trainer that took the best pictures of the baby whale had a great time
930,9/28/2015,1,"I went on a Saturday and the crowds were very thick, I mean at some point you have to admit it's full and quit selling tickets. There was this weird stink in the air everywhere you went that smelled like a mixture of chlorine and feces.The orcas were kept in terrible conditions, the tanks were way too small for animals their size. They also seemed to be sick because all of their dorsal fins were collapsed. The guides spewed out false information that seemed to be designed to make us believe that the animals were all being taken care of better than they would be in the wild, which makes no sense. The food was also disgusting, I got a hamburger that was served cold. There was trash all over the place and the ticket takers were rude and seemed annoyed at the thought of helping anyone find their way around. There was also no parking."
931,7/28/2017,1,"Me and my family are from San Diego we went to Sea World a few years back and it was a very bad experience the workers by the shark exhibition where very rudeâ€. There we're unannounced closures, basically we did not get to see anything or very little of the parkmany of the shows were not runningit was such a shame and a huge waste of money"
932,11/25/2015,5,"Shamu = shamwow! and fun for everyone.It's a well-known fact that we spectators love to see humans and animals interact for our entertainment. Unfortunately, I'm too young to have witnessed the wonderful shows at the Coliseum with humans, lions, tigers, bears, etc. But I trust that the ancient accounts from spectators like Ignatius, who noted the ancient crowd's overwhelming enthusiasm stirred by animal trainer / priest Saturus during his performance with a boar, bear, and leopard simultaneously. According to Ignatius, it was truly a can't miss, one-time-only event.As exciting as those shows must have been, I'm sure that the Seaworld of today would equally thrill the plebians of that period, just as it now thrills their modern ilk.As testimony to the entertainment value of this show, it should be noted that not one negative review has ever been posted or even written about this form of entertainment - just as no ancient texts negatively portray the aforementioned 'ad bestias' spectacles.Sure, without the benefit of modern technology there were a few mishaps back then, but the ancients understood that sometimes happens - hence the Latin term mea culpa (my bad). Plus the ancients also understood how clearly unforseeable it was for a killer animal of any variety to act out against its captors.I can't wait until they take this show on the road to a local pool near you. If Barnum and Bailey can do it, I know the folks at Seaworld are equally capable - of anything. As such, I look forward to great white sharks and polar bears inclusion into future acts. Why should killer whales get to have all the fun?Speaking of increasing the fun for everyone: In future shows, as in Roman times, at least one lucky spectator should be chosen by the emperor (or local tribunal) to spontaneously join the show.Though the emperors and tribunals of today, unlike Roman times, shouldn't limit the potential 'pool' of candidates to one religious group. That wouldn't comport with our modern sense of religious freedom and equal (human) rights. In the same way we as a society reject (human) bondage and unlawful (human) imprisonment, limiting the privilege of being chosen to one specific religious group would be morally repugnant."
933,5/8/2016,4,"I love coming here because it reminds me of my childhood. Although still fun it's not the same. The orcas look sad now, every time I see them, and the show is no where near as good, probably because the trainers don't get in the water anymore. Also there was protesters outside the parking entrance and I can definitely see how that could turn away people. But I'll still come back here because it's fun."
934,6/21/2017,5,"We had an incredible time at Sea World over Spring Break. From the shows to the service, everything was perfect!"
935,7/29/2014,4,"Sea World is a must go place on the bucket list. Great Parking and easy to access the park. They are fully staffed and customer service is up there with other theme parks! They added a few rides since last time I visited but definitely worth taking your kids to check out the petting tanks, see the shows and ride on the rides. Everyone was very helpful and the customers were well behaved. They do have camps for kids so some events to get a bit busy and you do have people trying to bring their dogs inside and gets denied....leave them at home cause they kennels get full and people are turned away and they rage."
936,6/27/2014,3,"I have always loved seaworld but for my birthday trip, it was fun but not as fun as the previous yearly trips...The shamu show has REALLY gone down. Maybe because of the blackfish movie but there was no direction. The trainers just stand there and practically does nothing. They use to speak and introduce each whale and tell us about them. A child usually gets picked to take a picture and etc. Now? Nothing. The whales come in, gets a treat and goes off and does their own stunts. And one of them clearly was not paying attention. Show was good and still fun. Lots of splashes but not uniform.The trainers even looked like they DIDNT want to be there...I did go see the dolphin show, which was still good. Exactly the same as the years before.Next time, I will try the one in florida."
937,7/18/2018,5,"This is better than any aquarium. SeaWorld does a fantastic job providing education for kids on sealife and conservation. My kids love to go at least twice a month! They love all the up close and hands on experiences provided, and learn tons about their favorite sea creatures."
938,9/25/2017,3,"Once in the park the prices and experiences aren't what we had hoped. Â Not sure I would hurry back to have a ""bleh"" sort of experience."
939,6/11/2018,4,It's been over 20 yrs since my husband has been there so we decided to take him.. I had bought an annual pass a few months back and this was the first opportunity we had a chance to go.. since something happened to my pass employees was telling us I had to go to customer service which was a forever line so I asked another employee if I can use the kiosk she said yes so I told my husband to get out of line i tried paying and all of a sudden they said i could pay there that i had to go to customer service for that.. where we were in the first place we waited about an hour to finally get some help it didnt end there the employee that was helping us didnt know what to do and for some reason they couldn't print out our annual pass so instead I got a pass for the day and they told us to go to customer service again before we leave!! Â The employees to be trained more and they all should be all in the same page on how ur where to direct customers..
940,7/27/2017,3,"RATS . Big ones , everywhere . Also the food wasn't the best I mean for the price your paying you would at least hope it is . The animals literally look like they are dying inside their coves . Not the best but alright at entertainment ."
941,6/9/2016,3,"This is not a bad place, really. In case you watched that documentary (Blackfish), and were dissuaded otherwise, you might be surprised by all this place does have to offer; the Sea World show emcees routinely point out the involvement of the park's sea life rescue program and the importance of respecting and protecting the natural habitat of ocean's environment, so you feel like the place is really committed to the survival of all marine species. And if that's not an issue, then you might value the fact that you can often get a value pass that includes several Southern california attractions (such as Sea World and Universal Studios), so you know you're getting your money's worth. If you live within a reasonable driving distance, the season passes are also a bargain; these are especially handy if you have a little someone who dreams of becoming one of the Shamu riders when he/she grows up!However, everything else in Seaworld (like most theme parks), is very expensive. Food, drinks, souvenirs, and anything else you can imagine comes highly priced. But you may feel it's all worth the money spent because you'll have some great photos, along with the wonderful memories/experiences you and your family will never forget. BTW: yes, the Food Pass will save you money, but you'll feel like you have to eat (and wait in line -even for a drink) at least three times to get your money out of it."
942,5/30/2016,5,"We made Sea World the first amusement park for our little girls, and it was a great choice. Â Even on Memorial Day weekend, it was not as crowded as other parks. Â The park is VERY clean. Â The staff is incredibly helpful and SOOOO friendly. Â Most of the guests in the park are pretty friendly too. Â It is an expensive day, but what amusement park is not? Â We absolutely loved the Bayside Skyride, the Flyin Fish in the Sesame Street Bay of Play and the Dolphin Show. Â I am looking forward to coming back!"
943,7/27/2017,3,"Three issues: Â A few years ago, I Â joined a night kayaking trip and we paddled on the north side of Sea World to watch the fireworks. I was shocked to see all of the penguins in a large open- fenced in area that were exposed to the loud nightly blast of fireworks. Each time the fireworks blasted the penguins shook. Â If we are to put animals inside during the 4th of July to protect their ears and lessen fear from the noise.......what about the penguins? Â This was something I otherwise would not have been aware of. Privacy ? Last summer when I purchased a season pass for my grand-kids and myself, we had to give a fingerprint. I used the tickets to go last week before the pass expired. This time we had to allow our picture to be taken in order to be let in. I offered to show the booth attendant a chance to look at my drivers license as an alternative. I was told no, to enter I had to let them take a picture for both myself and the minor children. Sea World now has a photo and prints on file. Too much.Season pass-? not again.A few months ago, I received an email from the Orlando sister Sea World. it was for another pass holder confirming arranged plans. I called and was told it was an error. I asked if the member database was hacked. I was told at that time no. Â Recently I was told by someone in administration that it was hacked.Data is hacked all the time. Do we want to give an entertainment venue our photo/fingerprints and email?"
944,8/20/2013,4,"Friends who know me cracked up in disbelief that we were planning a trip to SW. The guy that avoids theme parks, and is not particularly fond of others children. Yep, call me crazy. Well guess what ye of little faith? Danimal liked! Yeah the tree hugger side of me thought turning sea mammals into circus clowns was kinda sad, but I pushed aside those feelings and enjoyed the shows. And places like this where kids are entertained and happy, make me happy as well since I didn't see one brat, er loving child, scream or cry. Food choices are slim and way over priced of course. 2 ""flatbread pizzas"", 2 local craft beers=$40+. But they do have Stone Brewery brews! The food/beer line was surprisingly not too long either, unlike The Diz up in Analslime. Even though I dislike Budweiser, I was disappointed that they no longer have the free Bud tastings I had been told about by several friends. Will I be making another visit soon? Not likely, unless by some crazy misfortune that I marry into a family with small kids. Like that'll ever happen. Customer service note: Mi' Lady forgot that we were going to have a public transportation weekend, and opted for the $15 parking when making the purchase online. I stood in a fast moving line for 5 minutes and one of the many staff members on duty credited it back all with a smile. Thanks! Free beer money!"
945,4/22/2012,4,"My hubby hates to take me here because of all the none sense that he says he has to put up with. Whenever I'm here, I start a list of animals I wanna own: polar bear, sea turtle, shamu, clown fish, dolphins and penguins. Oh, this is a list Â of animals I want from Sea World; there's another for SD Zoo! Â I want panda, white tiger, brown bears, and lions! Â Anyhow, I love coming here because it's so interesting to see all the animal, especially when you get to feed the dolphins. However, it suck that you have to pay $6 to help Sea World feed dolphins that they would have feed them to begin with. What else are they going to do, not feed them?!?!?!? Â =_=!!!Sea World has improved this year from last. Sea World added the Shark Encounter attraction, which has an underground tank tunnel that you get to feel as if you're surrounded by water. Â I LOVE LOVE LOVE the tunnel, but I only wish it was LONGER!Another HUGE thing they've changed is that they no longer charge for the rides!!!!!!!! Â For those who been to Sea World before, not only do you pay $73 to get into the park, but then YOU HAD TO PAY FOR THE RIDES!!!!! Â It felt like a TOTAL RIPPED OFF!!!!! Â So now they no longer do that, I think I'll be visiting the park a little more, or actually stay a little longer since I'm not a local. Â If you were turned off by Sea World before, come try again!!! Â Sea World has has changed for the better! Â Plus, you're helping to support to sea animals who's dying fast in our world!"
946,6/25/2018,5,"I have been coming here for a long long time and have always been a big fan. Sad to see the many changes to some animal shows and exhibits, but absolutely thoroughly entertained by their new night shows. Â The night shows have a Vegas style energy, and excitement that's very new and different from anything Seaworld has had before. Some of the other changes seem to include more commercialization geared towards selling food and trinkets to tourists that turn me off, but are likely required for Â their survival. As a local, I must add that I am glad they significantly reduced their use of fireworks during the summer for my dog's sake. Overall, they lost some of their innocence as a local family friendly ocean theme park and are now more glitzy with awesome shows and rides that should appeal to the masses."
947,6/14/2017,5,"I haven't been here in years. I loved the new shows which focus on conservation, and the environment. Great place for my five year old niece and my teen sons. The new manta roller coaster was super scary and fast. Journey to Atlantis still my favorite ride of all time."
948,7/15/2016,4,"we bought annual passes just to make our girl happy. There were a lot of shows, from sealions, whale, dolphin, sesame street elmo and friends and so on. On Independence day, there is beautiful fireworks at 9.30 pm. On halloween, there were celebration too. On christmas, they were inviting all special guests to celebrate. There were lots of souvenirs stores, convenience stores, restaurants and some rides."
949,10/10/2015,2,eh it was on lots of waiting for the shamu show which is pretty much always the same as you can predict. It kind of lost its appeal somehow lately. The trainers seemed less enthusiastic than they had been a few years ago when I went. I found the park sort of dirty too like there was gum and trash places that could easily have been picked up the glass on almost all of the exhibits was dirty or scratched. Get your act together seaworld!
950,8/8/2015,1,"Can't Stomach ItTook our 2 children there and aside of the extremely high cost of ordinary food, I felt liketaking animals from the sea, forcing them to live in the equivalent of a fishbowl and making them do tricks to eat is counterintuitive to everything they say they stand for. If you pay for this like we did, we are all contributing to a greedy, unethical way of doing business that only benefits SeaWorld's stakeholders."
951,7/9/2016,4,"Last year for the killer whale show. Eventhough it was good, it's good that they going to end it. Also stop breeding killer whale as well. The best killer whale shows are at night. 9 pm it starts. Music and Live dj. Had lots of fun. My daughter loves it. You can pay a lil bit more I think $21 to park up close so you don't have to walk so far to the entrance. Love the new Hawaii theme show with alcoholic drinks. Reminds me Hawaii."
952,6/5/2016,2,"Sea world is beautiful. I can stay here all day. Dolphin trainers seems nice. Watching Dolphins and Shamu swimming around in a tiny pool, I am happy but I feel sad for them. Just sad. Too sad. I can't bare to watch anymore. T. T I'm willing to pay more to see them in sea. I guess this is my last time going to Sea World. I want to see them in ocean by luck in a boat-tour next time. I want to see them in ocean or a much much larger space. That will make me feel happier too."
953,9/23/2013,4,"I love Seaworld! I used to go here every single year. I have nothing, excellent things to say about Seaworld. It truly is a great place to go with family or friends. It might not be as ""magical"" as Disneyland, but everyone who goes will enjoy everything that Seaworld has to offer. They have plenty of things to do ranging from shows, exhibits, food, rides and games. As far as the shows go, my personal favorites are the shamu show, dolphin show, Cirque de la mer and the sea otter show. The shamu show will leave you in pure amazement. All of the shows here are well executed and will leave you laughing and smiling. They also have a few rides now. These rides aren't crazy like roller coasters that you would see at Six Flags, but at least it gives you the option to do something else besides watching shows or going to exhibits. The penguin exhibit is a great place to go too. It's even better if you are able to watch the penguins while they are being fed. It's absolutely hilarious!The food here is pretty good considering it is an amusement park. I remember two places the most. Shipwreck Reef Cafe is my favorite place to eat. They have everything from burgers to seafood salads to salmon to baby back ribs! A very good place to eat! My second favorite is Mama Stella's Pizza Kitchen. They have pizza, salads, lasagna, eggplant Parmesan an assorted desserts. Seaworld is a great place to come with your family or as a date place. It's fun and exciting for all ages! Have fun!!"
954,4/8/2016,4,"It's been over 8 years since I've been to SeaWorld, I wanted to see the Shamu and other sea animals again. We watched the Shamu show (but the trainer and whale don't perform together in the water anymore). We heard the Shamu will be released into the wild or stop breeding them in captivity. I think this is good for them.The food prices aren't too bad, I especially liked the rotisserie chicken and salad from Shipwreck Reef Cafe. If you have a AAA card, you can buy the ticket from AAA office for $65/day."
955,9/4/2017,5,"Had the best time! Such a clean facility and everything is in pristine condition. Love sea world and it's one of my kids favorite parks! We even went to aquatica today which was a bit small, but had a blast!"
956,3/29/2018,1,One only for the sea creatures. So unhelpful from initial entrance to eating. So not Disneyland where there's more people and yet waaaayyyy better at directing crowds. Have not been here in twenty years and will never come back. Save hundreds of dollars and hours of time and go to La Jolla and see sea lions for free.
957,9/3/2017,5,"I haven't been here in 10 years and still loved it. All you can eat was definitely worth it. Front of line pass was great but did not notice any reserved seating, that was only bad thing. Rides were great for family with teenagers. Can tell they really take care of animals."
958,8/13/2017,5,"Wow how things have changed! The last time I visited SeaWorld was about 6 years ago, and I did not like it at all. But things have really changed and my family and I enjoyed every show and ride; spent all day there! The two night shows are a must! Looking forward to going back again soon."
959,7/26/2015,1,"I came here with my brother and my niece and nephew last month. Â This is a bit of a delayed review, but I've been thinking about SeaWorld ever since.First of all, the rides seem outdated. Â I guess they think it's 1985. Â Time for a remodel.Second, the prices are really over the top. Â The 4 of us bought burgers for lunch and we ended up spending about $60. Â Wow. Â I don't know how much my brother spent for the tickets - I was afraid to ask.Third and most important, my niece, who is 7 said to me she ""didn't think the whales and seals and dolphins were happy"". Â I asked my brother if she had watched that documentary that came out last year and he assured me she had not, so she picked up on this on her own. Â Again, she's 7 and she figured out all by herself that these poor mammals are miserable, being kept captive and forced to do tricks for food. Â How sad and pathetic.I will not be returning to any SeaWorld and advise you to keep your kids clear of this place."
960,6/28/2016,5,"We had a great time at SeaWorld! There are so many shows to choose from. Here are my favorite ones:-- Killer Whales: Up Close-- One Ocean-- Shamu's Celebration: Light Up the Night-- And of course.... Fireworks!TIP: Penguins Up-Close aren't listed on the park map, so they're easy to miss out on once you're here. Book online ahead of time.Also, thank you so much Sea World for finally stopping the cruelty of making killer whales perform tricks and also thank you for stopping the breeding of them."
961,5/4/2017,4,Girls had a lot of fun but we didn't think it compared to Disneyland / world. Prices were reasonable and a lot to do and see. Also I saw no indication of any animal cruelty going on with any of the exhibits. The Seagull population and problems there are out of control however. I saw a guys hotdog get swooped out of his hand and the bird pooped on him as he was flying away. Talk about insult to injury !!!
962,8/14/2015,2,"What I have witnessed today was pretty horrendous. Well let me first start off by saying I have seen blackfish and it may be one sided but I decided to go for myself as I felt the need to form my own opinion on the matter. This is an unbiased review.I was lucky enough to receive free admission (besides $16 parking) for being a military dependent. Otherwise, I would have paid a whopping 90 bucks!! I will tell you right now it was absolutely not worth that much money, I cannot even fathom how the huge families manage to pull that together. Although the food prices weren't as bad as I anticipated, and it's mostly typical amusement park foods and a couple restaurants.Every staff member I encountered today seemed a bit less than thrilled to be there, often at times looking confused and listless. Saw a girl walking through the stands at the stadium literally just shootin' bubbles out of a bubble gun. No interaction or smile to anyone just you know.. Shootin' bubbles. I didn't really get the point but it was a bit amusing in the moment lol.Well first order of business was to see the skin-sucking fish, and apparently they weren't hungry today so that was kind of a let down.So then we decided to go see the orca show called one ocean. Approaching the ""stadium"" I was able to see an orca on the surface of the water in the holding tank. And let me tell you it really is quite a sight to see. Â Such a beautiful breathtaking animal! When the show started there was an immense amount of people trickling into the stands. As I watched the whales perform their tricks I realized how barbaric this whole thing really is. Yeah the tricks are interesting but you have to look deeper into what you are supporting. Thousands of people cheering on animals that are there purely for human entertainment. And the big ""money makers"" for SeaWorld. I found it absolutely appalling and I had to leave. I would much rather see these creatures in their natural habitats living freely rather than being trained to do pretty tricks for food.We then went into the shark tank area which was okay but seriously reeked. And I definitely wasn't comfortable going into the underwater tunnel (its a personal traumatic nightmare issue lol) but I made it through and you are only in there for about a minute but boy that was a long minute! Well needless to say I will not be returning, and I do not recommend the support of this stuff. Â I would say look into alternatives to see animals not in captivity. I am researching and it seems a whole lot cheaper and a more calm, positive experience especially for children I would imagine. My heart goes out to all of those animals that reside here and at other locations."
963,5/29/2017,4,Came here yesterday. Â Park was pretty crowded but the Atlantis and Manta rides were not too long. Â I highly recommend both rides especially Atlantis which is like a traditional log ride but has a roller coaster element to it. Â Nice park to walk around and enjoying viewing all the sea life. Â Most staff were friendly. Â Lots of food options but pricey. Â Dining plan is a good way to go if you spend a whole day at the park. Â Their website was sluggish and I had to wait till the next day to get tickets. Â The phone app is useless. Â I downloaded it a few times and it still did not work on my iPhone.
964,4/11/2017,1,"My nephews were in town last weekend and wanted to come here. I was excited cuz I came often as a kid. Unfortunately things have changed, long lines, semi entertaining shows, horrible food, and poor customer services. I was really disappointed and so were the kids. We went to LegoLand the next day and boy did they saved me. Had a wonderful time there. Save your money and don't come here."
965,6/3/2016,5,"SeaWorld has upgraded a lot from when I was little. I remember it not being so great when I went for a school field trip when i was little. Now that I'm an adult I really enjoyed Sea World with all their new stuff that they have. Although the shows did seem a little bit boring (except for sea lions live). There is still a lot of attractions to do such as, getting your hands clean by tiny little fishes which is probably the best part, to seeing sharks or dining with Shamu. You could even ride the rides such as the Manta which is a really great roller coaster. Or Journey to Atlantis which is mediocre. They also have a lot of rides for you and your toddler to ride on, even a section for your kids to enjoy. I believe sea world has gotten a lot better and if they keep this up they are going to do really well."
966,7/24/2013,2,"In college, we used to watch Aladdin a lot, in my RA's room. Sure, it was made for kids, but the creators did such a good job of throwing in little bits to keep the parents in the audience entertained. Mild double-entendre. More complicated and subtle humor interwoven into the slapstick kids' stuff. Sea World doesn't do that. The shows are targeted for five year olds. And they're kinda cheesy. The rides are so-so. The food is awful. And the price is high.Save your money, buy a cheap snorkel at Target, and go find a nice little spot on the water to look at animals that are in their natural habitat. It's just better and with the money you save, drive up to LA and treat yourself to a massage or something."
967,6/2/2017,5,"I loved the experience and my kids had an amazing time. Even though the Orca whale show is over, you can still get a close encounter with them through a looking glass. The food is super reasonably priced. I was surprised to see that Sea World housed so many ride attractions. I would definitely go back again. I just wish the park was open longer but it's understandable that the marine life needs their rest . The park was very clean . The staff and personnel were very accommodating. We didn't like our photo which was taken in the morning and they went out of their way to retake our photo in the afternoon . Great job Sea World keep up the awesomeness!"
968,4/2/2016,4,"The shows are not as exciting as I remember them. Â My kids were a bit bored and end up leaving. My favorite attraction is the Bayside skyrise , the view was amazing. After 5 the park is almost empty, it's the best time to go on the rides. Atlantis and shipwreck are water rides, so beware you will get soaking wet."
969,8/14/2017,5,I has so much fun at sea world! We went for my little nieces & nephews birthday and they had a blast! My favorite was the orca show! They were amazing to watch! The orcas and others looked like the adored their trainers! The trainers all looked like they really loved and cared for the animals. I will definitely be back!
970,1/28/2016,4,"It is very interesting place! You can see many sea â€‹â€‹animals, your children will be happy. You can touch some fish and skat. Tickets are very expensive, and it didn't Â meet my expectations."
971,9/5/2017,4,Amusement park was awesome .... the manta roller coaster is the best ride there plenty of things to do ... best part is that your more than able to do it all in a day ( if you go during the week). But the food is awful had a churro and it was very stale had stir fry and it was very salty .... over all a very great place for the family ....
972,10/8/2013,5,"If I could plan my family vacay all over again I would plan for another day at Sea World. Â One day just isn't enough.Catch the shows. Â The shows are incredible. Â Sit in the splash zone. Â You only live once... YOLO, right? ^_-Get the meal wristbands. Â Totally worth it."
973,11/6/2013,3,"Not happy about the hype. People always rave about this place which practically speaking is not that great. I expected a lot more when your paying nearly 70$ for the ticket. Liked only the shamu show and one other was the dolphin show.There were 4 or 5 different animal shows. All the shows were just once in a day. So I recommend you to go in the weekend, in that way you have two or three shows in a day and you don't want to see all the shows in a hurried way."
974,4/23/2017,3,Pretty pricey...need to show up at least 20 to 30 minutes before each show or you'll be late due to lining up. Great place for kids age 5 and up maybe not much for toddlers though. Park closes at 5..not enough time to view the whole place.
975,7/15/2016,4,This place is amazing!4 stars because it's an amazing experience! I know how they got the whales and dolphins so no five stars from me ! But the experience is great the park is well maintained and bathrooms are clean! Everything is expensive but I was expecting that ! My biggest issue with sea world is about the big sea animals not having enough Â room to swim around and also they should have the opportunity to hunt fish and other animals just like they would in the wild! Feeding them small fish as a consistent diet doesn't seem that great to me! I think having bigger swimming areas and having the animals actually hunt something would be beneficial to the mental and physical health of the animals! But overall a very satisfying day out !
976,5/5/2017,5,My husband and I just took our son to Sea World and had a great time! My son loved seeing the marine animals (and possibly my husband more than my son)! Prices were right on par with what you would expect from a park like this. But the shows were all free! Which was awesome! The animals all looked very happy and content and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing the marine animals we would otherwise never get to see if it weren't for a park like this.
977,8/23/2017,5,"As a member, we have cool mini trips to SeaWorld with the kids! It's always a fun adventure. Even without the shamu show."
978,6/17/2018,5,"Always enjoy Sea World, and am disappointed there are people who would attack such a fine institution that has been around doing tremendous work on behalf of our Oceans and Marine life long before many of these activists were born. It is a great place to visit and bring your family, with fun attractions, animal interactions, Rides, food and weather. They have been affiliated with world renowned Oceanographic Institutions for decades before it was popular. They have great compassion for their Marine life and their guests. Don't believe those that would try to convince you not to go, they have an ax to grind, that serves no purpose. Sea World, the only institution in Southern California with an on call staff to rescue sea life, bring them back to health and release them back into the wild."
979,6/17/2017,1,Sea world sucks now! Don't waste your money! If I wanted to learn about the orcas I would of YouTube it! Worst show ever! Not to mention the dolphin show is not the same either! Boring boring boring! I will not be returning again!
980,4/13/2015,5,"The kids loved seaworld.I think my kids are have dolphin and orca,Because they splash in our bathtub like they do.Friendly staffSaves $23 dollars buying tickets from my work.We didn't see all the attractions, but that's our fault We will come back another time."
981,8/20/2016,5,"The bad reviews made towards the workers here about how they treat the animals, are ridiculous. The animals are not being mistreated and if you feel that they are then don't go to this place. I'm sure you eat some type of meat but don't complain about that. Now, I recommend getting your tickets online because you get a big discount. Don't know what the time frame of the online deals but check before you go. That's what I did. I also went in hungry because I purchased the eat all day package. Ribs, chicken, burgers, fish, etc. You get a full meal every hour on the hour if you want. From opening to close. I went in hungry and walked out very full. Could've used a wheel chair that I was so full. Nice place."
982,6/23/2015,3,"I want to hate this place.But seriously, how can I really? I get to see these amazing animals up close, something that I would never be able to do if they didn't exist. I wish they had more places with shade tho, bc the sun is relentless.. Or AC ..but you could always hide out in the attic zone and chill with the polar bear."
983,8/19/2013,2,"Prepare to bring lot of money... everything here is expensive. The food is over priced.$3.25 for a small pack of chip.$3.75 for 12 oz bottle of water.$8.25 for a hot dog, a small soda & small bag of chips$1.00 to refill a soda but you have to pay $11.00 for the container at the Shamu's show."
984,5/3/2016,5,"I haven't seen Blackfish and I don't know ALL the great things that SeaWorld does to rehab and restore marine life, but I do know that I'm not perfect, not everyone agrees with everything I do and therefore, I appreciate when I am given a chance to be heard directly (not thru the grapevine), and allowed the opportunity to improve in areas where and when I can. Â Having said this, I give others the chance to be heard and improve where and when they can and so far, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE SEAWORLD and all of my experiences with them thus far (as a child, and now as an adult). Thank God I haven't given up on them.I have a 1 yr, 4 month old baby who completely adores Elmo. Â SeaWorld has the BEST of Elmo in the SoCal area, without a doubt, and has become baby's heaven on earth this past month since buying our annual pass.If you're on the fence about SeaWorld, go! Â See for yourself, experience for yourself, and GIVE yourself the opportunity to be touched in a positive way. Â I have a feeling you're going to be surprised at how much fun you will have had.Oh, and their all day dining deal is SO CONVENIENT and great! Â No need to pull your wallet out every single time you want a drink, snack or meal. Just allow your wrist band to be scanned and eat or drink up!THANK YOU, SEAWORLD."
985,8/6/2017,1,"We decided to go as a family trip and it was a big disappointment. My kids were excited to go for the rides, but all of the ones we tried to go on were down after waiting for several minutes in line. By dusk most people had left the park and was empty with with no lighting in certain sections. We got there at 1 pm and we were done 7."
986,6/14/2018,3,I've been to SeaWorld San Diego as well as Orlando. Although this Seaworld has a lot to offer and is a awesome park that seems to be growing every year there are a lot of things that can be improved upon. Positives are everything you'd hope to see at a SeaWorld you will see here and the Electic Eel and dolphin show were awesome (seemed to have more dolphins than Orl and included a couple of whales)! Negatives this park closes extremely early for a amusement w/ no firework show! And the worst part unfortunately which the whole family agreed upon was the new Orca Encounter I get seaworld is attempting to be more educational instead of giving a show but this was just very boring as compared to the old One Ocean Show if they could make the Orca Encounter more interactive for kids and families it def would make for the ultimate day! Still all in all love seaworld just hate they are letting negative press change what they do best
987,4/8/2014,4,"I think SeaWorld is great from a time to time treat. It's not big enough to really demand frequent visits, but since I only go every couple of years, I always look forward to visiting. I know in recent years SeaWorld has taken a bit of a publicity hit, and I in no way am excusing them, but I do feel that they are no better than any zoo or even some home pets.But I digress. The park is also a great place to take kids. The exhibits are very family oriented and give great viewing experiences to people of all ages (and heights). I've never met a kid who didn't love aquariums and this park has plenty of them!In all, if you feel bad for supporting them, I get it. But I still think the park is a great day get away from time to time."
988,10/1/2015,5,"We didn't get to seaworld until like 2:30-3pm but we got to do almost everything. Â They closed at 7 pm that night and we did just about everything except journey to atlantis and the pet's rule show. Â My favorite things were the little fishies by the entrance that eat your skin off your hands. Â I also really really enjoyed Manta. Â It didn't look that scary but it really took me by surprise. Â I work and disneyland so I have had my fair share of ride experiences, but OMG it was so fun!!!! I love seaworld!!! I enjoyed myself here way more than sand diego zoo. Â It was so much fun, I really want a year pass.And yes, I've already seen blackfish, but I don't care. Â It seems like a biased documentary that's trying to make them look bad. Â They don't mention all the animals seaworld ends up saving and releasing back into the wild...."
989,6/1/2015,1,"My last review was deleted, so I will edit because it was said to be based in ""the medias coverage."" Therefore I will leave a more personal narrative account of my visit to sea world. Last time I was there, an out of town guest wanted to go. So I took them to SD to visit sea world. It felt weird to be back there. I remember going as a kid and not really thinking about it this way. But this time around I felt bad and guilty that this entire park was based on the incapacitation of a wild beautiful huge exotic innocent animal. I had always looked at sea world as just another amusement part, except this time it wasn't. If yelp wants to remove my review go ahead- If you think it's based on medias coverage. It's actually based on my OWN visit within the last couple of months + my awareness of animal rights. It just so happens the media is also reporting on this topic, contemporaneously. My personal opinion on sea world is- it's an odd place. I won't take my kids there not because sea world is getting bad media coverage. But because last time I was there it made me realize I hate it. I don't think it's a fun place to visit, and a bit creepy from my last experience. It's priced at Disneyland prices but definitely not as fun or entertaining. There wasn't much to do in the park. And I was a bit bored honestly. When I have out of town guests in the future, I won't take them to sea world. There are better uses of time/money. I live in LA and the drive to SD for sea world is just not worth it. I think the combination of animals and them parks is a bit outdated and strange. Some things just don't go together well- like Legos and theme parks or like animals and theme parks. I like animals and nature I also love theme parks, however not the two combined."
990,6/3/2015,1,"SeaWorld is a glorified circus in my humble opinion, This park makes me really sad. I wish that I had not gone, it was just really negative for me. When I was a child I didnt understand and liked it. It started my interest in marine mammals when I was super young, but as an adult who goes in the ocean frequently I was just sad to see the animals in tanks performing and put on display. Â I like aquariums still. I very much enjoy Birch Aquarium near UCSD. I feel like they are more educational and only host smaller marine life that doesnt require so much space. The marine animals located at Seaworld are in the ocean themed theme park for the amusement of park goers and I dont see how the park has the best interest of the animals in mind. The nightly summer firework display should be put to a stop. I was appalled. The fireworks at SeaWorld constitute animal cruelty. Â I cannot imagine how loud the fireworks are underwater for the marine life located inside the park....As a scuba diver with hearing that is not as sensitive as marine life. I can personally say from experience how loud certain sounds are underwater. When I am diving and a boat goes over it is very loud and disorienting. I never get used to it. I imagine that the animals also are sensitive to the booming sounds above. Seaworld should either become an aquarium or phase out the animals and become a non animal based ocean theme park.  I would recommend driving up to Disneyland for fireworks and a theme park that doesnt exploit animals for entertainment. There are SOOO many other great things to do in San Diego. You have no reason to go to Seaworld, it is a waste of money in my opinion. Check out the SD Zoo, go up to Julian, go snorkeling or scuba diving, checkout seaport village."
991,9/16/2017,5,"I've been going to Seaworld since I was 7yrs. This place continues to grow and evolve. Gotta love the views and up close possibilities. This is my 2nd year in a row that I've been in September, truly a beautiful day, not too hot, lines were fairly short and the weather cooperated"
992,4/17/2016,4,"We wandered around and saw the Orca's along with the other shows excluding the dolphin show which was closed for renovations.Staff was friendly and there was enough to do even when they loose the Orca show. Â They have a roller coaster, shows and other things to keep the kids busy. Â I think the 12 and under crowd would love this place. Older kids would probably get bored here if you came here more than once every few years."
993,3/26/2016,4,No Dolphins or the tram ride those are big-ticket items that you pay for that for that however everything else was just awesome especially the hospitality from every single person that works there every one of them was more than helpful very cheerful and see what they were really happy to help! I got a year pass and I'm looking forward to going as much as I can.
994,8/10/2017,5,"I've been going to Sea World since I was 5 years old. My love for the oceans and all the animals that inhabit them all started because of this amazing place! I now frequent Sea World with my daughter and I can see her love for the oceans growing as well. You can easily see that Sea World cares about conservation and promoting the well being of our planet. I genuinely don't understand how anyone could oppose such a magical, philanthropic company. Keep doing what you're doing, Sea World!!!"
995,12/13/2016,1,"Don't waste your money coming here in the off season. Â We took our child here on december 12th, mainly for the christmas activities they advertised and to do the penguin encounter. Â ALL of the advertised christmas activities were closed, most of the park was closed. Â It seemed weird with everything locked up and shut down. We asked about the penguin encounter less than 2 hours after the park opened and we were told they were only doing one encounter that day and they already did it. Â Even if all of the attractions and stores and restaurants were open, I still don't think it would be worth the ridiculous amount they charge. Â We wouldn't recommend this attraction to anyone, we felt it was a ripoff with everything closed (probably with everything open as well) and the park is almost sad to be in."
996,3/28/2016,4,"It was my first time here & kinda felt bad for going after all the media controversy, but needless to say it was a good experience. Most of the staff was very friendly & answered all my questions. This is the perfect place to take children over the age of 3 and up."
997,8/21/2017,4,The service they'd provided was great. I went there with my family and we had a really fun time. Food was expensive but expected so doable for a theme park. I will suggest that they should change the show a little from time to time since it can be boring. Overall I enjoyed going there and my favorite ride was shipwreck and favorite show was the dolphin. I would love to stay for the circus act on mission bay but was too late. Next time!
998,8/20/2017,5,Great place for kids.. Last time my wife and I went and we enjoyed it but now we have kids so it was there time.. They had s Great time. You can actually buy tickets on there website for cheaper. It didn't make sense but yea. Would recommend this place
999,2/10/2017,5,It's sea world. It was a blast! Â The team there is always ready to assist and keep the kids smiling.
1000,7/16/2017,5,Love this place the kids had a lot of fun the dolphin show is the best we will be back next year and stay more than One day thank you sea world
1001,7/2/2016,5,"Well worth the visit, especially this is the last year of the whales/shamu show! Mid week is the best time to go not to many visitors and the lines for the rides are super short. Max wait time 12mins."
1002,8/31/2015,5,"Very much enjoyed our visit. Â This was my 2nd time and my grandson's first time. Â I love the all you can eat wristbands, definitely a bargain if you are big eaters like us. Â The shows are great, Pets Rule is probably one of my favorites. Â Souvenirs are pricey but then they are pricey at any amusement park you go to. Â I wasn't thrilled that I had to pay 1.00 to rent a locker for one hour outside of the Journey to Atlantis ride when the locker rental was free at the Manta ride. Â That didn't make much sense but what could I do?Shipwreck rapids is a fun ride but the amount of time it takes for a raft to make it up to the landing is ridiculous. Â No wonder the lines for that ride are so insanely long. Â Looking forward to taking my 8 grandkids down there next year."
1003,3/20/2018,1,"Would give 0 stars. Their shows are the only decent thing, and they make it to where you would have to stay 5+ hours to see each show by making most shows 15 mins apart so you have to choose between one or the other and the other won't start again Â for 2-3 more hours. Over half of their restaurants and rides were closed on a weekend day during spring break. Paid over $150 for tickets (online where it's cheaper) plus had to pay another $25 for parking. Animal habitats and exhibits are extremely outdated and you can tell they've spent their money on new shops/restaurants versus making the animal habitats nicer. The turtles were absolutely miserable, you could tell. And many other animals had horrible living conditions. Their habitats are made of fake rocks and trees and looks like they haven't been updated since the 90s. Super sad and depressing. I cannot believe a park taking in that much money was so trashy and outdated. Go to the San Diego Zoo instead. It's half the price and much, much nicer."
1004,7/24/2015,4,"Shamu!!!!!!!!!! That's the first thing everybody thinks of whenever Sea World is brought up in a conversation. I came here a while back with my dad and my cousin and had a pretty good time. Although the 2 hour drive from LA might seem long, it is not that bad (granted, I didn't drive). I don't remember much since its been years. But I do remember Sea World consisting of mostly animal watching, animal shows and just a few rides. The best and most popular show is the Shamu Show. Its always intriguing to see killer whales. Other show that I remember is a Sea Lion show which was pretty funny. The best ride here is definitely Atlantis - prepared to get soaked!"
1005,9/6/2015,5,Went to sea world today had a blast with my wife and daughter. Everything went great Â the shows Â the food! Then I go to a gift shop to buy my daughter a stuffed animal and my wallet is missing!! I go to guest services to report it lost Â and Â to see if anyone turned it in . In my mind I new that wallet was gone! The security asked me a few questions and I said Ima go look at last place I bought something. I left security my # and b4 I get to the place I was going I get a call sayin my wallet was turned in!!! I got back and everything was in there!!!!! Thanks a lot!! I guess there are still honest people !! Thanks SEA WORLD
1006,7/6/2016,4,"I've been to Sea World several of times in the past year, I recently got the year pass and the park never disappoints! I always have a blast. Although the shows have downgraded compared to the past years shows. Sad to say the shows aren't as fun and theatrical as they used to be. I recommend going during ""summer nights"" Â thats when the park is at its best. Overall Sea World is a fun learning environment, although what people complain over the animals care lets face it the park is for business and entertainment! The animals their are not the only ones in this world yet sea world does its best to care for them. I recommend going to sea world, filled with fun & learning!"
1007,9/11/2015,5,i love sea world it was a fun experience it always is the staff is nice and the animals look well taken care of. the shows are amazing and i love being able to purchase the food to feed the sea lions they are so smart . weekdays theres not much people which is great and of course some people are just screaming at Â their misbehaved children that makes it real awkward. i think they forget how to be a parent. i absolutely love coming to sea world there is alot of misinformation once that stupid movie blackfish came out but you can tell these animals are well taken care of i hope to continue to come each and every year
1008,6/4/2015,5,"OMG I like this place so much it is so much better than the theme park in my city. hehe Shamu Shamu Shamu. Also a lot of teachers and professors I know had a great childhood with this place. They knew acting orca since he was a baby. Â I however like any Sea World Amusement Park better than Disneyland. However, this park is constantly changing which is a bit much because for the average person 20 and over it is not worth the time to keep up. This park is small but a lot of fun. The food here is on the super side but most of the eateries do not open till later. They have some cool rides here which Yes you will get wet. I really enjoyed the shows here because it gets my adrenaline pumping. Some of it can get really rowdy at times. If you are here for business they do a great job of providing you a meeting spot"
1009,10/7/2015,4,"My first time being here went during the summer, there was other shows with sea lion and dolphin but the main performance which was the killer whales which was awesome. If you want a good seat which is the front you better come early and wait. Also, I seriously recommend to bring a sunblock, comfortable shoe, an extra clothes or a towel just in case. The place was well put, clean, really big, staffs were nice. Loved that there's plenty of interaction with the animals, roller coaster rides, its great for the family trip kids would love it."
1010,5/30/2018,5,Loved it made some amazing memories and enjoyed all the shows!!! Originally bought one day passes but they converted them to fun passes for us at guest services to be able to enjoy a second visit cheaper!!
1011,4/11/2017,5,Got a 55$ spring break day deal and figured why not ! It was really fun . The orca protesters were a bummer though . Over all I really enjoyed my day here and feeding the deals was so cool
1012,3/17/2018,5,We came back for another visit with our fun cards. This time we liked it even more. Didnt feel the need to have to do everything. More relaxed. Got a all you can eat pass and brought our refillable cup from laat time. Seaworld is awesome.
1013,9/29/2015,3,Wow this place has really become lack luster. When I was a kid it was so much better than it is today. I think a lot of that has to with the animal rights groups creating a ton of bad publicity but they have really tuned down their shows and made them pretty short. They do give a lot of educational info out now which I thought was good. It is certainly something to take the kids to or to see at least once in your life. The rides are cool and they have added a few new ones that are neat as well. The Manta was our fav for this trip. Food prices are OUT OF THIS WORLD! So be sure to bring a solid CC or a ton of cash if it is an all day trip cause its gonna hit the wallet hard.
1014,3/21/2016,1,"Yesterday 3/20/16, was the last day to redeem the preschool free pass. I used google voice on my cell phone to check the hours and it said SeaWorld was open until 9 pm yesterday. I drove 30 minutes to SeaWorld after work and was there 7:45 pm. I was informed by security that the park closed at 7:30 and would not let me in to redeem my pass. This morning I called SeaWorld at 8:30 am and waited 1 hour on hold to speak with someone. The lady I spoke with was unable to help me after I explained the situation. I asked for a manager and spoke with David in Orland contact center. He said the promotion has ended and cannot be extended. I am very disappointed that in light of the situation and all I went through to redeem my son's pass that no one was able to help me. This experience makes me never want to go to SeaWorld again. I have 4 kids to buy passes for and I was depending on that free pass for my preschooler. I find it hard to believe that there was absolutely nothing David could do to help me, whether it be an override or offering me a discount on the pass, something. He refused to give me his managers info or let me speak with anyone else."
1015,8/17/2015,5,"I haven't been to sea world in years but it won't take me that long to come back. We went on a Sunday in the summer and I was shocked at how uncrowded it felt. I only stood in lines for food and rides. Yes I said rides. I had no idea sea world had rides!The Sesame Street themed area was perfect for my 2 and 4 year olds. They have three rides, two water features for getting wet, a HUGE play house / ropes course, and a few separate areas for toddlers. I'm not a drinker but they also have beer stands throughout the park."
1016,7/8/2016,4,"This was my second visit to a Sea World park, the first as a child and now as an adult.Shows- They offer a variety of shows from Orcas to dancing cats and dogs. Each show lasts about 20 minutes and there is plenty of seating. The animal trainers are friendly and funny and you can tell they put a lot of work into the shows. I enjoyed all of them. Food- I can only speak for one place because I did not eat much in the park. However what I did eat wasn't bad and they run a really nice special where for 35.00 you can eat one plate every hour for the entire day. There are several restaurants that offer this. Rides- I only rode one ride but would be willing to try more in the future. There are 5 I think to choose from and the lines averaged about an hour. The one I chose was the shipwreck Rapids. It was a lot of fun but prepare to get WET!  Kids- there is a HUGE playground where all sizes of kids can play. A bouncy mat, rope climbing, bridges everything. There is also a small area for little tots to play out of the sun and in a safe padded area. Stores- the stores had the typical merchandise you would expect at a theme park but the prices were affordable. Parking- the lot isn't very big so it's a relatively short walk to the entrance. It's easy to bring food and walk back to the car and have lunch. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the park and would return although not often because you can see all there is to see in one day. It's great for a once in awhile place!"
1017,7/31/2015,5,Loved taking kids to Sea World. It was not as busy as I thought it would be. All shows and dinning with shamu was nice!
1018,7/27/2017,3,"Not much shade to hide from the strong summer sun! I have been to several amusement parks, and many offer plenty of shade and misters to their patrons. Sea World has no such respite. There is a splash area somewhere in the park, but my party was too exhausted from the scorch to find it. For us folks who are not in swim suits to get soaked, shade is copious amounts would have been a welcome amenity. Guests seeking shade must hide out in the penguin, shark or turtle exhibits. These attractions are lovely for a spell, but these areas are only a fraction of the park many wish to explore! Readers, be advised, there are no canopies covering the seats at the shows. Babies can't even remain protected from the sun's rays in their shaded strollers! Strollers are not allowed in the shows. Bottom line: hot and bright, bring an umbrella to supply your own shade!"
1019,7/27/2017,3,We love this place! The reason why I can only get three stars is because of the size of the orca tank. It's so upsetting to see these beautiful creatures trapped in a tiny pool. It should be four times the size that it is
1020,4/4/2015,5,"Over the past few years Sea World has been making the transition from straight amusement park to a educational learning experience. I've gone plenty of times as a kid and now I go 3 times a week because it's my job (I wipe tables and empty trash. It's a great summer job). I've always wanted to work there and it's a great way to learn more while keeping the park clean. My favorite part of Sea World is the Turtle Reef exhibit. I sometimes go on my days off to admire the beautiful Sea Turtles and fish interact. I also enjoy penguin encounter on the hot days where I can watch the Penguins waddle around and push each other. Also the fireworks during summer always make for a good time. Where else can you see this diverse amount of animals and learn so much? Of course Blackfish has made some very bad press for Sea World's mission. Yes, the Orcas could use a bigger enclosure and other perks, and Sea World is making a much larger (I believe it's 2 times the size) to make for a better experience. Most People who are so avidly against Sea World's domestication of Orcas would never even grow to appreciate them or care without the up close interaction Sea World provides. There are pros and cons to Sea World. If you see a sick Sea Lion on the beach abandoned by its mother, Who do you call? Or if thousands of birds are drowning in an oil spill, who can you count on to do everything they can to rescue them? Sea World has recused upwards of 32,000 Animals since 1965, and with the help of their parks, they can continue to rescue more. Please do not automatically hate Sea World without gathering all the facts. Thank you for reading my review and I hoped it helped"
1021,12/7/2016,1,"I am disappointed in the Customer Relations department. Â I was trying to purchase tickets online and had some questions, regarding ticket purchase error, park hours as the hours posted on ""I"" page are different from website. I needed to talk to a live person. When I called, a recording said that my call had a wait of 80 minutes and that I could choose to be called back to talk to a representative. Â No one called me back. Â I am not even in the park and I am already having customer service issues. Â I read that SeaWorld has cut jobs, but at the price they are charging, I would expect good if not excellent customer service, regardless. I am dreading going to the park; yes, I did purchase tickets, only because I did not want to disappoint a little girl for Christmas. Â SeaWorld, I will not return after this occasion."
1022,2/9/2015,3,I think I went to Sea World when I was a kid but not sure. Â Now that I have kids we decided to go. Â Kinda disappointing for small kids.Sea World is all about shows and so you have to wait around for these things in the hot sun and then sit and watch them in the hot sun. Â Okay I guess but that wasn't going to happen with my two small ones.The park itself is showing it's age and could use an updating. Â My son really loved the dolphins but it was super obvious that the enclosures for the dolphins and whales were waaaaaaaaaaay too small. Â I don't keep up on animal rights stuff but I agree that the tanks are inappropriately small for these animals.For the price and the annoying cost of parking it was just okay and I don't know that this would be something I would return for a visit unless my kids specifically asked.
1023,2/23/2013,4,"When you think of San Diego, you think of the beaches, the Coronado Bridge, the San Diego Zoo, and of course Sea World. I've been a season ticket holder since 1999 and still am even though I no longer live here. Â My current rating is my overall, but really has changed over the yearsRating as a kid: 5 stars of courseRating in my 20's: 5 stars, especially since I was here about 3 times a week and my little girl was still a little girl.Rating now: Just 3 stars. I think after 100+ visits the luster has changed for me.When it comes to a park with a few rides and sea animals/mammals, Sea World in San Diego is your one stop shop. Â My favorites include the shark encounter, petting pools, Shamu show, and feeding the dolphins. Â If you're local and have a season ticket, I suggest just hitting no more than 3 spots at a time so that you can ensure that you'll get your money's worth. When I lived here, this is what we did. We'd hit the park up 2 hours before closing, watch some shows, eat some dinner, and end the evening with their fireworks. If you're not local, then you have no choice and pay the hefty $70 for the whole day.Sea World is also a great place to have a party. When my teenager was in kindergarten, we rented part of the park for her and all her classmates. The personal tours and private dining was great. The Sea World team was fantastic. Overall, I suggest Sea World if you haven't been here or if you're vacationing in America's finest city. Not sure if they still do it, but their Fun Card when bought at the beginning of the year is good all year long. Check it out and find out. That's a deal for sure."
1024,7/2/2017,5,"I was incredibly surprised by SeaWorld! It was SO CLEAN and all of the staff from the housekeeers to the trainers were very helpful. It was awesome to see the whales and the dolphin experience was great as well. If I could change anything it would be to maybe dial back the number of gift shops (there are so many that it is actively distracting). We did the all day eating thing too... And because ""I'm going to get my money's worth"" I regretted that..."
1025,7/21/2017,1,$17 for parking. Â  Biggest rip off around. Â Tge park is great but expect as expensive day
1026,6/6/2015,5,"Park staff are extremely professional and friendly. Food is decent at best, but it's a theme park. The protesters out front were pretty ruthless. Why don't they do the same thing at the zoo? Got a one day family pass that allows us to come back for free until January. It's a good deal!"
1027,8/15/2015,4,I know that there is controversy these days with Sea World but we had a great day with our troop. Everyone was welcoming and nice.
1028,2/5/2013,3,"Seaworld is a glorified sea life zoo with a couple of attractions to keep the adults entertained. Maybe I'm just spoiled having grown up a few miles from Williamsburg, Virginia, but I've not found a theme park I enjoy more than Busch Gardens.If you're an adult travelling without kids, I'd think twice before visiting - or set your expectations appropriately as to stave off disappointment. I did enjoy the manta ride - I think I rode it about five or six times - being it was the only thrill ride in the park. If you come with kids, I bet they'd love all the sea life exhibits. The dolphin, penguin, and sea lion shows were fun; although, we missed shamoo on the day we were here - which probably added to my overall ""mehh"" experience. Apparently shamoo was only showing once that particular day and we didn't think about it until it was a tad too late.Word of warning, there's LOTS of people huddling around the edge of the pools during the dolphin shows, adults and kids alike. Get to these shows early and find a spot along the edge or you might miss being able to interact with the dolphins. During our trip in late August, there were a number of attractions that were closed, at least 15+ % of the park; which just added to my disappointments that day. Over all, I had a somewhat enjoyable day - Manta really 'coasted' in to save this one for me. I'm not sure I would come back, maybe if there were a fire sale on tickets and getting through the gate was more reasonably priced.Happy Yelping!"
1029,7/15/2017,5,I been coming to sea world since I was a kid. Â I love it and now I can share good times with my own kids. Dolphin and whale show has always been a must to see. I have the yearly membership and so blessed to have the park minutes away from are house. Would recommend to anyone visiting San diego.
1030,3/5/2015,1,"Caution: do not use the ""EZpay"" option with these crooks. Â When you sign-up for the 2 year pass, the line items you are to are for an upfront payment and then an auto-renewal amount for months 0-23. Â Naturally you have to agree to auto-renewal and you would think that is normal because you are agreeing to be charged each month. Â But what they don't tell you is that AFTER month 23 they will continue to charge you. Â And get this, the customer service rep ""Stephanie"" said that was as a guest courtesy. Â Know what you are getting into before clicking anything with SeaWorld, they appear to be proud of shady and deceitful business practices. Â I feel like Shamu just took a bite out of my @$$."
1031,7/13/2017,4,"It is one of the finest aquarium.Dolphin Show is a must watch.However, it is expensive. Hence, 4 star and not 5.You can park your vehicle across the street for free parking"
1032,4/23/2018,5,The experience was amazing and I loved the staff they were so helpful especially at the stadium I know sometimes I can be picky but the staff selling fruit cups let me choose and they all came to me without having me go down the stairs their prices were reasonable
1033,8/28/2015,5,So fun!!! No animals being mistreated only us baking in the California sun. Bought an umbrella for portable shade
1034,7/10/2017,4,"Seaworld advertised in papers, their website, and news Waves of Honor promotion was for Active Duty and Veterans. After unsuccessfully Â attempting for 3 days to apply as a Veteran for this promotion, called Seaworld and was told promotion only for Active Duty. This looks like misrepresentation and false advertisement. They should honor the Veterans as they have advertised. I have no plans of visiting Seaworld again.Update: Seaworld did fix the Veteran website and I was able to get 4 free promotional tickets. Â Seaworld is a classy organization afterall. Â Plan to visit soon."
1035,8/24/2015,3,"Came here with a good friend from high school and her husband on 5/30/15. We got the quick queue premier tickets so we could have prime seating at the events and not have to wait in line. We planned our day to see all the shows available, luckily we did a good job and did not feel rushed. 12:15pm Pet's Stadium-Pets Rule! This show was so adorable, all the animals were well trained and cute! A very fun show. Audience was able to pet the dogs after the show.3:30pm Cirque Stadium-Cirque de la Mer. The performers were so talanted! Cannot imagine how much work they put in. The show was funny and they included the audience in the show. Very impressive show!4:30pm Shamu Stadium-One Ocean. This show was more about how the oceans were connected and less about the orcas performing. It was cool to see orcas splash water on command.5:00pm Dolphin Stadium-Dolphin Days. Good show and dolphins well trained, wished they did more flips.6:15pm Sea lions and Otter Stadium-Sea Lions Live. The performers were entertaining and talented. The animals were so cute! Show was mostly by humans though.Overall, shows were a little disappointing for me because I thought there would be more tricks done by the animals... Maybe it's considered animal cruelty for them to perform so people perform instead?? Rides were good. We went on Manta, Riptide Rescue, Shipwreck Rapids, and Skytower. We ate at Calypso Bay Smokehouse and had Dippin Dots with the Shamu cups."
1036,2/22/2017,5,"We went to seaworld in 2015, and that is my first time to San Diego. We stay there just about two days. I love there, and I love sea animals. Sea world have some good shows of different sea animals such as orca show, sea lion show, and dolphin show. If I were you, I would buy ticket online first because it will save much time."
1037,7/6/2017,2,"I know this is a minor point, but I hate that the Sea World Tower is not fully lit this summer. Â I can see if from my house and it used to be a huge part of my summer. Â When the Tower was lit in all its Red, White and Blue finery, I knew summer had begun. Â Now it a big disappointment. Â Only one side has lights and it looks so odd from viewpoints all over Mission Bay. Â Come on, Sea World - turn on the lights!"
1038,2/8/2017,4,"Some very nice displays that allowed our grandson to get up close to the fish, and other animals. He had a really good time, and so did we. Felt open, and spacious. Noticed the holes for the stanchions for the waiting lines during high traffic seasons. Glad that we didn't go during the summer. Parking was decent at $17, but not a good idea for people to drive there individually. Dining options were decent. They are the masters of marketing with kiosks selling all kinds of stuff, all over the place."
1039,5/6/2015,4,I always have loved Seaworld! My 1st visit to the San Diego park. I know I know Sea world has takin a hit political backlash Â from the film blackfish which yes Â  I've Â seen however I had a great time! The park was clean and well kept. The trainers and staff excellent and the Orca show amazing! I got some great deals in the gift shop very reasonably Â priced! It was a perfect day Â and memory.
1040,11/2/2015,5,"Love this place especially the Pet's Rule Show and Manta. Went the day after Halloween. Â It was great..no lines or having to deal with a crowd at all. Little disappointed with the Shamu One World Show. Not really a show, just splashing people in the splash zone area. Still a good time. This was the first time I went to the Pet's Rule Show and it was Amazing!!!!. All the animals are rescued by SeaWorld and trained to do all sorts of tricks and amazing acts. Just amazing."
1041,10/20/2013,4,"what can you say about Sea World. Â The park, its theme, I had fun. Â I do have some recommendations though for those listening (yawn)...I had gone to eat (Shipwreck Reef), and of course the line(s) were long everywhere but I wasn't impressed with the food not being stored properly, it was just open for anyone to pick at their leisure. Â I know, its Sea World, but come on, how simple is it to have the food a short distance away from the customer and not endorsed by a heat lamp (cover it please). Â The customer service was eh, could be better, but you understand it's a theme park, and they've been on their feet all day. Â They get a pass, but smile, you're at Sea World... lolRides -- I had a pass, and I think I went on Manta at least 5 times. Â That ride is fast, and moves..I enjoyed Sea World, and will always be a fan of this place because Shamu is amazing and the training staff do much to put these shows on and give us all a smile..."
1042,7/4/2017,4,"This was my first visit to the park. It's very clean and the shoes are cute. They even have a pet show with dogs and cats and pigs! I was shocked at the ticket prices though. $95 per person! Kids were $85. We found out you can get tickets online for $60, so it worked out."
1043,12/5/2016,4,"Pricey touristy spot for kids, but worth it if you get their season pass. Yesterday, we paid $93 for their season pass. As an adult with no children, this place is good a few hours at a time. Luckily, the place is growing so there area always new features. Therefore, the season pass I got will be worth it when the new summer features come in."
1044,2/22/2017,1,Total waste of money! Extremely disappointing. Not sure what I expected but this was NOT it. Flamingo exhibit smelled so bad you couldn't breathe. Glass in exhibits was so dirty you couldn't see inside. Won't be going back. Barely spent an hour at this place. Vastly over priced. Don't waste your time and money.
1045,8/5/2015,3,"This place has changed since that documentary came out. The shows are not as fun as they were. Lots of PR. Food is still obviously expensive ($10 for chicken tenders and some not so good fries). Also, they serve Starbucks but don't take the gold card. However, it could be fun if you and your group plan your day, like the order of shows you're going to see. Also, a premiere pass lets you sit in the shaded area. Park itself is clean. Good job crew!Overall, fun for anyone who wants to geek out on sea lion trivia, penguins, beluga whales, etc.Tip: Sit in the bottom row at Cirque de la Mer. Most of the skit tends to be in the water. We couldn't see much because we were in the upper rows."
1046,1/13/2018,3,"It's been a very long time since I've been to Sea World. It has seemed iffy to me given the stories of animal treatment, or lack thereof, regarding their park and organization. But we visited today and I guess it was ok. We regularly go to both San Diego zoos and what we love about those parks is how informative and educational they are. Sea World lacks this. What we found the most were employees saying, ""you can poke this"" or ""you can feed that"". Nor were there many signs letting us know about species or the particular animal we were looking at. So that was a little disappointing. The arctic ride that resembles Star Tours at Disneyland was comical (which wasn't it's intention). It was very brief, showed us 2 seconds of footage for each animal on the ride and jostled us around a bit more. The rapids ride was pretty fun, though I think that's a hard ride to screw up. I think I got the worst of the wetness. You get a lot more wet on this particular ride than on Big Foot Rapids at Knotts Berry Farm. The food was surprisingly adequate for park food. We both ordered the ribs at the Ship Wreck Cafe (which has a very confusing set up by the way and no signs to direct you how to get through it). The ribs were actually pretty good and this is coming from someone who doesn't normally opt to eat ribs due to the mess. They also came with a side of criss cut fries which were well seasoned and a side of steamed, mixed vegetables. All in all I give the entire park 3 stars. The ribs and the rapids ride kind of saved it from a 2 star rating. While we did see most of the animals, we left not feeling like we learned anything of significance like we hope for. All we know is that we can touch certain things."
1047,3/18/2016,5,"We went there and watched the Shamu show. But I has just heard that they won't provide more shamu shows in the future, since they need to protect the shamus. So if you want to see the shamu shows, you'd better be hurry.The ticket is kind of expensive, but still worth to get there."
1048,1/20/2017,5,"I love this. To all the people that hate on sea world, I have suggestion. Why don't you all donate the necessary funds for all this animal rescue. Just saying.... probably have never given a dime."
1049,1/13/2011,2,"""Meh. I've experienced better."" is pretty much my exact experience here at Sea World.Maybe it has something to do with the change in programs as the years went by. I mean, I still remember my last visit...about 5 years ago with the awesome Shamu acts and the dolphin show was near perfection, but for this year...2010...it just got worse.It may also have something do with the recent death of a trainer and/or watching the documentary The Cove. I'm sure that documentary had some influence into the decision making here today. But really, the performances were not up to par. Why would someone pay 50 bucks to get in to see a mediocre show?Shamu - Not the same, no person in the water. No one sticking their head inside its mouth, no one doing the jump from Shamu's nose. Nothing....just a bunch of killer whales flapping around splashing water....whewwww cooool?!? Yah whatever.Dolphin show - again what happened? I mean there I can understand why they've degraded the Shamu exhibit, but c'mon...these are like harmless creatures. I don't understand the rationale of putting a Cirque du so layed piece into this show. I don't think its called a dolphin show anymore given that the dolphins were there for about 50% of the time and the rest were due to the diving, acrobatic, and other non-sense performers. What happened? It was so much better back then. No more jumping dolphins going up as high as 25-30 feet touching that ring above its head, no more coordinated dolphin jumps. It was replaced by people. So I recommend you guys changing the name to the Amateur Acrobats slash dolphin show because that is what I saw.Sea lion, sea otter show - The only thing entertaining about this piece is the dude who does the pre-show. He comes out and does a bit of routine, asks the audience for assistance and dances around doing bits from old movies, etc. He was actually pretty good. But once the show actually started, everything was off. The sea otter was just not doing its part, but you can't blame the sea otter. It was funny at first, but then became just sad at the end.I don't know...would I come back. Yah probably since they do have FREE admittance for military plus 3 dependents. Yah, just goto herosalute.com and just register for your free ticket. And pick up your free ticket at the will call. You're allowed 1 set of free tickets per calander year. So I guess, yah sure, I'll go back if its still free. And they do this every year. Parking is 12 bucks. I mean...c'mon...12 bucks...really? really? ahh whatever."
1050,12/27/2017,5,"We go to SeaWorld at least once a month - with and without kids it is a blast. Â With kids hit the rides early to avoid lines and plan shows for breaks. Â When we go as all adults we plan for shoes and walking and a nice lunch. Â It is clean, safe and easily walkable over a leisurely day. Â Avoid peak times in summer and school holidays if you don't want to wait in lines or want to avoid big crowds. Â It is a nice way to spend a day and nice to show off to our of town visitors."
1051,8/1/2015,5,This place is super awesome. Something for all ages. From infants to seniors. You can rap on rides or watch shows or info sessions. Pretty amazing.
1052,1/10/2016,5,"Fun day out for the family! Lots to see and do! Fun animal shows with killer whales, sea lions, dolphins, cats and dogs and so much more. Fun ""petting"" areas to touch sea life and soooo much learning all over the park. Few roller coaster rides for those who desire.. might get wet on those! Food seemed to be everywhere- lots of choices from healthy to junk food!"
1053,8/10/2015,4,"Every exhibit or show was wonderful...except one. Â The penguin exhibit is LAME...super dark, smelly, and the glass is so fogged up you can barely see anything! Â They need to update or get rid of that place! Â Otherwise we loved everything about our trip here! Â the rides are great for the kids, the shows are cute and funny. Â Lot's of people like sitting in the ""soak zone"" but then you smell like fishy pool water the rest of the day... so I'm not a big fan of it."
1054,12/31/2017,1,"Here today for a family friend outing, hoping things have changed. Â Yes, there are conservation efforts with Monterey Bay (sea otters). Â Place is outdated and the feeling is super sad here. Â The Orca Encounter is the most gravest area I have visited in the park. Â The older Orca was depressed with its curved fin, a sign of depression and or malnutrition, not swimming back and forth but was in the corner by itself. Â The smaller and younger orcas fins were up but they don't know any better as they were born into the park. Â The swimming pool that the Orcas were swimming in was just that - a swimming pool. If they took efforts to care for them like an aquarium, they would have other living sea creatures and sea plant life in it with them. Â Orcas just don't belong in a place for people attraction, in my opinion. Â This is a for-profit organization and are trying to rebound. Â I can see that they are trying but they can't sustain the infrastructure for long. Â It is an amusement park with rides, carnival, aquarium-ish, zoo and conservation. Â SeaWorld can't figure out their business right now. Â Trying to be too many things at once in such a compact area. Â Again, business can't sustain without a clear vision and mission."
1055,4/19/2017,5,Seaworld San Diego does such a great job educating about the animals they care for and rescue. Â  This program is so important for our coastal community and I'm so glad that we can still have such a great rescue program In this great city
1056,3/3/2015,4,"I really do love that we have places like SeaWorld to visit and take our kids to. While I really do think that places like SeaWorld should have coastal sanctuaries for their larger mammals, I understand that they may not have had the budget and government support to have made that a reality in the past. Maybe having PETA on their board will help speed the process along as opposed to disrupt progress with extreme and unrealistic demands.Either way, kids (and grown-ups) NEED places like SeaWorld. SeaWorld exposes us to so much and allows us to see and appreciate firsthand the intelligence, beauty and uniqueness of our magnificent sea creatures. I remember how much Sea World played a significant role in developing my childhood dream of becoming a marine biologist. Unlike normal aquariums, SeaWorld adds the element of human interaction, making us feel more connected to ocean life.I've been to this SeaWorld during Christmas holidays and weekends and it has never felt crowded. Hopefully that's just due to its size and the shows which attract a large majority of its visitors and not because of low attendance. I would be sad to see this place close.The 2015 pass costs the same as a one day ticket at $86 but does not include parking while the 2-year annual pass ($155) does."
1057,3/31/2015,3,"I recently went here on a Saturday at 11. It took forever to just pay for the parking, which was $16! Â You can get it for $15 if you buy it online. Â They have a self serve kiosk area where you can buy the tickets. AAA members get a small discount (like $5 off).Sea world in my opinion is going down hill. Â It's really hard to call it an amusement park. The shows are so much about education now. Â For best seating , you should arrive like 30 minutes before a show. It gets quite hot just sitting in one spot for 30-40 minutes. Exhibits are cool. The kids are able to do a lot of ""petting."" Â Food can get pricey but I love to eat at amusement parks. If you buy a drink in a souvenir cup, you get free refills the rest of the day."
1058,7/9/2017,4,"Nice rides, education Â and great shows. The park is so big. You will get wet. I recommend wearing flip flop, saddle and casual clothing. Also bring a towel and extra clothes."
1059,8/11/2015,5,"Schoolteacher had gotten a pair of tickets to Seaworld thanks to her being a Schoolteacher. Â On a Sunday morning, the park was full of people, but not uncomfortably so. We entered the park, and I got immediately got sidetracked by the first thing I saw. I decided to have some lil fish eat some skin off my hands. Whilst feeding the fish, there was a guy speaking about how to catch four shows in a row. Schoolteacher was paying attention, and when I was done with the fishes, she laid our our plan for the morning. Pointing to the map, she traced our path of shows. We were off. Â  Our first show was the dolphin show. We were spun a tale of a lonely girl dreaming out her window, and somehow she gets magically whisked away to a land where they have big people birds, playful dolphins, evil beluga whales (I think) and zany people diving. Then I think she gets whisked back to her window at the end. Okay, the plot here is kinda weird....but the animals and people were excellent, and highly entertaining. Â  The second show was the sea lion show. Where a very entertaining stage hand ends up leading a television channel that features Sea Lions and a lil otter. Again, very well coordinated, very entertaining, cute animals....and the stage hand was great. Â While waiting for the show to start, we hung out at the phone charger station, and we fed the sea lions out there. $5 gets you 5 fishies, but watch out for the birds, as they will steal the fish before they drop down to the sea lions. Schoolteacher had a big fish taken this way. Shortly afterwards, one of the animal trainers had his hawk in the area, and the fish-stealing birds didn't like the hawk. Â  Â  The third show was an extra weird 'cirque du' something or other show. Zero animals. People on high wires and ropes and jet skis and bouncy things. We were both pretty disappointed by this one. You can totally skip it. But hidden beneath this arena (by the bathrooms) they've got some cool animals on display, a giant squid, and some nautilesses. Â  The fourth show we saw was the Shamu show. That was great. Orcas splashing people, doin tricks. Splashy splash. Schoolteacher and I said from the start we didn't want to get splashed by fishy water, so we were up high in the stands the whole time. ""If you want to stay dryer, simply go a little higher"" was repeated to us at the beginning of several of the shows. I did get a kick out of a lone bird that hung out on top of the rotating screens. He stayed up there, just hoping to snag a fish when nobody was looking. Â  Â  Â  After the shows, we got our hands stamped, and left the park for lunch, we visited Chicken Charlie's Fry-B-Que just a few miles away. Â (It was tasty, check out my review) Â  Â  When we returned, we meandered the park and saw more of the animals. Penguins, Beluga whales, dolphins, rays, squids, and a plethora of other aquatic creatures. We also watched the pets show, where they have trained cats. I was pretty amazed at this. Who knew you could teach cats to do tricks? They've also got dogs and ducks and pigs. But those are all totally dumb trainable animals. But trained cats. Wow. Mind Blown. Â  We meandered the park for a few more hours, looking at the stores, going on the rides, and watching the animals. As it got dark, we went back to Shamu stadium, where we watched the night whale show. Man, photographing an orca in the daytime is hard enough. This show had it's own soundtrack, a friendly DJ playing tunes to warm the crowd up and kill time before and after the show, with lots of crowd participation, and ended the long day with a pretty fun display of fireworks. Â  Â They also do a great job of explaining what sea world does just beyond the dolphin and whale stuff. They're also a massive sealife rescue organization that's pretty effective. Â Aparently it's also a got a local brewery, since it is owned by Anheuser-Busch. I was kinda wondering why the beer giant distanced themselves from the park. (Last time I went it was right in the name of the park) I had an ice cold Michelob Ultra. I have to admit, after a long day walking around the park, that was one of the best beers I've had. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  All in all, it's quite a great place to go. Thank you dearest Schoolteacher for getting passes to make it happen."
1060,6/19/2017,1,"We just arrived from Utah. We were in line for the Manta and it broke down, then we went to the Sky Tower and it broke down also. From there we played the water gun game and only two guns worked and we are a family of four so that didn't work. We paid extra for front of the line passes but it doesn't do any good when everything is NOT working. Not impressed San Diego Sea World. Have you ever heard of preventive maintenance???"
1061,8/15/2015,5,"Spent the day at Sea World. Â Totally worth it. Bring sunscreen and sunglasses. Bring water. Plan on soft drinks and refreshments to be very expensive. We brought lunch with us in the car, and enjoyed it in our air conditioned car in the parking lot."
1062,7/28/2011,4,"I would like to start this review by saying I witnessed a fight the first two minutes I had walked into the park and to be honest I didn't expect anything better. The staff there didn't even care when I went to warn them, which disappointed me. I don't want that to effect the rest of the review though.I absolutely love SeaWorld. It's not my first choice when it comes to amusement/attraction parks, but I still enjoy it. One of my favorite shows is the Sea Lion and Otter show. It is HILARIOUS! The main guy Biff is almost fall off my seat funny, and I'm not going to lie, I'm definitely easily amused, but my boyfriend isn't and even he was laughing!My now new favorite show is the Dolphin Blue Horizons show. Apparently SeaWorld is going for more of an acrobatic/performer kind of approach and using the animals less, but I'm assuming because of the freak accident in Florida. Even though I really came for the animals, I still ended up enjoying it.I didn't give them five stars because they have the worst customer service, and I couldn't give them anything less than four because I absolutely love those animals."
1063,8/23/2015,5,"I had an amazing day seeing all the fish and animals. Â If you can I highly recommend the Dolphin Experience, which was the highlight of the day. Â The grounds are well kept and the staff are friendly and knowledgable. Â Wether you are a child or adult this is a place for all ages."
1064,3/2/2015,5,"Don't believe the PETA hype or the blackfish bs. These animals are well cared for and it's educational to see these beautiful creatures up close. Most born in captivity and could NOT survive in the wild, they are well fed and medically cared for. The park is amazing with lots of entertainment value. I recommend it to everyone"
1065,9/9/2015,3,"I was a bit hesitant to go here after watching the documentary ""Black Fish"", but it had been so long since I last visited when I was a kid, and I had gone to the San Diego zoo too much last year that I wanted to try something new. Luckily, I bought discounted tickets through my company (2 days for $62 after taxes/fees per person, and it doesn't have to be consecutive days). I went on the Sunday before Labor Day and didn't know what to expect-- would it be crowded because it was the long weekend, or would it still be dead because of Black Fish? I was surprised that it was actually kind of crowded. We arrived at least 10 min early for most of the shows and couldn't even get good seats. The shows were almost always packed. Like my friend had warned me, there were protestors as we drove into the park, which made me feel a bit guilty. Anyways, my group and I arrived around 10am and left around 7pm. We got to see almost all the exhibits and ride the all the rides, but the Journey to Atlantis ride died while we were in line (and the line was 45 min long!) :( I think we saw all the shows except the firework show. So yes, you definitely don't need to stay the whole time to see everything, but probably do need most of the day. The shows were good, but the trainers can no longer swim with the killer whales (probably because of Black Fish), so they weren't as impressive. It seemed like they were just splashing the audience and getting them very wet. It was still amazing to see the whales up close, since so few places have them. The dolphin show was cool though because the trainers swam with them and did tricks. I also liked the sea lion show. My favorite exhibits were probably the sea lions/ seals (we got to see them feeding), beluga whale exhibit, shamu underwater exhibit, the manta rays (we got to touch them), the shark encounter, penguins, and the aquarium with the giant octopus. These exhibits are a bit different than the zoo and I feel like you can get more up close and personal with them. But since Seaworld has been around for a while now, the entire park seemed a little old and worn down. The rides are new from when I last visited. Manta Ray roller coaster was pretty fun and we only had to wait 15 min. The Rapids ride got us soaked, since people can actually pay $.25 to shoot water at the ride passengers. You probably will get pretty wet throughout the day, so I'd recommend coming here on a hot day, or bringing a water proof jacket or an extra change of clothes.Like most amusement parks, the food here is mediocre and relatively expensive. However, there are some good options. We ended up eating at the Shipwreck Cafe and ordering the large salad (you can fill a container yourself and it's not by weight, so we ended up piling a bunch of salad for $10) and alfredo pasta with chicken tenders (I would pass this-- they barely gave us any chicken and it was $13). I'd probably opt to go to somewhere else next time, like the BBQ place, since the Shipwreck Cafe only gives chips instead of fries :P I love my fries.Anyways, it was a fun day but I would not pay the regular price $89 to come here again."
1066,5/26/2016,4,Had fun!!! Great shows & RidesFood too expensive.Bring a change of clothes; may get very wet during the dolphin show.........................
1067,5/12/2017,5,I love Seaworld so much! I'm an EZ Pay pass member and staff are always happy to help. Great food and fun rides and new attractions make this place a perfect vacation spot!
1068,4/15/2018,4,"This was a very fun place. Â It's not there same without the Shamu show. Â However, my aunt uses a walker and they had her walk all the twists and turns to simply enter the park. Â They should have had an entrance for the disabled. Â I participated in the Seven Seas Food Festival and was disappointed I had to walk to various stations throughout the park to try the foods. This means its hard to get to each station. Â I wasn't able to find them all. Â Yet, it was more disappointing when I discovered these samples weren't being made by an expert culinary team but teenagers (I not dissing the teens but one of my items wasn't made correctly but I didn't complain and chalked it off because she was young). Â The taste of these items were al'right. Â I also purchased the all day dining plan along with everybody else. Â So the wait in line to get my first meal took an hour and a half. Â This food was also al""right. Â Other than having terrible food the animal experiences where amazing."
1069,5/2/2015,5,"I love Sea world!. Been going since I was in girl scouts and went camping the first time back in the 90's. Shamu has been the thing of sea world. Â I love the shows and attractions. I love feeding the seals and sea lions; also the dolphins. Â They are sponsored by Anheuser Busch. Which is cool. A beer company that cares for mammals. You can buy beer there and walk around which was cool. There is only ONE spot and that's the front. If you want beer it's there only. Their beer is not cheep. No happy hour. If you're looking to ""drink"" you're in the wrong place. Anywho, Â That saved time having our drinks and walking to the Atlantis ride then staying there, we didn't have to finish our beer then walking there.... Â  Â  Â  Manta is a cool ride. Â When we got there it was ""the ride is having difficulties. If you wish to stay in line the ride may be up shortly. "" ......Waited 30 mins. We left,.... went some where else. Â Came back and was up. Â Great ride. . Short but hella fun. Unless you have been there Alot or went when they open. It's a 2 day thing. They had last year buy a day get a day. We did 2 days. You pay parking each time $20 big bucks but when we went we told her it's my hubby's birthday. She waved us in. Â Told him happy birthday...OMG! Â That was soo nice of her. ... They are great with birthdays. Â My opinion.... We went in and got my hubby a birthday button. . They don't do buttons....... It's stickers. .:( Â  WTH..?. ..BUT.... Knotts, Disneyland and Magic Mountain do buttons. .... come on. !.... Fine he got a bracelet like if he was entering a club signed to him and a sticker. Â Though when he walked threw the park he got ""Happy Birthday"".!!. That was so cool. . Either it was every where he went from the crew or just random customers. . They treat birthday people awesome. So that sticker ment more then the button. . Â No discounts but that's OK ........The acknowledgment was just as good. . We went to see the sea lions and otters. Â We bought fish to feed them. Â We got..... I think 3 or 4 fish. Â I wanted to take pictures of my hubby. He was Sooooo excited he feed them. I told him ""I told you wait so I can take pictures"".. where's your fish? . They were gone. I'm not going to lie. .I was upset. We don't do this often and I wanted to capture the moment and it was over. ..:(. .. I told him well let's buy more. . They weren't cheep and birds steal them from you which did happen to my hubby. Anywho, they were closing and a lady gave him free fish and told him happy birthday. ..omg that was soooooooooooo awesome. Â I got those pictures I wanted for him and he got to feed the seals again. That was a blessing. Each show like Shamu I wanted to cry in joy. Â The show keeps you going from start to finish. Â You get wet. Â Winter, spring, summer, fall no matter. If you don't want to get wet. Â Stay out of the wet zone. Â Simple. ........I love the sky ride... you see lots of San Diego. You can't walk around but it rotates so you don't miss anything. Â They have I think it's a sky lift I'm sure I'm wrong but it's a ride in the air on a wire from one side of the park to the other. You're over the river or lake. It's cool too. They have many things that's why I think if you're not there when it opens. A 2 day pass is great. You Miss Nothing. They give you a map. Â What we do is, if we went there we cross it off with a pen or if no pen we rip a small hole over where we went. Â Prices are a not cheap. You can leave the park so bring a lunch in the car. Â We hid sandwiches to bring inside. I want money for souvenirs not food. Just saying. They do bag search so don't bringing all kinds of stuff to be obvious. bring bottle water because it's Alot of walking. Â Overall I loved my visit there. I don't want to believe they are abusive to the animals. I'm not a person to belive the media. Â All I know is I believe in God and don't mess with God's creatures. Â ""Do unto others as you would have done unto you""..That applies to animals too. Doesn't say humans only. .I can't vouche for what's happening at Sea World. It's NOT on media that they are doing something wrong. I love this place. It's great for all ages at least once. Unless it's proof they are miss treating they're animals. I back Sea World 100000000000%(1 hundred million percent). I studied for Marine Bio and Sea World seems to care for their creatures. ... RL"
1070,2/8/2017,3,"Interesting opportunity to see sea life up close, e.g. Orca killer whales, dolphins, penguins, etc. Without Shamu show, Sea World magic is not quite the same. That dolphin show is now number 1 in Sea World says a lot."
1071,2/1/2018,1,Visited recently the past weekend Jan 2018. Horrible experience. Kids were bored as hell. Sea world is old and needed updating Not al lot of varieties of spices display. Aquarium is small an fish tank looks empty. Shows are far apart to wait. Left SW disappointed. Make sure request refund within 2 hours.
1072,7/12/2015,5,"We had a sleep over as a part of the sea world camp program with our Girl Scout troop. It was such an amazing experience! We got private tours of different exhibits, fun activities, got to feed the sting rays and sea lions and also got to sleep in the turtle reef aquarium! We all had such a great time! We also bought a wrist band for our meal, a definite must!! It's all you can eat at four different restaurants throughout the park and those places were really good! Especially the cafe where you can make your own burger.... I had the chickpea burger, it was delicious!! We had such a great time! Lots of great memories!!"
1073,10/11/2014,1,"What's up, SeaWorld!How are you, I haven't seen you years! Well, I wouldn't know, because I COULDN'T GET IN WITH MY FREE TICKET FROM WORK being a Registered Nurse :D. We waited about 3 hours getting shuffled from line to line because of your incompetent staff being ""overwhelmed"" with the ""swarms"" of people coming in during the weekend.I loved the fact that most people I saw had the same papers and were told to go to one place which would lead to another long line which would take another hour... only to be told that ""Oh, it's only for EMS today, sorry."" Really. Where on this ticket says EMS today only? When did you decide to have us drive an hour 30 to get to this ocean paradise? When did you decide to waste and ruin my day?!I also liked how families were led by a staff member, one family at a time, over and over... have common sense. Be efficient. Or maybe your memory span is only 3 seconds long.My advice to you, SeaWorld, is to make a sign or an announcement using the intercom, a conch or Shamu's cries to let everyone know AHEAD OF TIME, BEFORE YOU PAY 16 DOLLARS PARKING, THAT WE ARE ONLY LETTING EMS IN TODAY, SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE, GO HOME AND SLEEP SO YOU WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, THANKS.They told us that we can get in for 50% off the ticket price, which is 42 dollars. If you can refund 3 hours of my time wasted then that'd be great. We asked for a refund for parking so they directed us to the exit area of the parking lot. A lot of angry folks were already there. We got our money back and drove back home.Are you squidding me."
1074,8/10/2018,1,"A truly horrible place and a complete waste of money. Â It's capitalism run wild - a combination of a water themed outdoor mall selling Chinese made aquatically themed toys (that kids like for 5 -10 minutes and then move on) and a massively overpriced foot court ($9.15 for a hot dog, I kid you not) selling unhealthy food. Â Oh, and there are some dolphins and killer whales, which are great, but not easy to find, because, again, you are in a foodcourt/mall. Â The rides are only so-so, yet the lines to get on them are truly magnificent. Â 90 minutes for a 3 minutes ride? Â Yes, you can pay some extra $ to cut the line, but this leads me back to capitalism run amok argument. Â The entire place is designed to suck every last dollar out of your wallet before you leave the gate. Â Do your kids and your sanity a favor and go to a non-profit attraction instead - a local zoo or natural history museum. Â You and your kids will have a better time and learn more, you can leave with your soul intact, and it will cost half the price. Â And what you do spend will not go towards lining the pockets of corporate execs."
1075,4/25/2013,4,"I used to love this place as a kid, and haven't been here probably in several decades. Â Took my kids and with this trip being their first time, they loved it! Â They've renovated a large portion of the park, with some renovations still under way. Â Some of the exhibits - like the aquarium ones where you walk through, do feel like they haven't been updated since I was there as a child. Â They felt humid, and a little gross overall. Â However, the newer exhibits (like the Arctic one) was clean and designed well for walking through. Â The popular performance shows (Shamu and also the dolphin one) would require waiting in line about 30 minutes before actual show time to get a good seat. Â The park also has a little play area where there are rides for the little ones. Â My younger child really enjoyed that, because the lines weren't long and the rides were cute and simple, perfect for the 2-4 year old age group. Â The area next to that also has carnival games where you can win prizes like stuffed animals - the only downside is that the carnival games aren't included with the price of admission. Â It's an extra $5 for 3 balls or $3 to play a round. Â Not bad considering you can win a stuffed animal for $5 versus paying $15 for a stuffed animal at one of their concession stands."
1076,12/9/2014,5,"We got the SD go pass and sea world has been our favorite attraction so far. For anyone interested, the dog kennels worked great for us. I couldn't find much info searching online so I'll post some extra details here. When you drive up to the parking lot entry pay kiosk you can pay the $10 kennel fee then and they will direct you to the kennels just 100yds to the left of the parking lot kiosk. They are well covered but bring a pad or blanket, they are just concrete floors. Leave a bowl for water, its a bit of a hike to get there by walking from the park entry.  Â  The park was very clean and every team member was very friendly. Were considering going back once more before we head home."
1077,9/9/2015,2,": ) Â LIKE Â : )* It is a tourists' point-of-interest: ( Â NOT Â : (* The Zoo package deal: 3-for-1 ticket at Costco (SD Zoo + Animal Park + Seaworld) is a bleepin' pain-in-the ass; tickets that were scanned, at the gate, are being responded with ""Invalid Tickets"" * The Zoo's focus is on selling tickets. customer care is an after-thoughtOnly after being denied entrance for having ""invalid tickets"", the supervisors at the parks realized that the databases for the three parks are still being maintained separately; such that the 3-for-1 tickets are being recognized as invalid tickets. Â WTF!!?? Â If the parks want patronage and business, one of the basics is to be sure that the tickets (which I spent $500 for a family of four) is valid at all locations.The parks are supposed to be tourist attractions, NOT tourists distractions! Â Fix your damn databases!"
1078,10/9/2016,4,"Returned for my second visit and was pleasantly surprised. I never tried the Pets rules show but that was a great one if you love the furry animals. You could pay $5 extra for premiere parking which is a definitely recommendation after hours of walking around the park. Also, the main event, Shamu show, announced a change coming soon in 2017 to redesign the show as a more ""natural"" setting for the whales. Looks like another consumerism ploy to me! But that's just my skepticism. This place is kid friendly and stroller friendly. Lots of crowds on the weekend but no long waits except for the rides. My favorite is the Sea Lion show with Biff the showman. Pretty entertaining stuff for all crowds."
1079,4/6/2016,5,We love sea world . This is our second time bringing the kids . We figured we better come see the whales one last time . We've noticed it's become do politically correct that even though every show is great they have to practically give commercials to prove they are helping save animals . I definitely can say Sea World does way more good then bad maybe my personal opinion . Anyways they get my 5 stars
1080,6/22/2015,3,"Saw a few new additions since visiting more than 10 years ago. Generally, pretty clean. Not a lot of shaded food tables to hang out/eat at which is a bad thing in the summer. We had lunch at Calypso Bay. Brisket was salty and so was the bbq sauce which is kept outside of the food area. When I requested help to bring my food trays to my table, everybody acted like I asked for their first born. Nobody wanted to help me. Finally, one of the servers carried my tray to the cashier and asked someone else to help me carry it out to my table. Very rude staff here. Not so family-friendly... Will not be returning."
1081,12/6/2015,4,"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to go to SeaWorld. Today was finally the day and we spent the entire day there! There were a lot of people but not too many that you couldn't move around. We watched four shows: the dolphins (got drenched!), the orca whales (educational) , the sea lions (hilarious!) and the Pets Rule! show ( so cute!). I also enjoyed the Cleaner Fish; put your hand in the warm shallow water, keep very still and the fish will nibble on your hand! It tickles! The gandola was fun and we even got a photo of us on it (you have to pay for it but its good quality). The food here was just okay, but the sampler platter we got from Calypso Bay Smokehouse was pretty good! The sampler platter had sausage, chicken and ribs. We had a really good time, however. . .I didn't like seeing Peanut the Beaver locked up in a small room all by herself! There were no other beavers with her! The poor critter was standing alone against a wall, rubbing her tummy. :0("
1082,6/29/2015,3,"Sea World is a nice, family oriented facility where you will see lots of marine animals you would never have the ability to see ordinarily. However, Sea World needs to be more TRANSPARENT with it's pricing. On the website it's 50 dollars M-F, but if you arrive without an online purchase it's something ludacris above 80 dollars. Why on either would a company have two separate pricing for online vs. physical purchase ticket unless they wanted to scam people?Sea World: you have a beautiful facility and your shows are amazing. Please be more transparent with pricing and charge one consistent fee."
1083,2/28/2016,4,"It's better than the last time I remembered it. We bought the fun pass for $79 per person. They also had a promotion for preschoolers. As long as the child is 5 or under, they can get a fun card for free before March 20th. So, with saving money from not having to purchase an extra fun card for my little one, I got myself the annual pass with parking. A couple of fun passes @ $79, an annual pass with parking for $155, and a free child's fun card for less than $320 for the year? Wow... That's a great deal we couldn't pass up! Â So we went, and...Yay! Â The kids had a lot of fun. The shows are funny. I especially enjoyed the Pets Rule show, even though it hasn't really changed much over the years. Most of the animals were saved from shelters and trained to do amazing things. Sea World gave them second chances in life. The Sea lion show is really adorable, too. The Dolphin Stadium is under maintenance, so we didn't get to see that. However, there is Dolphin Point where you can still see the dolphins and listen to the trainers talk about them.Penguins, sea turtles, sharks, and more are available for viewing. Very educational. The restrooms (we arrived late in the day around 2:30pm) were surprisingly very clean. Disneyland is always awesome, but since it's been so crowded lately, the restrooms have always been disgusting. So, Sea World's restrooms were Â a nice in comparison! The touching pools near the entrance were great. We loved listening to the information they would give us about the animals in the pool. For a Saturday, it wasn't as crowded as I expected the place to be. Can't wait to come back to learn more about the animals. Great educational family fun!"
1084,1/6/2013,5,"I came here for my birthday and it was a blast! We were there at 11am and left at 5.30pm. Time goes by really fast when you are having fun and I had fun. The Shamu Show was fantastic. It's always fun to watch people get wet when splashed and I'm pretty sure the water was freezing cold! The Dolphin Show was fun too, although I wished there were more dolphin time on the show rather than the people doing acrobats but overall it was a fun experience. We bought the Wild Arctic Tour at 3.15pm and that was the best part of the trip. We got to feed Obie the great big walrus and touch his whiskers. Boy! Obie was huge! 3000 pounds and apparently he is not that big compared to the others. The normal size for a walrus in the wild goes up to 5000lbs!! He was a big adorable cutie and feeding him fish and getting to interact with him was super fun!We also had a close encounter with two beluga whales. Fed them and was given the opportunity to touch them and feel the blubber memory-foam like body. All the animals are adorable and it appears that they do like all the human interaction. But that's just my opinion. The tour ended with a back room view of the polar bear. We were informed that even the trainers are never in the same space as a polar bear as these animals are predators! Just imagine, the polar bear has been known to feed on beluga whales and walruses and it is easily twice or more it's size!I highly recommend Seaworld and the tours! Don't miss the shows and if you have some extra dough, certainly go for the tours! The food selection isn't that great. By the time you walk around the park, you get tired, everything looks good. The food was expensive but it's not worth the price you pay outside."
1085,3/29/2016,4,"Seaworld is a must visit spot if you are in San Diego. Its pretty pricey though with an admission fee of $69 if you purchased it online. If you purchase it at the gate, you are looking at $89. The Shamu show was awesome! Really great information about killer whales tied into the awesome show. I didn't realize how smart and well trained the whales was. Â It lasted about 15 mins but it sure was worth it. The food was a little on the pricey side but hey..yolo!"
1086,9/20/2015,3,"The shows are great yet, they are now very short. We must have sat longer before than what shows lasted for. We walked around and got on the rides twice because the lines were not as long. We also got front of the line passes we used for rides that had longer lines. We would come again though."
1087,5/11/2015,5,"Really enjoyed it! Some friends gave us some passes for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a lot of fun. I love the mixture of things to do. Want to look at animals all day? Do it! Want to see some shows? Do it! Want to ride some really fun rides - do it! The lines were not long at all for anything the day we went, and the Manta ride is the best. I would venture to guess the lines will be worse once it hits summer and the tourists REALLY come out, but I enjoyed myself. The food quality when you get the all day dining passes isn't bad either! Go to Mama Stella's towards Manta for some great pasta, and the restaurant towards the front of the park that has burgers is very good, as well."
1088,9/22/2014,1,"It was with deep regret that I have to disapprove of my experience at San Diego Sea World. The day started with my niece, nephew, and daughter being revved up and excited about their day at Sea World. Dolphins! They said! On the car ride up, all they could talk about were the different sea life animals that they were going to see. It worked out in our favor that we got free tickets to Sea World for being a first responder for the recent wild fires. Oh so we thought.We got to the parking lot, paid our $16, then proceeded to the entrance with our printed out tickets. They then said we had to ""redeem"" our tickets in a different line. We came to that aforementioned line and it was about 2 hours deep at 1030am, 30 min after park opening. After waiting in the heat, it turns out that we, as hospital workers, did not qualify for these free tickets. Packs of people became more and more frustrated as they found out this information only after hours of waiting. Myself included. After the employee checking our work badges told us that we didn't qualify, he told us that we would be eligible for 20% off all tickets today. I asked specifically, ""does that Sea World fun card count?"". He said yes.OK. So fine. The kids are here, they have this expectation that they're going to see dolphins, Sea World had lured us in and made us pay for tickets, we couldn't let the kids down. So I waited another 1.5 hours to purchase tickets. When I approached the ticket counter, I said that I wanted to get the fun card passes at 20% off, as was mentioned to me before. ""I'm sorry ma'am but we can't give you 20% off the fun card. It only applies to the regular tickets"". As much as I reiterated that an employee had told me the contrary, it turns out that we were misinformed again. Again. We forked up the money, went to Sea World, tried to hide our frustrations from the kids and went on with our day. Over $200 unexpected costs, over 2 hours of waiting in the heat. What a disorganized, miscommunicated, unappreciated mess. I tried to overlook the Black Fish documentary, but this terrible customer experience made me look away from Sea World even more. Sea World, there has to be something you can do to make up for this.Side note, after checking the Sea World free tickets website again they had added ""hospital workers, including nurses, are not eligible"". I checked through and through prior to booking the tickets and no such line existed before. Would have been nice to recognize these workers. And if not, would have been nice that you had been more clear before adding this line in."
1089,9/13/2014,1,"So only reason why i came here was because my mom got free tickets.. It was so weird being here! Havent been here in years & i see the change! Its not as packed as how it used to be.. Lots of walking involved because everything is so far from eachother.. U will need a map!! I think the most favorite part of sea world is the atlantis ride!! My mom enjoyed it.. But about that ride, it always has issues daily! Thats what the ppl said too that worked there cuz when we were in line it stopped out of no where and had to wait longer. Also its very hard seeing all the animals just stuck there for life.. My heart dropped when i saw the penguins :(I didnt go to any of the shows because ever since i saw blackfish, i had such a change of heart.. I never want to support their shows ever again!"
1090,11/24/2014,5,"I went to SeaWorld this past weekend for their Christmas celebration. To put it simple, it was fantastic! At night the entire park was covered with beautiful Christmas lights of many colors, and Christmas music was everywhere. Likewise, SeaWorld did an amazing job with Snow World, which is a fun little place to throw snowballs and play around in some snow.The best part for me was seeing Santa's Village, It was great having a Christmas oriented place that sold pies, hot chocolate, and was covered with decorations. It was so worth it !SeaWorld was more decorated than Disneyland!"
1091,3/5/2015,5,"It is a fantastic park ! The nature in the park, the cool rides, the shows with the Dolphins, sea otters, pets, see lions and of cours Shamu the Killer Wale :-) i loved avrything about the park. And of you go outside the bussy season it is great to be here. Easy close by parking. The lines at the rides are al within 5minutes. Parking normally costs 16$ but it was free today, because it was not busy. Great !"
1092,8/29/2013,4,"The shows were excellent. Â As expected, it was pretty crowded for a summer Saturday. Â Everything is pretty expensive, but not ridiculous. The huge funnel cake with two large scoops of ice cream was $9 and the chickpea guacamole burger meal was about the same, and both were delicious. Â I was afraid the food would be as terrible as Disneyland.Definitely stay for the Shamu show which starts at 8pm. Â We will return in a year or two. Â Hopefully PETA will not have shut it down by then."
1093,4/3/2016,4,"It has been my 5th time coming here. Never disappointed, just don't like comimg cause all the controversy and I feel bad for all the animals. It was the first time bringing my boyfriend and he was so happy. I'm glad he came and brought him here. Food was delicious and it was very nice weather"
1094,12/4/2015,5,"If you can, go on a weekday. Its less packed. Food and drinks are always expensive but you are allowed to bring water into the park. I brought my camel back in. They do have free military and up to three dependents once a year . they have ton of sea creatures and tons to see and touch. Its just a bit sad watching the whales after the documentary black fish."
1095,12/26/2017,1,"We had a bad experience at Sea World. Â Will never go back again. Â We went on the Christmas day. Â The experience at the ""Sea Lion and Otter"" show was bad. Â The first show was at 1:15 PM and we reached a few minutes early and the show was full. Â Fair enough, it's a holiday. Â The next show was at 3:15 PM and we reached around 10 minutes earlier this time. Â Guess what! Â The staff said that the show was full. Â We left and a few seconds after we left, we saw that the same staff was letting in hoards of people while we were denied entry on the grounds that the show was full. Â So we headed back to stand in line again. Â Just when we reached, the staff said that the show was full. Â So yet again, we were denied entry. Â We explained our situation but the rude person was not willing to listen. Â In fact, he was borderline condescending to the other people too. Â After this experience, we left Sea world at 3 PM and took a pledge to never come back again."
1096,12/20/2016,4,"We love this place!! Always have the annual passes every year every since we moved down to San Diego (7 years ago) now that we have two kids, we love it even more. It is pricey for food and they increased their drink refills from $1 to $2. Other than that, we're always there for the shows and Sesame Streets play area and rides."
1097,1/27/2017,3,"Seaworld is a place to go to if your in the area BUT compared to all other attractions in California I gave this a 3. It was not very organized at all. We didn't know where the ticket line was and the lines to get into the park were very slow and overlapping. Â It took us over 35 minutes to enter. The lines to get food was even worse. We waited an hour to get food and it was horrible! If you want to see the shows, try to be at each one at least 30 minutes prior or you won't be able to get in or get a good seat. The rollercoaster was fun! Unless you have children, I wouldn't recommend it as my first choice."
1098,9/15/2017,5,"I've almost forgotten to write about one of SDiego's premier tourist and local family attractions. Like our beaches, this park is fantastic. The care they show for these mamals is much greater than what you read or hear about in the news. Sure, they're in a confined space compared to the open waters, but they are well fed, looked after medically and are visited by a half million people each year. Look, places like this, football stadiums, baseball stadiums and other exhibits wouldn't exist if humans didn't have a driven need for them. If no one went, I doubt any of these things would exist for people's entertainment. We spend a lot of money these days watching overpaid sissy's play a game, but complain about what it costs to see some of the worlds greatest living aquatic creations. Maintaining aquariums and zoo's cost a lot of money, so if we want to keep these attractions, then it's a small price to pay for their existence. I, for one, don't like the cost of tickets for a family of four or six, but to see the joy on my kids, and now my grandkids faces - ""priceless"", don't you think?"
1099,3/30/2017,5,"Best theme park in So Cal - Disney included. Â There are only two bigger sized roller coasters, however the wait times are about 10 to 15 minutes tops to ride. Â The grouds are beautiful and the interactive animal petting and feeding pools are amazing. My son said it is the most fun thing he has ever don in his short 12 years. Â And he has done alot and traveled ALOT. Â It is super fun and beautiful."
1100,4/4/2018,3,I recently went there with my seven year old nephew. Â We enjoyed seeing the animals but SeaWorld seemed to have lost some of it's appeal. Â The orca show is now mostly a screen display. Â He was expecting more interaction with the orcas. He liked walking around and seeing the various animals more than the shows. Â I added the all day dining for both of us when I ordered online. Â It cost $20 extra per person for ages 3+. Â It saved money for my ticket and dining but not for his. Â A child's dining is only $18.99 when purchased separately - not a big difference but it's the principle. The all day dining plan is accepted only at some Â locations and for limited items. Â The lines at these locations took a long time Â - some even 60+ minutes and only a few options for the kid's choice menu. Â I would not purchase the dining plan if I were to visit again.
1101,4/11/2017,3,I give it a 3 because there weren't many attractions anymore like I remembered it to be. There was no Shamu or animal shows showing a lot. Â Then they had a malfunction where the Wild arctic and Atlantis ride were having technical difficulties. But we had fun on the mantra and the Atlantis ride once it was up and running again.
1102,8/21/2013,3,"They don't let you feed the dolphins anymore!!! :'( I was so sad...I went for my birthday looking forward to feeding them but was disappointed. I think because of that incident where one of the dolphins bit a little girl. You can still feed the Sea Lions and Sting Rays though. Other disappointment, we were looking forward to seeing jellyfishes, but there were none! We asked a worker what happened to them and she said their tank kept overfilling so they got rid of them :( BOO. Â SIgh, so at least let the Shamu show be good? It was ok, but they don't go in the water with the whales anymore!! I remember when I was a kid and seeing the trainer be shot up on the whale just blew my mind and now I'm sad I probably won't ever see that again. Again, I know it's probably a safety issue after a whale pulled a trainer down before. HOWEVER, there was a baby whale!! IT WAS SO CUTE. It would randomly do flips and follow it's mom throughout the whole show! The new ride Manta didn't look too thrilling but boy, let me tell you, that ride will surprise you!! It jets you outta there with lots of drops and turns. I love roller-coasters but I'm prone to motion sickness and felt Â queasy after. I probably won't ride it again but it was definitely fun. Â Journey to Atlantis is my favorite. If you've never been on it before, I don't want to spoil it for you but the first time I ever went on it I was flabbergasted. You would think the drop happens at the end but it's in the beginning, I thought it was a roller coaster?! Â Then whoa!! I also LOVE using up all my quarters and firing the water canons at people haha. If you go on the weekends during peak times expect crowds. Try lining up early for shows as they will meet full capacity up to 20 minutes before the show even starts. People line up an hour before shows start, OR find a side entrance and a nice employee ;) Â We got into a few shows without lining up that way, we weren't even trying to avoid the lines or cut we just genuinely didn't know where to go and got in!Food can be expensive so be prepared for that or bring your own lunches. Also if you're staying late bring jackets as it gets really cold with the ocean breeze. SeaWorld is still a great place to go. Although the new changes made me sad and miss what I remembered seeing as a child, it still has it's perks. For people who have never been before I recommend going as you'll be blown away with all the amazing tricks the sea animals can do. If you have been before but years ago, don't have high expectations as a lot has changed."
1103,12/7/2014,5,"Ever since 2006 Sea World has inspired me care and cherish our world in a whole new way. It has breath taking shows, thrilling rides, and one of a kind animal exhibits. This theme park is highly recommended for children of all ages. Every trip is a new adventure with new memories and moments to cherish. SeaWorld is truly a place ""Where Worlds Connect"""
1104,10/23/2016,5,The lines arent thay bad but when you want to see shows you do have to find good seats and get there early. The food tastes like cafeteria food but overall it was great.
1105,8/12/2016,5,"Sea word is the best park to go in San Diego is super clean, all the workers there are nice and they have the best deals went you buy online! A good place to be for the weekend"
1106,3/4/2015,1,It's not worth the money.. don't come here in a weekday for now.. lots of the attraction are close..
1107,1/14/2018,5,"We went on an empty Friday, all but two rides were open so that was a little disappointing. But you got to interact with many animals there which was really fun! I paid $180(sale price) and got to interact with dolphins in the water. I was given underwear and a wetsuit. It was a lot of fun and the dolphins were so sweet, perfect creatures. At the end I got to take a souvenir towel home, but I had to pay $35 for 2 photos that the photographer took. With the amount of money spent on the actual Dolphin encounter, one photo for free would have been really nice. Enjoyed my time at SeaWorld, the Dolphins made my trip worth it all."
1108,4/25/2017,5,"My family visited Sea World today after not having been here for over 12 years. We had a great time and enjoyed all the shows and exhibits. The dolphin show was amazing, the sea lion show was hilarious and the killer whales were awesome. Despite all the protests you can tell these animals are well cared for and the trainers care deeply about them. Yes the food is expensive and so so but that's a typical theme park. The midweek price is a great deal for a full day of fun"
1109,6/2/2016,1,"SeaWorld allowed my Orbit Baby G3 stroller to be stolen. Â They made me a victim to a predator. SeaWorld San Diego security guards/police offices cannot review video footage in the park in case of an emergency. In my emergency, they didn't act quickly. I knew within 20 minutes of the theft because, I left the pet show early and my stroller was stolen. They didn't notify the only entrance or exit of the emergency that was happening. They made me wait for a supervisor and then said, I had to ""be escorted to lost and found."" I said, my ""stroller isn't lost it was stolen I need to go to the security office"" but, was told there isn't one. What?! There isn't a security office you can go to in SeaWorld?  Â  Â  SeaWorld doesn't allow you to keep your valuables with you at all times. I have learned through my experience that they don't have proper realistic protocols on how to alert the public that an item of yours has been stolen or lost. This place gives you a false feeling that you are safe and being monitored, when in reality they are not looking out for your family's safety. Every time I asked them to look at the cameras they would say they aren't allowed and that is another person's job in another department. When they finally gave me his number it kept going to voice mail and it took five days for his assistant to call me back. There should be a security assistant or monitor at least while the park is open. I even waited at the front gate until the end of the day to get an image of the thief and I filed a police report. The security officers did not have access to the cameras to give me the picture of the thief. Â  Â  It broke my heart to see my two year old son asking strangers over and over if they saw his stolen stroller. My child has been traumatized from this experience. Had SeaWorld made more of an effort I would have my stroller back. SeaWorld is saying they can't reimburse us for it because, it is company policy. Well, if your company had better protocol I wouldn't be a victim to grand theft. This happened to me and I want them to correct their mistakes and reimburse me and not allow any other parent to experience this. We are consumers and have the right to know about our safety at SeaWorld and they need to do a better job for their patrons personal belonging. This is unacceptable business practice. Predictors clearly know this is a place they are able to use to steal from us."
1110,6/18/2013,4,"Oh Sea World... how entertaining you can be to a couple twenty something year olds. Came here around noon and still had time to go to all the shows, all the rides, and exhibits and stretched out our 6 hour stay. Shows: Sea lion, Blue Horizons, Pets Rule and Shamu. Since I went in May, not many kids were out of school yet so even last minute, I was able to find a seat in the front (though there was only two of us... makes it a lot easier!) All shows were really cute and entertaining and had a lot going on. They have pretty good story lines and pleases all ages. FYI: even if you sit it the splash zone, you MAY not get splashed, but when you do, oh boy... better buy your dolphin towels and ponchos! Rides: A roller coaster, atlantis (the water ride), ship wreak (another water one in the river) and a 3-D one. Maybe since I'm older now, its not as scary as I thought but I think I was just about the only one screaming my lungs out. They also have many exhibits you can visit such as reptiles (shudder), penguin, dolphins, etc. They're all relatively small but worth a visit. Overall, like my sis Sophia Y. mentioned, its a place you visit at least once while you're in San Diego and just make the best of it! It was a good time, but pretty freaking expensive, especially since it only takes about half a day to do everything."
1111,12/18/2016,4,"It's a good place to visit . They need to update and add new stuff, more activity for the kids . Other than that the place is really clean they have nice people work there ......"
1112,9/21/2014,1,"If you are going to grant free entrance and let registered nurses qualify as first responders last month, you should be consistent on your definition throughout the complimentary tribute period, and grant other registered nurses entrance on the last day as well!My nurse colleagues qualified last month, but I was rejected on Saturday after I waited 3 hours in line! Â It is confusing and unprofessional, especially for an organization that prides itself on giving back to the community with this program.Not even a trauma nurse, who is a first responder with an EMT, can qualify for this definition.Unbelievable."
1113,4/20/2017,4,Lots of fun and they treat our military people right. My son is a Marine and he was able to get in free. The even had the entire park stand to the National Anthem before opening the park. We will return! God bless all who serve!
1114,12/2/2015,4,"I've only ever really heard about Sea World and was fortunate enough to experience it this year. The park is huge! It was very enjoyable to walk around and find different places and events to watch. My boyfriend and were able to watch the Shamu show, the Seal show and the Dolphin show. Out of all the three shows I enjoyed watching the Seal show the most! It was funny, interactive and the people working with the animals were hilarious! We also found that there were a lot of vendors as we walked around the park and vendors selling drinks and food during the shows. I loved riding the air tram! It gave you a good view of the park and Fiesta Beach. The food that we got was decent, but like all parks are very much overly priced. We also went into the different gift shops and were able to find some items for a good deal. My experience here was fun and I enjoyed the different attractions here."
1115,9/27/2015,5,Great educational and fun day for our 6 year old. Staff was awesome. Love this place. We support seaworld and all they've done to help the ocean and save lives.
1116,6/29/2016,1,"It's hard to navigate the park because of terrible signage, everything is overpriced, and we dealt with more than a couple rude employees. More importantly, the animals seem so depressed. There are so many other things to do in San Diego that don't involve torturing animals. I'll never go back and neither will my children."
1117,9/21/2014,2,"Miserable first few hours. Â good tip: BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE!! My mom got 4 free tickets because of a special Sea World was having for"" wildfire tribute."" Just to get in to Sea World to find parking, Â we waited 1 hour in a long line of cars. Very disorganized. Then, We had to go through the tickets and reservations line. We spent nearly 3 hours in line just to get tickets. Â It was so miserable. . People were getting discouraged and complaining not to mention it was scorching hot. Finally got our tickets and we had to basically rush to do everything because we only had 4 1/2 hours left till the park closed. We didn't get to see everything.. was really bummed.. but the rides were awesome. Definitely recommend the manta. If you want more bang for ur buck buy online so you can go right into the park. if I ever go back I hope the STAFF is polite and not rude"
1118,3/26/2018,5,Today my 5 children and I visited Seaworld San Diego and the customer service we received from Markell was above and beyond! He helped to make our day Great!! Thank you
1119,11/29/2016,5,"My family enjoyed the shows. It was very educational and we learn a lot. As it was weekday, there was no line= the shows were only scheduled once or twice a day. Wish they had more shows but I understand the reason behind. We will come back for sure."
1120,8/18/2015,5,I miss this place. I went twice to this place I loved the shows the ride and most of all getting the experience to interact with the dolphins. I had the best time.
1121,11/19/2014,5,I took two of my client's who are disabled we had a good time the staff was so accommodating and very pleasant. I will come back again.I love coming during the week no long waite for rides and good seates for the shows. I love the way the staff really care for the animals . So a big shout out to the animal staff.
1122,8/30/2015,5,"Simply Marvelous! If you mention you took a trolley/bus to Sea World you receive $5 off admission. We spent the whole day there and did not see everything. Although the observation tower ride was down, we went on the aerial tram ride, which was awesome! We saw a fantastic show with the dolphins and whales. One of my favorite attractions was the moving conveyer in the shark tunnel. Sea World provides a lot of interesting and educational opportunities to learn about ocean life.The only negative comment I have is the cost of admission... it is twice as much as the zoo, which doesn't seem right, as we found them equally entertaining."
1123,9/21/2017,1,"The ride is supposed to open 1 hour after the park is opened. But the lazy mechanic decided they need more time to rest,. So ,30 minutes late they are still testing the ride and guests are all waiting in Â the rain. They should all be fired!!!!!"
1124,10/27/2016,5,"When you want to find a place to enjoy with your families, the SeaWorld is the best choice in San Diego. I like the whale, dolphin and sea lion. The whale show was definitely dynamic, so you would be surprised by their performance. You couldn't believe that the whales perform like dolphin. It was my favorite zoo in U.S."
1125,10/6/2014,4,"Woohoo!! Finally got to go sea world!! Sea world was having Halloween theme and fall theme at the park so it was more fun! Â They were giving away candies and saw children dressed up:) so cute- even they had Halloween themed sea lion n otter performing on the stadium- so cute!! :)Got to see dolphin n killer whale shows as well- it's amazing how they trained the sea animals to perform- Â although I was aware that trainers were not allowed to swim with killer whales during the show due to tragic events, I thought it was pretty awesome how Â they were able to trained to whales-Also I went to Atlantis ride and wracked ship ride- Â u can get quick queue pass if u dont wanna wait in line- Â but they both were short n fun rides- Â of course u can't compare to six flags rides, but it was good to get somewater flashes on a hot day! Â Can't wait to ride mantis ride next time!Got a good deal where I get to come back for free before 12/25... Excited n looking forward to check out winter theme and good walk out of the park! :)"
1126,12/26/2015,5,"The 5 Stars are for the staff. They have some great employees who are cheerful, friendly and welcoming.Last time we went there was a medical emergency in the women's restroom and Sea World nurses were called. They knew the patient who needed help, she is a Sea World regular. They were so helpful to her and willing to help her.I am disappointed Â that both on Halloween and Christmas the cream cheese pretzel cart was closed. I love seeing the animal shows, but I am happy they will no longer have the Killer Whale shows, they need less training and more room to swim."
1127,11/10/2014,5,"We had an amazing day. We enjoyed the rides, the shows, the exhibitions, the food. All fantastic treats in one package. Dine with Shamu was really special."
1128,9/16/2012,3,"My bf and I went here this weekend for his belated birthday. Â I paid $68 for a day pass on its website. Â Parking was $15.We saw the Shamu show and the otter show. Â We rode on the gondola and the simulator arctic ride. Â The heat was merciless. Â We had lunch at one of the cafes and it was awful.My bf suggested misters throughout the park and large canopies to provide shade for the shows. Â We had a lot of fun, but the park really needs to step up its game."
1129,6/25/2012,4,"I want my own zoo and I have attempted to steal a penguin no less than three times. Recently I discovered you must have at least 7 penguins to own any whatsoever or they get sick and die...this made my penguin plan slightly more difficult...sad! So when the family was in town I knew I needed to do more recon anyways, off to the world of the sea! When you live in SD you get out of town visitors all the time! It's one of those cities where people really DO come see you so be prepared! When your family descends, pack em in the rental car, and drag em out to see Shamu and friends-yay Seaworld! Parking is about 15 dollars, and tickets at the door are around 70$ OUCH! HOWEVER, when you buy it online it saves you about 20$ a ticket, so do that, print em out, and off you go! Plus that's one less line you're gonna have to stand in. You can totally bring food into the park so to save a bit pack some snacks and waters-It's all available at a premium inside too of course. Rapid fire love: -The newest show: Blue Horizons! -Cirque La Mer! (too short but awesome skill level)-The new roller coasted, sting ray themed! -The selection of shot glasses. Our collection just got bigger and features animals of the sea-The water rides(TIP: get yelp superher0 ponchos from your CM sometime...so handy!)-Shamu Show: Amazing! -Vegan and GF snack packs! That's rad SW! Meh, coulda been better:-The churros...I know! Normally these would have been the first thing I mentioned, if not the whole reason I came, BUT-Mine was lukewarm, hard in places, and rubbery...AKA:OLD!! C'mon Seaworld, at 3 bucks-ish a pop they should be soft and hott and sinfully delish-to the point of buying another one when no one is looking. Sorely disappointing. It's a week later....and I'm not over it. -The Penguin exhibit. You know that scene in ""Happy Feet"" where they stare at the wall and hallucinate? Yeah. This is where they got the idea for that. I'm sure it state of the art but it's damn sad. Don't worry penguins! I'll get you out...someday. -The food in general. I wish the restaurants here were more of the Disney quality. Overpriced, fine, I knew that. Sub-par for one million dollars? Meh again. All in all, Seaworld? Love you, but you owe me a churro."
1130,10/7/2014,4,"Such a awesome experience, we were worried about the price tag and how much it would cost but it was so worth it. The dolphin show was great and the dolphin encounters ( even though we didn't do that) we got to see the dolphins, sea lion, we got to see the killer whales. It was wonderful! ! We got the seven day pass for 3 Parks and it was totally worth. if you go to sea world twice it's worth it what you don't know when you buy the pass is that parking is $16 day & not included so its better to get there early however the dolphin show is at 1245 and the killer whale show is at 230 which requires you to stay there almost an entire day"
1131,9/3/2012,4,"Of all amusement parks, SeaWorld ranks just behind Disneyland for me personally but I think there are some things here that beat out Disneyland too.I love sea life so that's probably why SeaWorld is a favorite of mine. Â They've added some rides to make it more appealing to the younger crowd and I also think the food is better here as well. Â A summary:- Favorite show = Clyde & Seymour! Â I love the sea lion show and it's always funny...my niece and nephew love this show the most; shamu & dolphin shows were also good but this one really got their attention.- Great food selection = it's not a huge park so there's not a million food places but they have great adult and kid choices; not just greasy fast food stuff. Â I got lunch for the whole family including chicken caesar salad, bbq ribs/chicken/tri tip, chicken strips, fresh watermelon and strawberries and some kids meals come with raisins and carrots. Â The pricing wasn't too bad either...I mean, we are at an amusement park but I think we spent about $65 for four adults and two kids to eat which really isn't bad at all in my opinion.- Shamu shaped food is awesome! Â Ice cream bars, cookies and pretzels in the shape of a killer whale was fun to eat.- Parking is weird. Â They half direct you where to park but we noticed that there were so many spaces that were empty towards the front...could use some improvement.- Stroller parking is crazy! Â I understand that there's going to be a lot of strollers but it's complete mayhem finding yours. Â - Great interaction with the animals. Â We touched rays, fed sea lions and you have the options of dining next to Shamu, swimming with dolphins or even with the beluga whales. Â I may never go to Hawaii...but maybe for a birthday, I'll book a day to play with some dolphins and whales. =)- Favorite exhibits = sea lions, sea turtles and polar bears; they used to let you buy fish to feed dolphins but I think they removed this which made me sad but you can still feed sea lions and other animals here.One last thing I liked about SeaWorld is that you can see everything you want in one full day. Â A place like Disneyland is impossible to do in just one day...the wait times there and all the different rides make it into an expensive place but SeaWorld has a lot of options and it's all do-able in a short time. Â  We don't visit every year but it's always a place our entire family likes to visit."
1132,2/12/2017,5,"I absolutely loved my visit to Sea World. The staff were friendly, the shows were a nice mix of entertaining and educational, and the park was very clean. I think it's definitely worth planning your trip here around the showtimes. They're the real stars of Sea World. Don't come here expecting the best aquarium/shark tunnel in the world. The point is more about seeing the interactions between humans and animals, I think. Come with at least 5-6 hours put aside for this place!"
1133,8/29/2015,4,"My husband and I love Seaworld primarily because we're a military family, and Seaworld offers FREE passes for active duty families. We enjoyed the rides, shows, aquariums, and military discounted meal passes! The tacos at the Shipwreck Cafe were delicious! The only thing that bummed us out was that the some of the animals seem to have small tanks without natural plant life."
1134,7/1/2012,4,"NBD. Â I fed some dolphins and pilot whales. Â Then I got to touch those rubbery suckers and make them do tricks and make fart noises. Â Once again, NBD. Â Alright, it was actually a pretty big deal...I'm not trying to act like 6 year old little kid or anything, but getting to chill with these little guys (which aren't so little) was something I have always wanted to do. Â I am lucky enough to have a friend who is one of the dolphin/whale trainers and she really hooked it up with some free tix which were *cough *cough, 80 something bucks each! Â We watched her do her thing in front of a packed audience and then we got the grand tour ""behind the scenes"" of the show and how it all works. Â Let's just say now I know why she never stays out late or drinks on the nights before she has to work. Â This would have to be the most impossible job to do hungover! Â Needless to say we were very impressed by the show.After the flippy floppy dolphins we wandered around and drank a bunch of Bud Lights. Â Pretty classy, I know. Â We stumbled upon a place in the park where you could shoot the unsuspecting people on one of the water rides with a secret water cannon for $0.25. Â They never saw it coming and was well worth the $5.00 we spent on it. Â NBD."
1135,8/23/2016,2,First time I've ever gone to seaworld I bought a funcard and I don't know why . It was boring . Everything is overpriced . Not too many attractions . I won't be going back
1136,9/28/2016,5,"Seeing Shamu rip apart a stray Pelican was hilarious. Poor girl, probably got fed up with the same nasty fish guts she's given on a daily basis. These whales deserve a better life but thankfully they're not too far from medical professionals within the city to keep them healthy."
1137,3/7/2015,5,"Love this place.Come here every other weekend, my daughter absolutely Â loves the ""petting"" tanksFood and drinks are overpriced but it's expected.Watching the shows never get old. I am always amazed.Fun little excursion Â with the family definitely Â a must for so cal Â people to have a funpass"
1138,7/17/2015,5,"Not only are the trainers and staff helpful and informative, the park is fun! Â The shows are amazing. Â They show videos of how SeaWorld helps the sea community, in answer to the awful movie (which I didn't see, since I know it's going to be biased and hateful) Â But, good for SeaWorld for giving back, helping the sea creatures, and being helpful to tourists. Â It was such a great and fun time seeing all the animals, and how SeaWorld works. Â I really enjoyed feeding the sea lions! :) Â And the pet show is so fun! :)Thanks!!"
1139,6/5/2014,3,"I'm breaking up with SeaWorld. Â It is hard because I've invested a lot. Â I still have their annual pass.My memories and idea of it are actually better than what it has become. Â I no longer want to dwell on the memories and continue to hope only to be disappointed again and again. Â Promises to be better now fall on deaf ears. Â Enough is enough. Â Time to move on.The rides are still fun, gets my heart racing. Â For 30 seconds. Â Get's me wet but shivering and miserable right after. Â Is it worth it? Â Not anymore.I will look back fondly at the times when the trainers could still go in the pool with the whales. Â Now they play together but with a barrier between them. Â Once trust is broken, once a life was taken away, there is no going back.At least I have memories of a better past.Yes, dammit. Â I'm talking about my break up with SeaWorld and not my ""breakup-breakup."" Â -.-"
1140,11/11/2016,5,"I absolutely love going to SeaWorld with my family, get the fun pass and go for the whole year if you can. Â It's a little pricey but well worth it if you make an effort to get there once or twice a month. Â Don't believe the hype, SeaWorld cares for its animals Â above all else and their rescue efforts are beyond world class. Â Go for a few hours, have a great time and maybe learn a little something about the beautiful animals we share this world with."
1141,8/19/2015,4,"Great employees, clean facility, given black eye by documentary black fish. Â The concession food could be a little better."
1142,8/12/2014,5,"As a parent, it was hot, sticky, costly, and my feet were killing me.So I think it's only fair to review Sea World based on the experience my kids (5, and 8) had.The entrance is completely redone here, and it looks fantastic. Sea World looked pretty dumpy from the outside a few years ago, but now the bright colors, bubbles, digital displays, and music make the park more appealing from the get go.Explorers reef is waiting for you when you walk in. Everything in the reef is available for touching. My kids liked the sharks, horse shoe crabs, and rays, but my 5 year old was entertained with the doctor fish for almost 45 minutes. Too bad parents can't pony up an extra $50 for a pedicure while they are sitting here!The bay of play was another hot spot. Lines are long, and there are a LOT of little kids and families here. My kids loved the obstacle course rope nets.Forget about Shamu and the hoopla surrounding that guy. Clyde and Seamore are, in our opinion, the show that you should be rushing to see. Clyde and Seamore is the one show that parents and kids will love. Get there early, of course for seating, but you don't want to miss the ""pre show"" show with Biff and his antics. Sure, it's a little corny, but my kids laughed and laughed. If you need to cool off, hit up wild artic where you can sit in an air conditioned motion simulator ride, check out the polar bears, and touch a real ice wall.When you are hungry, the all day dining option is the way to go. For around $30 per adult, and $20 per kid, you can choose any entree, drink, and side at four main restaurants all day long at no additional cost to you. Feel like having a dessert and a drink? Go for it. You want a plate of chicken and some coleslaw? Chow down my friend! Our total for a family of four was $120 for all day dining, and we ate three times at the park. We figured we broke even after two meals.We didn't stick around for fireworks, and opted to beat the rush by getting to our car before 10."
1143,11/5/2014,3,"Their 50th so good deals all around, except the $15 plates for food -___-Back in July, 2014"
1144,6/22/2018,5,"We checked out the new shows and attractions for this year/this summer and were really impressed! Rides/attractions: The new coaster, Electric Eel, is super fun! It's a great fit for the park and awesome for those of us who like more thrilling rides. It's fast, tall, and really packs a punch (although the line for the ride does move pretty slow). My little niece and nephew loved the Sesame Street parade. We were able to find a spot on the parade route about 20 minutes before it started. Find your spot early, because the parade viewing areas get crowded. My family loved the parade - it was cute and fun. Every kid was all smiles as Elmo and friends danced by. It's a great addition to the park and perfect for kids. Shows: Illuminight is brand new this year - almost none of the show elements are the same from last summer and in my opinion that's great. We enjoyed this updated show more than last years! Cirque Electrique was incredible. The light-up costumes were striking and the performers are seriously impressive. New to the show this year is a segment with a jet ski and that dude did 4 backflips IN A ROW! I had no idea jet skis could do that. We always leave that show feeling wowed. Finally, the laser reef show at the end of the night is also improved from last year. Multiple lasers overhead form a ceiling of lights and textures that mesmerized us (I also really just happen to love lasers) and this laser show is a great end to the day."
1145,6/9/2014,1,"Yes, I have been to Sea World before. Â No, I did not enjoy it. Â Take a circus from the days of old and mix it with a zoo from the 70's and this is what you get.I'm going to Disneyland."
1146,2/18/2015,5,"Love Sea World Friendly staff I feel stress free Love to be close to nature, beautiful place Love all Shows and Shops Happy fun times"
1147,8/1/2015,3,If we didn't have a military discount this would get one star. Â It was super crowded attractions had over an hour wait. Â  The shows were soooo short. Â  Save your 90 dollars a ticket and go to zoo.
1148,11/6/2014,5,"It was hot (like Summer) today, so I decided to visit the park. This year is the 50th Anniversary and signs with photos are posted all over the park advising (or reminding) visitors how the park once was. The park is prepping for the Holiday Season, which is nice (I love amusement parks this time of year). Â This park is Â great for young and old alike. Many of the animal enclosures provide excellent observation of the animals and most areas have staff or keepers available to answer questions. If you have thrill seekers in your group there are 2 decent roller coaster type rides (Journey to Atlantis & Manta). Younger ones might like the Wild Arctic Helicopter Simulator & Shipwreck Rapids Tube ride, as well as the ride just northwest of the Shark exhibit. The park also has a section for little ones that includes photo opportunities with Sesame Street characters and kiddie rides. There are shows throughout the park if rides aren't your thing. Â FYI: Winter World runs 11/15/14 - 01/05/15 (snow area for those that can't make it out to the mountains)"
1149,7/24/2014,4,The kids loved Sea World. They were fascinated with the cleaner fishes. I was too! They cleaned your hands. Kinda felt like a massage while vibrating your hand. The Atlantis water ride was spectacular. The whole family loved it. The killer whale show was disappointing but we enjoyed the whales splashing the audience. The dolphin show was amazing. The smoke house was a great place to eat with the family and the food was good. The wait time on the rides was not too bad.
1150,10/1/2014,5,Loved love love SeaWorld! Â Lots of fun rides. Â The orca show was lame. Â They didn't even swim with them. Â Dolphins were awesome. Â Love me some penguin time.
1151,9/30/2014,4,We love Seaworld and didn't want to watch Blackfish before we went so we wouldn't look at the park in a negative light and I must say it's exactly as I remember. Â  The shows were entertaining and staff friendly. Â  It must've been an off-peak season or Blackfish really did some damage since the park was not crowded at all but that's fine with me. Â My only complaint was the $16 parking...and if you're lazy you can pay $21 to park two rows closer than we did.
1152,10/20/2016,3,"Sea World was a fun walk with the kids. As an avid NW sailor I've/we've seen Orcas and porpoise in the wild numerous times so the shows didn't make much of an impression on me. I find it a little sad they're dropping the Orcas show though. I'm certain it peeks the interest of many youngsters in a scientific or conservation direction. Hopefully they find a way to keep the whales engaged so they don't literally become bored to death. They're mammals...they need mental stimulation and they can't simply be sent back to the wild at this point. (Oops, sorry, getting off soapbox now)Bring your own bottled water...go to lunch on your way to the park....my only advice. I'm glad Sea World is there engaging people and asking them to think, recycle, respect the environment, etc. even if it's a little plasticky/commercial. I don't mind paying such a high admission for a venue with a noble sanctuary/rescue/conservation mission."
1153,2/15/2013,4,"I love sea animals and polar bears! This is a great park for a dates, families, and friends! I love the Shamu show and I definitely enjoyed seeing the penguins and polar bears. I had an unforgettable experience here and I definitely recommend it for everyone!TIP - if you order your tickets online, you get a discount. Every dollar counts!"
1154,2/15/2011,4,"After Hash House, of course we definitely wanted to walk it off at Sea World. The beauty of coming here was that we got in for FREE. Â I want to thank my youngest sister for the ticket as my Christmas gift and of course free for heroes :) I haven't been to this place in a loooooooong time. I don't even really recall the first time I've been here. All I know was that I wanted to see the Shamu and Dolphin Show. Â The bf said the shows are not the same from when he saw it years ago. Good thing I don't remember it from years ago! I just liked taking pictures of the whales and dolphins doing their tricks. AWESOME! Â Petting the manta rays and feeding the flamingos was sweet. Â The Polar Bears were cool, I wanted to throw them some coca-cola...too bad Sea World is sponsored by Pepsi (BOO)! The Journey to Atlantis ride was fun!I liked checking out the Sharks and all the fishes in the aquariums. The Wild Artic ride was interesting.Overall, we had a great experience. Â I don't know if we would be back anytime soon to pay $70/head. Crazy!"
1155,1/4/2013,3,Buy 1 day get the rest of 2013 for free! Sign me up! Yay for the fun card! Â I told my nephews we can go every single day (excluding the black out days). Â They just look at me like im crazy which is usually the same look they give me every time I see them. Â All I wanted to do was watch shows and run up the stairs like a crazy auntie who doesn't want to get wet but stays in the soak zone because that's where her nephews wanted to sit. Â The Shamu show isn't the same though. Â They don't ride Shamu during the show like they used to. Â And there is some bar now blocking the kids from standing by the glass and getting soaked from the water when Shamu would pass by. Â I liked the glass area where you can see the killer whales swim Â I got some really cool pictures of that. Â My nephews wanted to ride the Manta. Â My stomach can't handle that. Â They had fun though! Â They wanted me to ride a ride with them so I rode the Atlantis. Â I should've rode the other one because we were soaked after! Â I had to pay $5 to use the dryer because I didn't want my nephews to get sick. Â Not a good idea to ride that during the winter! Anyways I am excited for 2013 because I can take my nephews again. Â I like the deal for the fun card and I am glad I got a good xmas bonus because any other time of the year I wouldn't want to spend $70 per ticket to go to Sea World.
1156,1/31/2016,5,"SEAWORLD is absolutely amazing. The care, the love, and the devotion for their animals is unconditional. I am thrilled and cannot wait for the new whale project! The park is always so clean, and everyone is so friendly! I love all the shows, I just wish we could get he trainers back in the water! It was soooooo beautiful to watch the shamu shows when they were allowed to do the tricks with them"
1157,8/30/2014,5,"Best amusement park ever. I love this place ,but it can get really hot during the day.I enjoyed every ride and loved every show. Shamu is the best. This shoe makes me wanna jump into water and hug all killer whales . They are so cute and adorable. Manta ride was the best of all."
1158,8/18/2014,4,"As a San Diego native I have visited this park many times. From frequently going all throughout my childhood, to visiting with a boyfriend or friends in my teens, and then recently chaperoning my 4 and 6 year old nephew and niece I can definitely say that this park is for all ages and I will continue to go back.One of the reasons San Diegans love Sea World used to be because of their prices. It was reasonably priced for a day ticket and they allowed you to come back for the rest of the year free. However, after visiting this past weekend and paying $80 for a pass to use the next 6 months I was appalled! Might as well have gone to Disney! However, despite all recent Blackfish debates, SeaWorld is still a company I am happy to support. They have redone a lot of exhibits and added tons of new stuff! I was really impressed by the cleanliness of the park as well as the new exhibits and rides. I also appreciated that the shows are always changing and that a few have been revamped. A few tips for first timers or those vacationing:-SUNSCREEN! I cannot stress it enough. Even if it is cloudy this park is near the ocean and there is not much shade. Bathe your kids in it and bring extra!-Change of clothes. Your kids are going to find ways to get wet and you need to let them! Part of the fun of Seaworld is sitting in the slash zones, playing in the water parks, and touching the animals in a few exhibits! I promise you cant avoid this!-Bring sippy cups for young kids. Seaworld does not have lids anywhere in the park. If you buy your child a drink with lunch be aware it will come in an open cup!-Skip the Shamu show. I know its a classic and you feel like you need to see it, but you don't. They redid the script and its pretty boring not to mention the whales look really unhappy! Go to the pet show or sea lion/otter show they are hilarious and I guarantee that even if you are 40 years old or 50 you are going to crack up!The main thing which really pained me about the park, which I hope Seaworld will make an effort to improve, is the lack of water fountains. As a company which prides itself on conservation and recycling you would think that you would see them everywhere! We brought a reusable water bottle during our visit and it stayed empty the entire time since we could not locate a single fountain!"
1159,7/26/2016,5,"I LOVE SEAWORLD! This place is so awesome! Â I went a few years ago and just went back twice in the same week with my two young children. Â The dolphin show, Â killer whale show, sea lion show, all the shows, Â the exhibits, Â the rides, Â all excellent! Â If I wasn't going home today I'd Â go back again, Â we barely saw it all in two days and didn't even do everything there. Â I really hope SeaWorld doesn't end up losing their killer whales, Â but If they do I guess I'll have to go to Florida to see them. Â  Thanks for being so awesome and providing such an excellent park!"
1160,4/10/2014,5,This was a wonderful vacation. Do your own research people and don't just listen to a pseudo-'documentary'. Inform yourself and you will see the good this group does for marine life.
1161,7/29/2008,5,I got drunk at Sea World! Yep...me and my friend went for the day and spent 3 hours in the hospitality center where they give out free samples of beer! Â Boo ya! Â There is this tasting that you can sign up for and they give you cheese and crackers and fruit that compliment the beer you are tasting. Â We walked out of there pretty happy.Oh yeah...we saw shamu. Â That was cool too!
1162,1/5/2018,5,"Just enjoyed an amazing day with my wife and son here at Seaworld San Diego. We haven't been here since we were kids and still remember how educational this wonderful place was for us both back then. I am so happy our kids still have the opportunity to learn about ocean life of all sizes up close and how precious wildlife is. All of the trainers appear to really love what they do and most importantly love all of the wildlife here. I understand that being stuck in a tank or cage is NOT an ideal place, however, the educational benefits that teach us all from a young age to respect and love life on our planet is worth it. I love our oceans and all of it's life and I'm so thankful for Seaworlds help in teaching my children how to respect our oceans."
1163,3/17/2013,5,"I absolutely LOVE this Sea World! I went with my dad, mom and sister, and it was a really great place to bring a family with college-age kids! My parents loved the aquariums. The assortment of turtles, fish, polar bears, walruses, and sharks mesmerized my parents. Turtle Reef, Shark Encounter, and Dolphin Encounter had to be one of my favorites. Sea Lions Live was hilarious, Shamu Rocks was dynamic, and Blue Horizons was a bit lame with the humans in the show...but you can't hate on kid fanfare! We had a Socal discount and a coupon from McDs so it came out to around $65 a person. That's not too bad in comparison with other Socal theme parks! Parking was a bit confusing and the entrance to Sea World is actually not too clear, but the park itself was amazing!Bill Tip: Funny story, my family is Asian, and we asked another Asian man to help us take a picture. The white lady behind us asked the Asian man nicely if he also wanted to be in the picture. I didn't know what she was talking about until I made the connection...she thought the Asian man was in our family! Very nice of her to help out haha, but don't make assumptions! I do appreciate people who offer to take pictures cause sometimes you can't find anyone. Bill Tip #2: Club Atlantis was poppin! This isn't Vegas though so keep it G! Good god, there are kids around!"
1164,11/5/2012,4,"I had a great time at Sea World this past weekend. The weather in San Diego was beautiful as usual. We got to the park around 12pm and realized that the One Ocean whale show was just starting!! So we sprinted over to the Shamu Stadium to catch the last few minutes of the show. I would recommend checking the showtimes prior to getting to Sea World or the minute you enter the park. Luckily the times of the shows worked out well with our schedule and we had the opportunity to see the whale, dolphin, and sea lion shows... all of which are only available 2-3 times a day. I really enjoyed the animal exhibits -- the Turtle Reef and Shark Encounter being my two favorites. There is just so much to do at Sea World! We barely had time to ride any rides =( I also want to note that compared to Disneyland, everything at Sea World is MUCH more affordable. Tip: If you have access to UCItems store at UC Irvine, they sell Sea World tickets at about $20 cheaper than at the door."
1165,2/16/2015,4,We went to sea world in 2014 during November in the middle of the week so there were no crowds. Â Our one-day admission tickets came with extra free tickets for the next year and also free souvenir cups and soda drinks which was a nice touch.We really love the special feature of the cleaner fish at the entrance. The small fish take off the dead skin from your arms- it does not hurt! The shows were amazing. Couldn't believe that the Dolphins could jump so high! It was funny when the guy told the dolphins to splash us. Very entertaining. The food wasn't amazing but we did find a nice cafÃ©- the ship wreck reef cafÃ©.
1166,12/22/2017,2,11:45 and some rides and food stands are not open yet!!! Â  Seriously overpay for a day pass!
1167,3/7/2014,1,"A waste of time and a waste of money.The attraction site is extremely overpriced and not worth it at all. Tickets, drinks, rides, parking, food, everything was too pricey. Not only did the park waste money, but the ridiculously long lines were a waste of time. The average people in the park were bratty, pampered crying kids and with equally as annoying parents. And for the ""main attraction"", the shows were mostly videos. It had decent use of technology, but if I wanted to see video, I would have went to the movie theater. The unnecessary flashing lights and loud ""inspirational"" music hurt my eyes and ears. I was unimpressed by the whole show. Also, SeaWorld constantly refers to its parks as ""educational"", but it was more of a failed attempt of being ""entertaining"". Rather than being entertained (or educated), I genuinely felt empathy for the poor animals. They were simply too big to be kept in such miniscule exhibits. All the polar bear had room to do was pace back and forth, absolutely heartbreaking to have an animal with such great potential be caged for the entertainment of others.The rides were subpar, the park's overall ambiance was felt faux, and no one in my family had a good time. The food was overcooked, overpriced, and was not satisfying. The tour guides were unhelpful and unknowledgeable. Plus the park was super confusing, I felt like I spent more time on the mobile app of the map of the park than actually enjoying the park.I will NOT be returning and I highly suggest going on a whale watching boat tour instead (using the same amount of money, you could have went at least twice) if you are considering going to SeaWorld. The best I can say is that SeaWorld tried."
1168,11/11/2016,4,"I went here with my son today, Veterans Day. It was his second, my first time. It was fun. Our favorite show was the Sea Lions. They were funny and cute. We saw the Shamu show. I think they're trying to change their image about how they impact the community and the animals. Unnoticed it because in the shows, they talked about how it was important to have the animals healthy and that it's their priority to build them up and help the community and so on."
1169,7/19/2016,5,I took my family and they loved this park! The shows were incredible! It wasn't too bad for being the summer. The kids didn't want to leave. They loved every minute of it.
1170,5/6/2014,5,"My husband and I and our 3 year old daughter grew up in South Central Pennsylvania, so visiting SeaWorld has always been a dream for us! My husband is in the military and we just moved out here about 2 years ago. The only issue we had at SeaWorld was as soon as we got there. Lines moved smoothly but to get our military discount was more of a hassle than it should have been, and we were with another military family also! If I wouldn't have had proof that my husband and I had the same last name we wouldn't have gotten the discount, and surprisingly did (stupid me forgot my military ID at home) which is what caused the hassle. Other than that, our ENTIRE experience was as magical as we've always dreamed!! BUT, if you plan on eating at all, bring a ton of money because it is OUTRAGEOUS! We got a very, very small pizza, a drink to share and a small salad, for $50!!!!! I couldn't believe it! And it all tasted awful! So make sure your belly is full unless you want to pay even more for better food because that was the cheapest place to eat that we could find!! On a side note, SeaWorld is so magical for all ages, and we will definitely be visiting again. I have never been filled with so much joy for an entire day!! Ah it's an amazing experience!"
1171,12/29/2016,2,"I am typically a huge fan of Sea World though not today! I have been coming since I was a child and usually come with my own kids about once a year. Â In early November, Â I called to ask how crowded it would be the week after Christmas. Â I was told they were usually pretty quiet, Â so we drove 2 hours only to find that it took us more than 45 minutes from the time we exited the freeway to the time we parked due to the line to get through to parking. Â I should have known Â it was going to be a very crowded day and yet I was still surprised that we stood in line for 1 hour Â and 10 minutes. Â Further, Â we could get into neither show we wanted to see at 3:45. I strongly recommend avoiding Sea World the week after Christmas."
1172,7/30/2016,4,"We made a special trip to San Diego this summer so we could take the kids to the Shamu show since it ends in December. The kids had a great time seeing all of the shows. I am glad we went online and printed show times in advance. Some of the shows are only a few time a day & we would have missed them. I highly recommend a hat, sunglasses, comfortable walking shoes & plenty of sunscreen. None of the shows have any shade. You are sitting on metal bleachers in full sun. Even with ample sunscreen, a few of the adults still burned pretty badly.I also recommend purchasing reserved seating for the night shows (Seal & Shamu). It was $15.00 per person but it was worth it. It gave you great seats, a seat cushion & a dessert box. I forgot to take a pic but the box included a brownie, a cookie, cheesecake bites, marshmallows & two small macaroons. I wish we would have purchased the all day meal plan. It was $34.99 for adults & $18.99 kids 3+. You could eat once an hour if you wanted. It provided: an entree, side or dessert and a non-alcoholic beverage. We spent way too much money to eat chicken tenders & slices of pizza. If you drink soda or lemonade, I would recommend paying the $16.99 for the free refills cup. The cost of one soda could buy a 12-pack at the store. Parking was $22.00 & it was still quite a walk to the main gate. We definitely got our money's worth. We arrived at 10:00am & stayed until closing at 10:00pm. The fireworks show was a great way to end the day."
1173,2/9/2014,1,I regret coming here due to how sad it made me to see the Polar Bear exhibit and how this Polar Bear was in such a small space the poor thing was pacing back in forth it was unbearable to watch. Regarding the orcas... Having 5 whales in one big bath tub really? Shame on u Sea World
1174,1/31/2013,5,"My family loves SeaWorld! Â We did the 2 year silver pass and it allowed us to make payments every month (so much easier) and we get discount on food, events and free parking. Â There is so much to do! Â We have been there twice now and still have not seen all the shows. Â They do offer a special unlimited food package...which I highly recommend if you plan on staying at the park all day. Â We did this the 2nd visit. Â Cost is $35 per adult and $15 per child (3 to 9) and you get a drink, entree and a side or dessert every time you go through line (it is valid at 4 different restaurants). Â One time, my kids just wanted a dessert and milk and that is what we got. Â We had breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert the entire day. Â Not a bad deal at all!I am excited about their 50th anniversary coming up 2014 (which is why I purchased the 2 year plan not before the prices really go up for that event).1 note of warning....the river water ride will drench you! Â Most of those types of rides can get you wet (which is what I expected) but not drenched. Â Be prepared."
1175,1/7/2017,5,"The Christmas celebration was amazing especially the pink elf named Peggy, she was an absolute riot! I am also super excited for the new electric eel ride coming next year. The sea lion show is hilarious, based off of SNL and worth your time to watch!!"
1176,4/21/2010,3,"Why the 3 Stars? Because I go to Disneyland a lot and I was at California Adventures just the day before I went to Sea World. In Disney parks vs Sea World ... Disney wins! BUT....Sea World is PERFECT for little ones and their families :) They have a Sesame Street 4D show, kiddie rides, and a lot of fun sea animals.Parking is $12 for a regular car. Buy a ticket now and you get to go again! It's a good price if you love Sea World.I enjoyed being able to touch and hold a starfish and stingray. The sharks were fierce and they really set the mood by playing the sound of a heartbeat slowly thumping. Walking through the clear glass shark tunnel made me feel like i was in a scene from Jaws. Those Great Whites are amazing! Â The penguins are adorable and be sure to try and feed the flamingos. You can get a handful of pellets for 50 cents.I caught the Pets Rule show where we watched dogs, cats, a pig, and birds run around the stage. I was able to resist buying one of the $11 Shamu shaped cups filled with lemonade. But I did cave in and bought a Shamu shaped ice cream stick.Warning: Ride the wet rides when it's sunny and earlier in the day so that you can dry off as you walk through the park. Shipwreck rapids was too fun! You cannot avoid getting wet in this ride. Abbeys Sea Star Spin is similar to the Tea Cups ride in Disneyland. I definitely left a bit more dizzy afterwards. For $6 you can ride both the Skytower and the Bayside Skyride overlooking the park and San Diego."
1177,1/6/2018,1,"I really wish I could give 0 stars. Just had the worst experience. Went online to buy two tickets to go to SeaWorld for my nieces birthday tomorrow. The website was not working properly and my acct was charged twice for the transaction of $190.71 and I didn't even get my tickets. I went back and forth with my bank and SeaWorld with pretty much both saying there's nothing they can do. Eventually, I had to pay an additional $190.71 to make sure that I am able to go to SeaWorld for my nieces birthday tomorrow. After all the hassle and inconvenience, I asked if I could have a discount for the inconvenience and I was told no. So pretty much, I paid. Total of $512.13 for 2 SeaWorld tickets. I understand that the money will eventually go back into my acct, but that'll take days and will effect the amount of money I have to spend for the next couple of days. The customer service representatives I spoke with at SeaWorld had no empathy at all. I am only going for my nieces. I will never go to SeaWorld again after this experience. And what sucks is that I was really looking forward to it."
1178,8/21/2012,4,"Everyone has to go at least once! Â It's something you do every 10 years, like Universal Studios! Â We stuck with the shows and attractions, didn't go on any rides. Â The Arctic exhibit was my favorite with the Beluga Whales and Polar bears. Â I do feel shame in seeing a Polar Bear outside in 80 degree weather. Â Not normal. Â All of the trainers have a true passion for what they do and you can see it. Â You can pet bat rays, the dolphin point is worth hanging out in, the dolphins come up to you and you can pet them. Â Young, old, in between, you have to go at least once!"
1179,12/22/2016,5,Came during the Halloween time and they actually have Halloween Spooktacular event. It was really fun and my nephew loved it.
1180,2/8/2017,4,"We bought the 3 day park hopper from our Costco here in Las Vegas. Â Kids had a blast, especially this random turtle just walking around the park. Â Story is, he's been roaming for over 40 years they said. Â Fireworks every night before the park closes. Â really a memorable trip...and yes, it's Southern California. Â Everything is expensive!"
1181,9/10/2010,4,"It's a lot different from what I remembered. Last time I went was sophomore year of high school (1999). The exhibits are short and the shows are ~25 minutes long and the park is super small. I could probably walk around the park in less than 10 minutes. However the fun and excitement of watching such huge sea creatures perform is still absolutely amazing! It's about the same tricks as before, but the whales are a little better at spraying water at people. Â 5 stars for entertainment value. 3.5 stars for such short exhibits and not having all that much to do.I took advantage of the AYCE and it is TOTALLY worth it! $30. You can have an entree, side, and drink each time. Meals are about ~$12 anyways. Bottled water is $3.50 at the stands. So if you eat lunch and dinner, you've already got your money worth. I probably ate like 5 meals!!!! The food isn't bad either, it's like cafeteria food. 5 stars for the AYCE."
1182,1/3/2009,5,"I've done the Behind The Scenes Tour....I've done the Saving The Species Tour....and I just needed to do one more and I had that all in the bag. Today was that day. I went with my friend and we did the Penguin Experience Tour. FRICKING AWESOME!!!! We went behind the penguin encounter and where all the other people have to view them from the front piece of glass, me and my tour group got to view them from behind the glass in the freeeeezing room!!!!!!!!!!!Also, I know I have given this place mainly 5 stars all the time, but seriously, with how much you are charging for parking, tickets and everything else, you go and raise the price of the fish that you use to feed the animals?!?!!??!! who the heck makes it $6!!! such an odd number and now people will be carrying around so many $1 in their pocket. you should have just left it at $5 and made it a nice solid even number where math is easy."
1183,1/19/2018,5,"Seaworld is worth every penny it's educational, they have rides, shows, and the food is much better than other amusement parks. Â I have been a member for several years, and I never tire of going there. Â Christmas is stunning at Seaworld with lovely decorations and festive shows. Â The dolphin interaction was something me and my family will treasure the rest of our lives. Â My son attended Camp Seaworld two years in a row and is a devoted camper. Â I highly recommend going there!"
1184,4/24/2014,4,"It had been quite a while since I'd been to Sea World here in San Diego. Â At least since before the latest ride, the Manta was built, so my girlfriend and I bought the Fun Card which gives us almost unlimited visits (a few blackout dates, not many, and what local would want to go on Thanksgiving?) until the end of the year. Â Strangely, it's the same $84 price for a single day and the Fun card. Â AAA membership got us a $6 discount on that!Tip, I just saw the year membership (I think also only good 'til end of year, not for 365 days) at Costco for $114. Â This includes free parking (parking is $12 now, I think), whereas the Fun Card does NOT. Â Also more discounts on bringing friends, buying tours, food, and merchandise. Â So get at least ONE of these, and Fun Cards for others since you only need one person with a free parking pass and/or discounts.We had a great time. Â I advise getting tickets online or ahead of time as the line to get them is fairly long, even early (we got there just about 10am when they opened).If you like the rides as I do, go EARLY and do them then, OR, stay late to do them. Â Often you can practically walk on, at least on weekdays. Â Come summer, the lines will be even longer. Â I enjoyed the Manta, smooth and fast, but over before you know it! Â Wheeeee!We did the noon Shamu show, it was wonderful! Â Many have heard about or seen the blackfish movie. Â After hearing about it a lot, I finally watched it. Â I was surprised that while it came across as a documentary, it was mainly a propoganda piece against Sea World with very old information (1990s?) orca and other animal treatment commentary and out of context statements from former employees. Â This is not to say there aren't improvements that might still be made, but do your own research before convicting Sea World of animal abuse.Frankly, I missed the parts of the show where the trainers ARE in the water. Â I especially remember the part where the person dives in and they come up on the nose of the whale at the same time.Oh, and if it's a hot day and you want to get splashed, you WILL! Â And the water is cold, cold, cold! Â  But fun anyway, just protect your cameras and cell phones.We saw the dolphins being fed and playing, jumping, chasing each other and even got in a touch at one point. Â They are FAST! Also did the Dolphin show, very fun. Â Personally, I'd like more of the dolphins, or only the dolphins, and less of the people stunts into the pool by themselves. Â It was very well done, but I'm there to see animals, not people performers. Â That being said, I suspect the kids really like the whole extravaganza so if you have kids, keep that in mind.We also saw the aquarium with endangered turtles and other life galore.Then the shark exhibit where you go through a tube INSIDE and UNDERNEATH the sharks swimming all around! Â I love that one.Last show we saw was the Pets show, where most of the cats, dogs, pig, birds, and more are rescues! Â Lots of fun, amazing what they do and can do, even without prompting from the trainers. Â Who says you can't train a cat?!? Â :) Â I think this is my favorite show because of the rescues.Beautiful park, we didn't partake of the food but you can pay a set price and get as much food as you want (one plate per visit through the line). Â Probably well worth it if you'll be there all day, especially during longer summer hours.Hope all this is helpful!"
1185,12/16/2017,1,"Seaworld is dead to me. We had the misfortune of visiting during this past Thanksgiving week. It was a disaster. It is apparent that Seaworld has the upmost disrespect for its paying customers. Things start very badly in the morning. On the day we visited, the park was supposed to open at 10 AM. So we thought, let's get to the parking lot some 20 min. early. Surely, as any other park does (Legoland for example), they would let people park in advance of the opening hour. But no, not Seaworld. You can't even get to the parking before opening. Actually, not until 10:10 AM--yes, 10 min. later than opening hour they opened the parking lot gates. So you would think we could just go in. No, wrong again. This time, they didn't let people in until around 10:20 AM. Why? Nobody knows, nobody gave any explanation. Well, you already paid for the ticket. Once inside, you would think that's it. But NOOOOO. They kept everybody confined to the entrance area until about 11:05. There's NOTHING, and mean NOTHING remotely interesting in this area, and it's not clear why they wouldn't let people wander around the park. OK, so once in, what's there to see? I will tell you. The only--really the only--thing worth seeing at Seaworld is the orca show. Now, this has been tamed and is not nearly as good as it was before. It's still interesting to watch once in a lifetime, but you have to think whether 15 minutes of watching orcas swim in a tank is worth the asking price. Besides that, there is absolutely nothing else that is worth the trip. The food was predictably awful and way overpriced. And the whole time speakers blared Christmas carols. Think about it--the whole time!At the end of the day, they advertised the ""Christmas show"". It turned out to be a utterly boring, religiously-themed sequence of songs. Our family did not appreciate it. Needless to say, we will not return."
1186,1/12/2014,3,"Vacationing in San Diego? Â Check out its SeaWorld park if you like to see sea creatures.Shamu is probably the most famous SeaWorld resident @ the park. Â My favorite is Penguins Up-Close Tour and Pets Rule! Â I also enjoy going to Aquaria: World of Fishes; I don't get tired of watching them swim. Â Very peaceful and relaxing.There are many kids attractions such as: Magadascar Live! Operation: Vacation, Sesame Street Bay of Play, Elmo's Flying Fish and Abby's Sea Star Spin.Tickets price on their website right now:Single day SeaWorld ticket: $84.00 for adult and $78.00 for child from 3-9.SeaWorld + San Diego Zoo + Safari Park combo ticket: $149.00 for adult and $119.00 for child from 3-9.SeaWorld + Universal Studio Combo ticket: $142.00 for adult and $134.00 for child 3-9.2014 Southern California City Pass: $328.00 for adult and $284.00 for child 3-9.Online promotion:2014 Fun Card: pay for a day, play all year. $84.00 admission until December 31, 2014.3 stars!!"
1187,5/30/2012,4,"AHHHHHHH! I love aquatic animals. Â They're fun to watch as well as imagine on a plate with some clarified butter.For a whopping $73, one could purchase basically a full year pass! Â The fun pass is definitely worth the buy, since $73 is a day ticket, it only made sense to just opt for the fun pass!A few water rides, some ""ok"" eateries, but lots of things to see and do!"
1188,8/23/2016,5,Absolutely love coming here. Everyone is always so friendly and we love how clean it is! I love all the rescue and rehabilitation that this place does and am proud to say I stand with SeaWorld! Thanks for taking care of our animals and our planet
1189,12/26/2017,5,Seaworld is beautiful. Â The Orca encounter teaches you so much about the killer whales. Â Getting to see one up close is spectacular. Â The dolphin show was great too. My favorite show was the Sea Lions. They are so funny and cute. Â The Christmas Nativity Show is filled with brainchild songs and has so many animals. Â I loved the Camel!
1190,2/16/2012,4,"Spotted outside the entrance of SeaWorld as we left the premises for the day, passing by the discounted made in China old out of style SW imprinted merchandise past the exit (yeah $10 for a ""cheaper"" overstock $hamu plushie or t-shirt ain't exactly a $teal)...SeaWorld logo painted VW Beetle!$hamu on wheel$!Me want. Can I haz it fo ten dolla?"
1191,11/18/2017,1,"Came today 11/18/17 and hd a reasonably good time, but the place was really empty and a lot of rides were not working due to that, nor were many stations for food or drinks open for the same reason, and we had to walk distances, without direction, to find places to buy things from. Moreover, at the end upon exiting, I decided to buy a cotton candy for my little girl and the lady nicely asked if I had a yearly pass to get 10% off. I was a bit thrown off because I had bought things all day and no one ever asked for my yearly pass, which I purchased this very morning at $10 more than the one-day pass (it made sense). I go to Guest Services, not to complain, but simply to let them know that park employees are not asking guests if they have a yearly pass, saving them 10%, and enticing park visitors to come back again more often. The lady, Sandie, at Guest Services gets all defensive and blames it on me, telling me I should know to ask if I get a discount for being a yearly pass holder, saying park employees are not even encouraged to promote the idea to guests. Wow! I was shocked and THAT was the reason I even decided to leave this review. So sad that this lady would blame a park goer, instead of being business savvy and realizing that what I am saying actually makes sense and I refuse to believe SeaWorld does not train their employees on this, giving more value to their annual passed. Terrible."
1192,8/29/2016,5,My family and I really enjoy coming to Sea World. We also cant wait to see they're future plans for the large whales and other attractions. Â Prices are good in my opinion. Â Also VIP parking is a awesome option.
1193,1/1/2014,1,"If I could give it negative stars I would. Sooo many things have changed in the five years since I have last attended sea world San Diego. Aside from the obvious(the captivity of shamu and dolphins)-15 dollar parking-ridiculous lines- Extremely overpriced tickets Not one thing has changed for the better. Many aquariums are down to add more children rides. The shamu show was horrible and was very ""campy"" . The trainers are no longer allowed in the water with the whales. THE Dophin show had more crappy circus performers than actual dophin action...extremely lame. The clydesdales are gone...beer school..gone....deep water aquarium gone...but hey ..they added a bunch of kid rides and watered down shows. Try the zoo instead. Its still very pleasant ...goodluck..oh yeah..animal torture."
1194,12/29/2013,2,"First, out front, the shows are pretty amazing. However, I kept thinking how do they make the whales, the orcas and the dolphins do those tricks - how are they treated? Are they taken good care of?. Waiting to see some reference from the trainers to the accusations, but sometimes not getting an answer is also an answer...I left the park in a hard feelings.I would suggest maybe going to a state water park where you can see sea lions, whales and dolphins out in the open sea."
1195,12/21/2013,1,"The parking is terrible, the food is overpriced, the rides are lame, and there are no educational activities anywhere for children. Â It's all mindless entertainment, watching animals being exploited and suffering for money. Â Which is really no surprise since Seaworld is owned by the Blackstone Group, a wall street private equity firm whose only concern is making money. Â So what if a few thousand beautiful, intelligent animals are miserable and suffering. Â There is money to be made! Â The orcas are kept in tiny bathtubs when in the wild they have the whole ocean. Â Seaworld likes to claim that they help animals, meanwhile they spend their money on building bigger roller coasters and more thrill rides. Â Saving a few hurt seagulls on the beach is good PR but it doesn't justify the cruel and inhumane captivity of orcas and many other creatures. Â Go to the marina next to sea world on mission bay early in the morning and you can hear the cries of misery from all of the animals. Â Knowing what we know now, it's shameful that Seaworld still keeps orcas in captivity. Â Please spend your money elsewhere if you want to see animals, go to the San Diego Safari Park where the animals have thousands of acres to roam, and they have educational activities for children to learn about the animals instead of exploiting them. Â  SHAME ON YOU SEAWORLD."
1196,11/8/2014,3,"Pros: the staffs were great in giving direction to reach the destination for the showsCons: map is difficult and take time to read, gifts giveaway in the shamu and dolphin shows is unfair"
1197,4/15/2015,3,"Nothing spectacular. Would be a good place to check out if you never been to any sea world. We spent a whole day at this place and checked out all the attractions. Same old sea creatures you would see any other zoo. I was expecting to see some rare species, but that remained a wish that never came true. At any given day this place is super packed with tourists and annoying kids which makes the experience less desirable. There was not a single time I was able to quietly observe any species without getting bumped and interrupted by kids and annoying tourists."
1198,7/18/2014,4,"Woo this place is a bit over priced. We bought the online ticket for weekdays for $50 but if you pay at the park, it'll be $84! smh too expensive. Anyways, if you go, you have to see ALL the show, like EVERY SINGLE SHOW, and yes BRING SUNSCREEN! everyshow is outdoor and there is NO SHADES at all. I got severely burned for watching the orca show because I didn't know that everything's outdoor :( LOLThey don't have that animal exhibits however. The penguine exhibit was pretty big and funny - a good place to have some rest and enjoy some cool air in the middle of the day."
1199,8/26/2014,5,"We have yearly passes and have had so for almost 5 years. I love this place. It's basically our go-to theme park when we want to get out of the house. I love the little cleaner fish that are in the tanks as soon as you come in the entrance. I feel like I'm getting a free manicure. My only complaint is that you can't stick your feet in there to get a pedicure as well...just kidding! Pets Rule is a great show to watch. Who doesn't love cute little pets doing amazing tricks? The best part is that all of the pets were rescued from local shelters. Suck on that one, PETA! All in all, SeaWorld is an amazing place. Yes, animals are kept in captivity. These animals are treated better than most people. They receive top notch medical care and are truly loved. SeaWorld does more for conservation than most people realize. But if you want to base your opinion off of one movie and the opinion of a guy who is known for stapling his naughty bits to his butt, then go ahead."
1200,11/8/2014,5,"Wow! Â Amazing day. The park was not packed which was a nice perk for us. The park was very balanced between exhibits, shows and rides."
1201,5/19/2016,5,Love Sea World. I hate all of the people that ignore all they do for animals and the awareness they have brought to orcas and others. It is a shame they will be discontinuing the Shamu show to appease hashtag activists. I take my 2 yo daughter here probably twice a month.
1202,8/20/2016,5,"Been living in Pacific beach for the past 12 years, friends and family love to visit the park. Love the evening fireworks.... That's San Diego."
1203,11/9/2014,4,"Celebrated my 30th birthday in San Diego and decided to relive my childhood at Sea World. My friends and I enjoyed a few of the shows and animals. But, to be honest the best part was of course petting the Manta Rays and riding the Manta roller coaster... hands down. The rays are one of my favorite animal encounters, at sea world. We had a new born baby with us and I was once again amazed at the fact that you can just leave your stroller by itself, and all of your stuff will still be there when you return. Amazing! No matter your views on Sea World, it is an amazing educational resource and because of them, a lot of research on ocean animals has been able to take place. I like it!"
1204,2/19/2012,5,"Great place to take kids/visitors to. If you live in the region, get an annual pass. If you plan on going there at least 4 times a year, get a Silver Pass, or parking fees will make you wish you did. Show your pass to get discounts at the shops/restaurants, etc.I paid $155 for a 2-year Silver Pass (renewal). Beat that, Disneyland!"
1205,8/31/2016,5,Shows were great! Burger and drinks were good! Rides were awesome!Great time for young and old!
1206,2/23/2014,5,My Husband & I had the most wonderful & fun time ever!..the rides were Amazing! As was all the shows we took in.for it to be a Saturday the lines were not so bad.we had Pizza and Salad @ Some place called Pizza Kitchen it was very spend & just ok. In fact it sent us both to the restroom within Minutes.
1207,6/10/2017,5,"My family and I had an amazing time here. I was a little upset that after the backlash they received from the Blackfish documentary and forced them to end the Shamu Show. My wife was even hesitant of taking the kids based on the documentary. Once we got there and saw a few animals, got on a few rides and saw the overall theme of the park was to show that they do care about animals and that they treat and nurture them and study them, her attitude towards the place was completely turned around. She loved it here and could not be happier with our experience there. We saw the new educational Orca show first and it was nice to learn about them and watch them splash us and teach us what they do and how they do it. We also saw the dolphin show and the sea lion show and those were awesome as well. The sea lion one was full of laughs and had great comedy for everyone. We went on a Thursday in June and there was hardly any wait on most of the rides and the staff was very helpful when it came to the child/parent swap lines since we had a baby with us. Overall it was a great experience and we will be going back again for sure!!!!"
1208,1/2/2015,4,"Had a Christmas party at seaworld, great price and the buffet was awesome. Can't beat 15 dollars for all day at seaworld and food. Rode the roller coaster 9 times and loved it. Only downside is the shamu show isn't as great as it used to be. But all the other be attractions and shows are a must see."
1209,3/27/2014,5,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!Talk about a jump back to being a kid! Â I love the shows and the animals so much!! Â I can't get over how beautiful it is here and how great they treat the animals.The Shamu show was something else, they even do a tribute to the armed forces before the show. Â Just shows a high level of class in today's world. Â There is no hidden agenda by doing it, they just say thank you for your service. Â Awesome! Â Thank YOU Sea World!The Clyde and Seymour show is a MUST!! Too funny!!! Â The staff look like they are having a GREAT time and really love what they do!! Â Hope you get Jorge and Kelly in the show when you go!!The dolphin show, WOW!! Talk about amazing show!! Â Tiffany is the best performer in the show and boy does she show it!!! It's pretty impressive I will say!!The whole park is great and there is so much to do!! Â Just take the day and wonder!!"
1210,12/22/2013,5,"AwesomeMy daughter walked my butt off yesterday, dragging me from show to show. Â I think we did them all and still managed to let me have a turkey leg along the way! Â She is a huge animal lover, and believes I should have at least one pet of every kind in the house. Â Not sure where to put Shamu though...I think we enjoyed the Shamu show the best, followed be the seals, dolphins and doggies. Â The dolphins could have been number one, if they wouldn't have spent more time with divers than dolphins, also too much going on at once. Â By far the best thing for us was a dolphin pool, that is where they were just swimming around playing with the balls and playing with the people standing there. It is an expensive day. Â For my 8 year old and me, it approached $220. About what you would spend at Disneyland these days. Â But, for my little one, she would rather be here than at Disneyland. Â Good thing I bought the annual pass! Â  Anyone know where I can get a 500,000 gallon fish tank for home?"
1211,3/27/2014,3,"Was a bit leery of coming here, especially after watching ""Blackfish"" but I decided to go anyway. The animal exhibits are good and I especially love the penguins. The Artic ride really needs to be updated. It evokes fond memories of rides back when I was a young'un in the early 90's. The simulation also was tacky.The water rides were fine; your standard water/log type deals although I remember the Atlantis ride being better at the Orlando park.The food prices, while high, were to be expected. We bought one of those all day all you can eat bracelets for $30 which would be worth it if you plan on eating more than one and a half times. I was disappointed that there were no real sit down restaurants or maybe I missed them?The dolphin ride was a bit perplexing. The pilot whale/macaw/dolphin combo might have worked better if the macaw actually flew around more than once. I felt like a lot of the spectacle was just trying to fill time and I found myself becoming impatient. I would have liked to see or at least LEARN more about the animals, especially the pilot whales. I don't know anything about them.The day we went the lines were not terrible at all. We went on a Monday and it was mostly cloudy and cool. We never waited more than 20 minutes, tops. The Manta ride was great fun and we went on twice...the second time we got stuck. Earlier in the day the ride was out of commission as well for other problems that weren't discussed. Its' a pity a new ride was having issues. The polar bears were not there when we went either for some reason, which was unfortunate."
1212,12/23/2017,1,"I think Seaworld is abusive and I only went there once. They treat the animals like crap and the dolphin Christmas special is not really a dolphin Christmas special. The dolphins only know how to do a few tricks and there is no such thing as training them to do brand new, unrecognizable tricks. The rides are so lame and boring there's only the Bayside Skyride to go on which is the only reason why I'm giving it a 1 star rating. The parking is very expensive ($17) and the tickets cost a ton of money. So if you want to spend big bucks and get ripped off, this is the place to go to. I highly recommend that you do not go there."
1213,9/4/2016,5,We go several times a year. Â My kids love coming here and spending the day with the animals. Â We will miss the Shamu show. Â Too many haters in the world.
1214,5/7/2014,4,Wow!It was amazing so special !You will defiantly need to spend full day over there Â but do it! Take every one with you so fun . LOL
1215,11/4/2013,1,"So Yelp removed my review of Sea World because it was ""ideological"" and not based on my experience of the park. So here's another review about my experience: the parking is terrible, the food is overpriced and bad, the tour guides are uninformed and the big fish shows are sad and depressing. I think it says a lot about Sea World that they are combing through reviews and having Yelp remove negative comments about their business practices. How about change your practices instead of trying to drum up good PR?"
1216,11/12/2012,3,"Sea World has definitely changed A LOT since my last visit, which was probably oh, I don't know, over 15 years ago?First off, RIDES! Back then, there were zero rides and now there are 4 or 5. Manta was really fun, but pretty short. I read some reviews and for some reason I thought the ride went through an aquarium (in those glass tunnel things), but no. It was the first attraction I headed to and there was no line. Journey to Atlantis is kind of like a combination log ride and roller coaster. The scariest part for me was the elevator ride! Then there's Wild Arctic which has been there for a while and is one of those motion simulator things. It's ok, but not worth a wait. The longest wait of the day was for Shipwreck Rapids despite it being overcast. We waited about 30 minutes and got SOAKED. You will definitely get wet. When we got off, the line had completely disappeared lol.The shows are also different from before. I know they've gotten some bad press with injured animals and trainers, so there is more of a story/acrobatic element to them. The trainers no longer get in the water with killer whales and instead just sort of dance around the side of the tank. They do get in with the dolphins, but now that show also has birds, acrobats and music. It's fun and all, but with the combination of sitting, heat and sun, I saw my teenage cousins using the shows as an opportunity for a nap.I think the biggest hit of the day with my visiting relatives from Japan were the funnel cakes. We also went a bit nuts in the ""Everything $9.99 and Under"" store. It's like a Sea World outlet shop and I picked up a robe for less than $10! Sea World was fun, but like the Safari Park, I probably won't be coming back for a while."
1217,12/15/2013,3,"Best time to come here: Summer (that's a no-brainer)How often should a person come here: Not once a decade (like me)How much fun this place is: Lots, especially to the kids. Some attractions may not appeal much to adultsHow expensive: Fairly (close to 100 clams just to get in. Add ons cost extra, like socializing with animals or getting in front of lines)Length of Lines: Decent, but aggravated by the blistering heatRides that were awesome: The Manta. Lines were not terrible. Decent part of line was in the shade. Ride lasted long enough to be worth while. 4 out of 5 screams.Ride that will get you drenched (in a fun way): Shipwreck Rapids. The water will get you. Don't live in the illusion that you will evade getting wet. YOU WILL GET WET. It gets worse when onlookers can pay to aim and shoot water cannons at you when your raft passes by. I shook my fist harder at them as they aimed at me with glee.Animal exhibits of note: The Mantas were awesome. So were the Polar bears (one was just basking in the sun while he slept). Of course, the highlights were the dolphin and killer whale shows. The trainers do ride them, and that's what I remember seeing. Guess things are okay now and the bad press about trainers getting hurt or dying during show stunts have died down. They are not joking or kidding about the splash zones; YOU WILL GET WET IN THE SPLASH ZONES.Verdict: I wish this place was closer or cheaper. I don't mind the lines if the attractions I'm seeing are worth it. I don't mind the getting wet if it's fun. I don't mind the drive if I have something to show for it when I get back home. Ultimately, I actually like this place. I just can't do it often, and getting an annual pass only works if you're willing to do the drive. I'd love to come back here more than once a decade, but I wish the price and distance wasn't a variable."
1218,10/28/2013,1,Went here during summer 2013 and had a terrible experience. My main complaint was the inaccurate answers given by employees when questioned about the orcas. A simple google search provided more accurate information than the lies being told by the employees here.The entrance price is absurdly high when comparing to other aquariums( that are also more educational) and amusement parks. Do research before spending your hard earned money on this company.
1219,1/27/2014,2,"2.5 stars, for the record.Seaworld has certainly changed quite a bit since I've been here...it's been about 15 years since. Granted, my parents paid for me when I came as an 8 year old, but $84 for a single day adult ticket that doesn't even include parking (-1 star), you've got to be kidding. For the same price, at least Disneyland still had some of its original charm. OR you could go to the San Diego Zoo, TWICE. Now that's a great place to spend a day in my opinion!A lot of the shows are now 80% inspirational music fluff and 20% animal performances (-1 star). Maybe it was just me, but I sort of remember the shows being more magical, but then again, I was 8. Honestly, the ""interactive"" games pre-show were more entertaining...assuming you have unlimited texting. The best show was probably the sea lion show, the klepto sea otter was hilarious (+0.5 stars)! For the swimming mammals, dolphins were definitely way more interesting than the killer whales, sadly. Food was expensive and not good either. I get that its theme park food and I mean, I pretty much expected BBQ sauce swiped onto a rack of ribs, but to find that I basically paid for a pile of bones was just not cool (-1 star). Because of how the shows are spaced out though, I didn't feel super rushed to get from point A to point B like I did at Disneyland. We had plenty of time to spare after waiting 45 minutes for the Manta ride...basically the only ride worth riding at SeaWorld.Doesn't affect my review, but I just have to put it out there: I see a lot of recent reviews are slamming SeaWorld in reference to the documentary Blackfish...to which SeaWorld now has a whole page dedicated to ""defending"" itself against the film....but it's really just nit-picking all the little segments of the movie and discrediting the past workers and researchers as people unfamiliar with the practices of SeaWorld or their related scientific field....um, kind of passive aggressive and naive if you ask me."
1220,1/8/2012,3,"I've been to both the Sea World in Florida and to this one. Â I remember coming to the San Diego one in about 1998 and was amazed. Â I remember loving all the shows as a kid. Â I remember them being excited and nothing but animals doing tricks. Â I must admit, I was a bit disappointed coming back as an adult. Â Even my mother, who was with me at all the times we went to Sea World from the mid-80s on, commented on how Sea World isn't quite what it used to be.Now every time you leave an exhibit (sharks, penguins, etc.) you have to go through a store. Â While I understand this is a commercial enterprise, sometimes it's really frustrating. Â Sometimes I just wanted to leave and go see something else, but convincing a kid to pass by the store and not browse isn't always easy - but even by the end of the day she stopped caring about the stores. Â It's also frustrating as the stores get busy and you have to fight your way through (as if the crowds in the exhibits aren't bad enough). Â Parking is expensive. Â There are way more rides here than there used to be. Â I think Sea World wants to be more of a theme park than it is. Â The whole center area is closed off right now as they're building a big roller coaster. Â That means you have to walk all around to get through the park, it's a bit annoying. Â I'm going to guess that's where the rays are since I didn't see them anywhere else. Â The food is not so great. Â The only ride I went on was Riptide Rescue. Â I wouldn't recommend if the line is very long. Â It was ok, but nothing you wouldn't normally find at a fair or something.Well that is unless you count Wild Arctic as a ride. Â It's one of those things where you watch a video and the chairs move with the video. Â After the ""ride"" you can go look at the Beluga whales, walruses, and polar bears. Â Unless you really want to go on the ride, I'd suggest skipping the ride and just walking into the exhibit. Â One Ocean (current Shamu show) was mediocre. Â The trainers no longer get into the water with the whales. Â I was unimpressed and though there was way too much talking. Â The show also seemed really short.Blue Horizons (dolphin show) was disappointing to say the least. Â I felt like I spent more time watching acrobatics by trainers and diving by people than I did dolphins. Â The turtle exhibit, shark exhibit, and penguin exhibit were all extremely crowded and exactly what I remember as a kid. Â I love the moving sidewalk through tubes with the penguins & sharks, but I feel like it could be updated somehow. Â The aquarium is a bit sad. Â For being Sea World, I would have expected more than just little tanks and little fishes. Â And there were a lot of rude people in there pushing and shoving to see the tanks since only 2 people can really look at a time.I was disappointed since the dolphin feeding area was closed for the day. Â We fed the sea lions and seals, but it's not as cool as the dolphins since you can't touch them. Â Beware of the birds as they are *really* aggressive and one even snagged a fish out of my step-daughters hand (though clearly no fault to Sea World for that). Â Overall, if you've never been to Sea World, definitely go at least once! Â If you were there as a kid or a number of years ago, it's still fun, but nowhere near what you probably remember it as. Â It's definitely not somewhere I think I'd want to go all the time if I lived nearby, but I did enjoy my day at the park."
1221,9/26/2014,4,"I haven't been here since I was younger and I had an amazing experience! The staff here are friendly.The shows were great, just get there early for good seats. Just remember to wear and bring sunscreen! The dolphin encounter was fun. You get to see the dolphins up close and take pictures of them. the shark exhibit was one of my favorites with the baby sharks. Don't forget to ride the rides to cool off!"
1222,7/17/2017,5,"I love seaworld. All the employees are so friendly and helpful! The dolphin interaction program is a must if you love dolphins, it is so fun. The prices are great for a ticket and they always have so many offers like get the rest of the year free or come back a second day for only 10$. It is one of the cheapest places to go now and have fun! The food is a little over priced but they allow you to bring i food and water which is a plus. There are so many fun shows and exhibits to see. They even have plenty of rides for little ones and adults!"
1223,11/13/2013,3,"We got some tickets from my husband's aunt as a gift, which was very exciting. Â We went on a Saturday and were super excited to go and *sea* some animals! We saw a few of the visiting animals (porcupines, anteaters, nothing crazy)Then we saw some sharks. The walk through is really cool, because there are sharks above you, on the side of you, just everywhere. Â If you are afraid of sharks, I would recommend skipping the shark exhibit.We saw the penguins, which was so much fun! I could have watched them for hours.They looked a little cramped though! :(We went on the Manta Ray, which was actually pretty fun and worth a ride or two.We pet some manta rays, and THEY WERE SO CUTE! They come up to you like a little puppy and like being pet (because they think you have food). Â You can buy food to feed to them.The seals were very cool. Â I was about 3 feet away from one of them, eye-to-eye. Â You can feed them as well.We saw the following shows: Shamu, Dolphin/Bird, Seal/Otter. Â My favorite was actually the Seal one! It was funnyish (Biff - hate to admit he gave me a laugh) and I never knew that seals could do all those tricks! Â Shamu was great, but the whales just looked kind of sad to me. Â The dolphin and bird show was more like a Cirque de Soleis thing than a trick show, which was a nice surprise.I snuck some food into the park in my purse, so I can't comment on the food.For those of you who are bothered by children/strollers, I would not advise ever coming here. Â I like kids, but this place made me hate them a little. Â I got the chance to pet a dolphin, which was AWESOME (life dream)! But, understandably, there were kids trying to push me out of the way to pet the dolphin and parents giving me dirty looks for not sacrificing my spot. Â I may have a few more birthdays under my belt, but I still want to pet sea creatures. Back off kids!If you are visiting San Diego and looking to see some animals, I would suggest you spend your money at the San Diego zoo. Â You'll see more animals there and it's more impressive!"
1224,3/24/2014,5,Great park. We come here ones every couple months but now the shamu show was a little boring no more trainers inside the water. The dolphin show is the best one right now. Overall a great park.
1225,6/15/2012,4,"Who doesn't have fun at Sea World? I remember going often as a kid, so I was very excited to take another visit now that I am older.Overall experience? Very fun.The Shamu show was great. The sea lion show was very similar to what I remembered seeing back in '92.. so not much has changed. The dolphin show was more of the trainers dancing than seeing the actual dolphins.The food was extremely overpriced (as most theme parks) and was decent.They no longer allow the guests to feed the dolphins! I don't know exactly when this happened, but it was the 1 thing I was looking forward to.. but we tried to touch them in the dolphin interaction zone anyway.. Not much luck with that due to the crowds of people and the staff asking people to move to the back (quite rude actually..)LOVED the shark zone. The penguins were also very cool to see.On a side note.. if anyone is traveling up from the Orange County area on the 5 south, be sure to take a stop at Vista Point. It is a very small turn off literally called ""Vista Point"". Has a great view of the ocean for pictures, but above that there are little squirrels that are very friendly and come right up to you. Perfect to stop off with kids!"
1226,2/25/2016,1,"Nothing new added in half a decade. Six years ago was the last time I've visited. Absolutely nothing substantial has been added to the park. In fact, the shows are shorter, the food is just as bad but pricier, and ticket prices are exorbitant now. Do yourself a favor, go to the San Diego zoo instead, you will see happier animals and greater variety. The one or two rides here are basically nothing. This is not that type of amusement park. For the same price as admission to this horrid place, you can spend half a day at the San Diego zoo and see a world class zoo then take a taxi to Belmont Park for some actually decent rides,"
1227,11/26/2017,5,I was against sea world after blackfish however I ended up going for the first time and fell in love. Also found out that sea world does so much to help out the environment and animals all over. The park itself is amazing I was extremely surprised at how fast/fun manta their rollercoaster was and our kids love playing in the kids zone. We now have season passes and plan to every year.
1228,12/30/2013,5,"Love it and headed there now. My kids are 3 & 5 y/o and always have a blast. The shows are amazing and the trainers and workers do an excellent job. I wish it were less expensive, but for the price thru my union it is well worth it. We come frequently throughout the year and we always get great seats at the shows and the lines for the rides are never long in comparison to Legoland, Disneyland and Magic Mountain. I know people and animal rights activist are always complaining about the way the animals are treated especially since that movie came out. These people are probably vegetarians and vegans anyway. There are 2 sides to the story and the complainers won't be happy until the animals are all in the middle of the ocean. Quite frankly, I don't want to have to go to the middle of the ocean to see some whales. I'm happy they are at Sea World. I've never seen the animals bleeding or sickly looking. The bottom line is humans were given dominion over animals and if they have to do a trick for some fish there's nothing wrong with that. I've got to work for money and they should do a trick for fish. It's Â called life people. Plus its cool. If you have a problem with Sea World and your perception of how the animals are being treated then don't go. It's really just that simple."
1229,8/26/2014,4,"I had such a blast here! Any ocean life = big smiles (also makes me wish I followed through with Marine Biology), especially Dolphins. All of the Shows were fantastic, especially the whales, sea lions, and Dolphins. All the exhibits were really neat, and interactive. We got here right as they opened, and stayed all day, without getting bored once. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is because the dolphin show was shut down that day,so next time I hope to have better luck! Completely agree on the sun screen tip, it was cloudy all day, and I still got major sunburn, so slather it on, or have lobster status the next few days!! Â I also couldn't resist the huge stuffed dolphin I bought, since the workers wouldn't budge on letting me have a real one ;)"
1230,4/6/2016,2,"In my recent experience this park is not worthThe expense nor time. I want to recommend everyone check park hours well in advance as to avoid having my same experience. Pros - the animals, park grounds kept relatively clean overall, and the restaurant food was edible for theme park food. Yet Expensive!Kids play area is huge and colorful. Good for older kids.Cute rides for little kids with sesame theme.Touch pools were cool- You can pet a shark!! CONS= THEME PARK CLOSES AT 5 PM ??!!!!  Â  Â  Â  Â  Ridiculously early closing time. This Does not allow enough time to enjoy the park fully. If you get there in the afternoon it is for the most part a wasted scramble of a day. Families beware if you know your kids need extra time or actually want to see the attractions or animal exhibits for more than 30 seconds each. If you think the all day dining deal is a deal, think again. Â We Paid extra and was impossible to fully use the "" deal"" since once again the park closes at 5pm! Â So get ready to shove a complete meal in your face and your kids face at top speed and rush to "" experience"" the next attraction for 30 seconds and sprint around trying to not get lost since there is little time to fumble around with maps or directions when you are in a rush.Staff members helpfulness was 50/50.Restaurants helpful, guest services and front desk not so much. Restrooms are hard to find so again it makes Â the day even more frustrating.  The kids play area is huge and kind of scary for little ones and for parents worried about younger Â lost child in this chaos or injuries. One staff person allocated to watching two VERY active play areas ( one with heavy swinging columns ) at same time..I use the term "" watching "" loosely in this case. So parents, as always, obviously use at own risk and stay alert. There is some kind of sewage or dead fish smell coming from the kids water play area. Scary and putrid. Yuck!I cannot comment on any rides because we had no time to wait in line for them. Â Frustrating.We arrived at Sea World on our last vacation day. I purchased tickets online and never checked closing times because I don't think most people expect a park that charges this much money would close so early. You should at least charge less on days that close so early. I love animals and was looking forward to Sea world but I'm sorry to say the experience was not a good one. Nor can I recommend that it is worth the overall prices plus parking. I do not see how a family can enjoy the entire park in such a short amount of time. $130+ per person ( food pass) Plus parking!!! For 4 1/2 hrs of rushing around and just time enough for one mediocre theme park food meal. Â No time for shows ( many were closed ) no time for rides or long lines ,except the few sesame St kids rides. Thankfully they kept those moving.Hidden restrooms and confusing signs. Much of the staff seemed indifferent or unhappy .Honestly the sight of the holding tank in back of orca exhibit with so many large whales seemed very crowded and sad sight to see.Disappointed. Sorry Sea World, but we won't be back.The zoo for us was far more worth it.2 1/2 stars"
1231,4/4/2016,2,"This is not the place to learn about sea creatures.It is 30 percent sea life, 70 percent amusement park. Wait, let me correct that - it's amusing if you are NOT a roller coaster aficionado and consider $10 for three chances to win a gaudy stuffed animal to be amusement. Â  As for the sea life - there Â were dolphins, killer whales, manta rays Â flamingos (err), a dog show,(??) Â a frog exhibit,(hmm) Â a travelling bubble maker (whatever) Â - guess there's not much sea life in California! Â Oh - and don't put that wallet away just yet Â - it's $15-20 to park, $84 for the ticket, $6 to feed the manta rays, $5 to dry yourself after getting wet on the rides, $1.50 for the lockers."
1232,7/29/2016,3,"Overall Seaworld is a place we have loved for years, but with Seaworld bowing to animal activists and getting rid of a lot of good entertainment making way for videos and just a few tricks, the price is starting to be unjustified. Members for years but probably not much longer"
1233,12/1/2014,5,So much fun. Go see those dolphins and whales because otherwise your trip is a total waste. They are without a doubt my favourite animals by far- would own one or two as a pet if I could- and they just stole another piece of my heart which I didn't think was possible.
1234,11/23/2013,4,"My 200th review. It's taken 4+ years, but hey, I believe in quality, not quantity. You gotta see Shamu. But my wife loves the Blue Horizons. And I'm a sucker for Clyde and Seymour, especially when they spoof the other shows.This is a must if you're ever in San Diego."
1235,8/2/2014,5,"My husband took me to SeaWorld for our first date in San Diego and man oh man it was so much fun! We got to watch every show, ate so much delicious food, and enjoyed seeing the animals. The staff there was so helpful and cheery! I love the pet show the most! It was so energetic and I loved meeting the animals afterwards. If you need a good place to eat while visiting SeaWorld go check out the barbecue places. To die for!"
1236,6/18/2012,4,"My husband and I visited SeaWorld last Sunday to redeem our free park tickets for participating in the Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon. I've been to SeaWorld a dozen plus times over the years, but oddly enough do not have any recollection of past visits. Perhaps my brain is suppressing a particularly traumatic memory like, a rough encounter with a stingray, or something. I'm definitely more of a Disneyland girl at heart. My dad likes to tell my husband how much the cost of admission to SeaWorld was in the '80s ($10) and how he and my mom would take me, a fussy 6 month old, to SeaWorld in hopes that the sight of Shamu might pacify me (nope, it didn't). Â Anyway, my husband and I had a great time! We spectated four captivating and entertaining shows: Sea Lions LIVE, Blue Horizons, Cirque de la Mer, and One Ocean. We got an up-close and personal look at three exhibits: Shark Encounter, Pacific Point, and Freshwater Aquarium. We rode on the newly-opened ride Manta, which did not fail to thrill us and if the line wasn't so ridiculously long we probably would have stood in line for round two. We feasted on salmon, beef, French fries, and red velvet cake at Shipwreck Reef Cafe, which was not outrageously expensive and tasted fairly decent (for amusement park food). Upsides: My favorite show was Sea Lions LIVE, which was incredibly silly. The trainers and sea lions spoofed TV and music acts. My favorite was the spoof of Dancing With The Stars. Have you ever seen a sea lion tango? The Freshwater Aquarium was cool and my husband and I laughed at the electric eel. C'mon, electric eels are funny! Â  true-wildlife.blogspot.câ€¦Downsides: Parking cost $14!! Ridiculous! And I had to step out of line for Manta to rent a locker to store my purse. Luckily the rental cost was free (for the first hour anyway). Otherwise it was a wonderful afternoon."
1237,9/8/2013,1,"It was a very sad place and painful to see these beautiful creatures in such tight captivity. To see such huge mammals (dolphins, beluga whales and killer whales) in such small tanks and in captivity is utterly heartbreaking. All the whales fins are curved and yes it is remarkable that they can train them, but it is just not natural or fair. Let them go. Even my 7 year old child said to me, 'mom it doesn't seem like they have much space to swim'. The only reason we went is because their grandparents bought tickets and insisted we all go together. That will be the 1st and last time we visit SeaWorld. I am now going to watch this documentary called BLACKFISH."
1238,10/23/2013,4,"I had a hard time finding info on the kennel services since there is no direct phone line. Â But through email, here's what I found out:- No reservations allowed, first come, first serve basis only- Pets are not directly monitored, however, there is staff in a booth right next to the kennels.- They provide water, you provide the bowl, food, toys, etc.- There are about 12 large covered Â kennels available and can accomodate 2 dogs inside Â  each. Â - You can visit your dog/walk your dog whenever you want. Â A park staff member can arrange for you to get in contact with the kennel staff if needed.- The kennel opens a half hour prior to the park opening.- Off season, non-holiday or weekend shouldn't pose a problem, since it was empty when we went.- $10/day feeAltogether, it was really easy to use the kennel and the staff was friendly."
1239,12/3/2016,4,When I went to Sea World to spend a day I also took some notes and enjoyed the shows and noticed the customer service was very moderate yet it was good but it needed to better because when you have many areas please all guests.The service at the front gates needed to be Improved with the many lines that can have back up cashiers on wait or they can have customer service people directing people to those booths to get people into the park. Â  I had got into the main area of the customer service areas that when you get the hit with photo people that want to get you to your picture which is very expensive in price ranging up to 45.00 dollars.So I looked on the morning schedule to see what is the next shows so I saw it shamu stadium so I headed over that direction where I found places to sit and grabed a cold soda so I didn't hot .When I looked around there were many sellers that would walk through the crowd selling things yet it can be irritating. Â  Â So when I left the stadium and headed out and wanted to go and get some lunch so I headed over to the Paddock restaurant that has some very good beef sandwiches on good rolls with dipping sauce.This place can give you a chance to sit and relax because it has the Miller beer display how its made the whole process is very educational and if you have time you can go through and have a slice of Carrot Cake that is very good with cream cheese frosting. Â  Â  And with those that need help with wheel chairs you will have to pay a charge of 25 00 dollars which you dont see at the at the front of the of the INtroduction of the sea world comercial Â many dont when they walk through the front gate.When you go to Sea World just remember that with many that go early is go early also because lines get long you can get better service at customer service they can get you processed very quickly and take care of any reservations that you may need in the park for dinner.
1240,10/11/2015,1,"Me and my 3 children bought our passes through Costco. My husband still needed to buy his, so we allowed my son to bring his friend since it's ""kids free with paid adult"". Well obviously since we are residents, we are going to get the pay for a day play all year for the same price. Well, no one informed us that you can only pay for the day, not the year in order for the child to be free. What a complete scam! I thought Oct. kids free was to bring more californians to your establishment??? When I spoke with the manager, he was sooooo rude! He flat out lied after I told them their advertising is deceptive. He said it says right on the billboards that kids are free with a one day pass. B.S., it says ""kids are free with paid adult. Your customer service should be better then this considering how low your numbers are due to the Black fish movie and Peta. Shame on you, you ripped us off. I will not even use my tickets to come back here...ever! I will also never defend Sea World again from all of my animal lover friends.Customer service responded to my email and said that it says on their website that a child is free with an adult who pays for the day. HELLLLLOOOOO, IT DOESN'T SAY THAT ON YOUR HUGE BILLBOARD OFF THE I-5S!!!! I TRIED CALLING THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES, THEY DIDNT EVEN BOTHER CALLING BACK. DO YOU REALIZE HOW HORRIBLE YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS???? DO YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH IN JEAPORADY YOUR THEME-PARK IS IN??? I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD WORK ON YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, GOING TO GO WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY I HAVE AVOIDED WATCHING--BLACKFISH."
1241,7/18/2016,4,"Ok I love Sea World love the shows, would definitely recommend Cirque de del Mar very entertaining. Â  Just recently went their this weekend for a work appreciation party. Â  Â The only downside is that it does get very crowded during the summer. Â  Â But as long as y ou can deal with that, Â its worth a check out. Â  Â  Even got a shamu plush toy and a shamu vintage tea shirt. Â Blackfish? Â What blackfish?"
1242,10/3/2013,5,"I say that if you have to complain about expenses, then you really shouldn't be spending your money going to theme parks. Try going to Disneyland and see if you still think Sea World is ""outrageous"". You are going to a THEME PARK, of course it will be crowded, the world doesn't stop just because your family decides to go that day. People from all over the world plan months in advance for trips to come here, deal with it.There are alternatives to buying food, such as the All Day Dining Deal. Basically it's a one time payment of $35 for adults and $18 for children. You get to dine at all four of their biggest and best restaurants for as many times as you like.You also get free parking if you buy the ""Silver"" or ""Platinum"" membership, which pays for itself as that is $15-$20 you save every time you visit. You can even make payments and literally come for as long as Sea World exists, plus 10% off anything inside the park! Sounds like a deal to me, really.To be honest the new Shamu show is extremely corny, but if you have small children then you should definitely check it out. If not, the Dolphins are way more exciting to see. If you get there early enough, you can ride ALL the rides one after another with no line! My family does this every time we go, so please don't think that coming at 10am-12pm is a good idea. It's not.One thing to remember is to ALWAYS bring your ID if you have one, a few times my friends tried to redeem their tickets they could not do so without an ID. Same with order numbers of any kind. If you buy tickets online or have a voucher why would you walk in there blind? Bring everything with you and just put it back in your car when you're in the clear.The only thing I would have to call a negative would be the lack of updates on their exhibits. Take the Shark Encounter, it hasn't changed in the 5 years I've had a pass, which is disappointing. At least we get the new coaster Manta, it's awesome."
1243,7/18/2016,4,"Overall this is a good place to go and take the family. Â The shows were neat to watch and entertaining, although not always very educational. Â They have several places where you can pet various fish and animals.The reason I can't give 5 stars is because the animals have so little room in their enclosures. Â In the ocean they are used to swimming freely for miles and in SeaWorld have so little room for themselves. Â All they can do is swim around in circles, which is so sad to see.Also it's crazy busy with people everywhere, which is always annoying. Â And naturally food and water is really expensive as well-- take a lot of money with you!They have fireworks at night-- they literally last 5 minutes (we timed it) but they are still pretty and nice to see.Tip-- buy your tickets online or at your hotel to skip the lines at SeaWorld."
1244,2/5/2012,4,"We drive ALL the way from LA just to go here and even purchased annual passes. Â Compared to dland, it's totally affordable. Â The shows are pretty entertaining and love seeing all the sea creatures up close. Â They have a lot of different animals...polar bears, penguins, dolphins, sea lions, walruses,beluga whales, turtles, sharks, and of course shamu =) Â You can also feed the sea lions with purchased fish (~$4), but you have to be careful about the sea gulls and other birds. Â I think the only downside to this place are all the aggressive birds. Â You really have to watch out for your food. Â Also, the food here is not that great. Â If you purchase a souvenir cup, refills are 99 cents all day which is pretty nice and annual pass members get discounts at pretty much all the stands/food places/shops."
1245,10/23/2013,5,"We only spent like half the day here, but my son says he liked it better than Disneyland. I think I will remember that. Skip Disneyland next year and spend the day at SeaWorld. Way less expensive. Especially if you go in October and take advantage of the Kids Free San Diego promotion that happens every year. One child per paid adult ticket gets in for $Free.99. Parking is $15, I guess that is to be expected... So, okay I will probably take him to do both things... Who am I kidding. The kid is spoiled. But I definitely want to spend whole day here next time. We were rushing between shows and didn't get great seats because there are so many people... I definitely need to plan better next time. No rides for us at this park. It's all about the aminals. Really great day with my son here. Really great. He L O V E D the Beluga whales... They are really beautiful!"
1246,8/17/2014,5,"I love seaworld! Ever since I was little, it has always been a pleasure coming here. I really liked how they change up everything and added more color to it. I think this very visually appealing which is great. I am a teen and I still love the shows and all the exhibits. Although, the Shamu show seems scripted due to the dumb movie Blackfish, I still know the trainers genuinely care about these animals and it is apparent through the shows. Also, have I mentioned how clean the park is. Literally the cleanest theme park I have been too. Another pro about seaworld is it team members. I feel like they do like their job and do like helping out guests that needs it.Overall, seaworld is a great place and I love it. Cirque De La Mer is one of my favorite show. It is so creativeThank you seaworld! Keep doing your thing."
1247,9/16/2013,1,"Beware of ordering a 1 or 2 year annual pass thru their web site. The passes will auto renew on a monthly basis, and the only way to stop payment is to call SeaWorld. Â There are many people who think a 2 year pass is a 2 year pass. Â Sounds crazy hey? But Sea World is different from most, and unknown to us, they kept charging my credit card for a park pass we didn't even know we still had. We are attempting to get a refund for the months we did authorize them to charge our card, but so far, we are having to jump through hoops to get our own money back. They would not refund it over the phone and said I have to send them an email and they will review it...right, I am sure they will get right on this...If you have kids, go to Legoland, they are very family friendly, prices are not too high and they will not try to deceive their customers."
1248,3/30/2014,4,"-1 star just for feeling bad about coming here. visiting this place makes me feel guilty.ANYWAYS, I actually had a pretty great day despite sprinkling during a show. haven't been here in years so seeing the new revamped sea world was kind of exciting. the new roller coasters were really cool. the service at the park was friendly. I didn't enjoy one of the show's performers making fun of LA's gray skies (our skies are great, thanks). the parks decor was beautiful and the staff was very friendly."
1249,9/25/2016,5,Loved this place. Money and time well spent. Coming to this place and seeing all the different animals and seeing the shows made me my wife feel like kids again. Definitely coming back whenever we're in san diego :)
1250,4/15/2012,3,"I love SeaWorld, but I think it could use a little work. It's been pretty much the same for 10 years+ and I'm glad they're at least adding Manta Summer 2012 to add something new to the park. My favorite part was the Shamu ""One"" show.-edit after Manta rollercoaster-Lines we're way long for a really short ride. The ride was definitely fun, but not worth the over hour wait. Not sure how it is now, but probably in the summer it will always have an annoyingly long line -_-"
1251,2/9/2016,5,"We had a really good time with our kids. We all learned a lot about the animals. We were surprised to see that they had a giant playground and rides for the kids. We enjoyed the killer whale show and the kids thought it was cool how much and how far the whales can splash the water. The 4D show was really cute too. Overall, we all enjoyed our experience!"
1252,10/24/2013,3,"Has been over 10 years since my last visit. I say its okay to visit once, they do have many animals for my 5 years old to see and she was having a great time. However, after watching Blackfish, you really want to ask yourself if Shamu should belongs to the ocean or in a tank.When we saw the polar bear, he was just walking repeatedly back and forth, back and forth acting like losing his mind. I think he might be already insane being kept in a cage for such long time.I love to see wild animals, but place them where they belong to. And best luck to the ones in Sea World. Just like many other parks, Seaworld is pricey."
1253,7/10/2016,4,Great shows and a very friendly staff. Â We took advantage of the CA teacher program that give free tickets to teachers in CA. Â We also took advantage seeing the Killer Whales before they are not there anymore.
1254,12/9/2015,5,"Love the new water dispensers. It located by drinking fountains and you can refill you bottles with triple filtered water. Everything has been retrofitted to reduce waste. The bathrooms are super clean and there are breastfeeding rooms throughout the part. The breastfeeding rooms are a small room with lock located inside bathroom. The last time I was here there was two Shamu shows per day, now only one but they also have a killer whale preshow. Which is fine for me. The smokehouse Bbq brisket is really good."
1255,11/9/2015,1,"This place keeps animals in captivity and forces them to perform for people who have no clue what these animals are being put through! Open your eyes people !!!!!! STOP paying this corporation money to hurt and expose animals. Look up Dawn Brancheau's death, she was one of the most knowledgeable trainers at Seaworld and the whales viciously attacked, decapitated her, and finished killing her underwater! This park needs to be closed ASAP"
1256,2/23/2014,5,"Love this place! Got the year pass, great offer. Saw most of the shows. Too bad the trainers can swim with the killer whales anymore...RIP Dawn"
1257,6/19/2016,4,"I loved the SeaWorld Experience. Looking and learning about the different animals and watching them perform was truly amazing. The rides were also fun. The gift shops were reasonable and practical prices for a souvenir. I also loved the fact that the park itself was not crowded with smarms of people like at Disneyland. The only downsides is the park opens later and closes at 6pm. Kind of early, but I suppose the animals do need a rest from entertaining. Also we ate at the Mama Stella's Pizza Kitchen, and it was a complete waste of money. We stood in line for 40 min, only to determine what small portions for the amount of money paid. Our Â mozzarella sticks were not cooked all the way and the chicken Alfredo tasted like tuna. My brother ordered fries with his meal. The fries were overcooked, soggy and disgusting. If I ever come back- I am not eating at the Park until SeaWorld has more adequate food choices that are reasonable and actually tastes good & cooked all the way."
1258,6/30/2016,5,"To those who rate this award-winning aquarium because of a false-propaganda film. PLEASE do your research! SeaWorld receives the highest facility rating within the association of zoos and aquariums and it truly shows. Thank you for your education, conservation and rehabilitation of numerous animals. Also, I visit this park frequently to commend their efforts!"
1259,6/16/2014,4,"I took the family on a vacation to San Diego and we decided to visit Sea World. Â The prices for Sea World were ridiculous, but luckily military personnel and four guest get in for free, otherwise I would of payed $300 in tickets during the week.My kids loved the shows and all the animals, but we were done with the park in half a day."
1260,9/18/2013,2,"If you have basic cable, a decent sized TV and no kids, I'd say keep your $65 plus what you pay for parking and food or spend it on going north to one of the real theme parks like Disneyland, Universal Studios Hollywood or Six Flags Magic Mountain. Why? Because you can see the dolphins and the sharks and the penguins and whatever else is there in a well filmed documentary. Even their superstar showman killer whale Shamu's show is out of shape. The trainers used to swim with the killer whales but the Secretary of Labor's lawsuit against the park forced them to take the trainers out of the water which made the show at best ""above average"".The shark tube and the penguin walkway are things of the past and the park needs a major overhaul if it wants to capture the audience it used to have back in the 90s. The rides Manta and Journey to Atlantis are the only two things that are barely interesting. Food tasted bad, served cold and by people with attitude, not a smiling face. Will I go to SeaWorld again? Only to entertain visitors and even for that I need a lot of persuasion."
1261,7/5/2018,1,seaworld is complete bs. they have these animals in captivity. almost everything is fake. when they have shows they are about five minutes long and showtimes are two hours apart. all the food is trash. the only good thing about it is explorers cafe which i give five stars and they should open their own restaurant. food was extremely fast and it was so good we cried.
1262,1/5/2012,4,"SeaWorld is such a fun place for all ages! Â I came here on a weekday and it wasn't too packed.Even though the park opens at 10am, we were able to walk inside at 9:30am! Â It was nice to take pictures before it got too crowded. Â However, at around 10am, all of us had to wait for the National Anthem to play before we can walk further, since it was blocked off with a rope. Â There were a lot of anxious people waiting for the song, since it didn't play on time. Â Some of us even sang the song ourselves hoping we can pass..lol. Â We had to wait till 10:15am to hear the National Anthem. Â Once the rope was taken away, I saw a lot of people running to certain parts of the Seaworld.I love how there are a lot of shows throughout the day, so everyone should plan accordingly to catch most of them. Â I was able to see the following shows, but we only had about 10 to 15 minutes to get to the next show.1. Dog show - This was a really cute animal show featuring dogs, cats, pig, and even kangaroos! Â I enjoyed this show. Â 2. Shamu show - It seems like everyone in the entire park comes to this show, and there was only 1 showtime. Â I'd recommend people to show up early to grab a seat and sit near the exit for a quick getaway. Â I found the show to be good and entertaining.3. Dolphin show - I liked watching the dolphins doing the tricks. Â I didn't understand why there was an acrobatic and diving portion, since it didn't fit with the dolphin show. Â I wanted to see more dolphins!4. Sealion show - Sea Lions are good comedians and this was a good show. Â I felt it was a bit too short though.Another favorite area was the Penguin Encounter. Â There were at least 300 penguins for everyone to see. Â I love there were penguins standing outside in the sun, and I was about 5 feet from them!Overall, I'd definitely come back to SeaWorld."
1263,6/27/2016,4,"I went on the day of Shamu's celebration so the park was open late. I spent the whole day here and had a blast, though the prices were super expensive! (2 1 oz bags of chips=$7) The shows were the highlight of the park. Definitely watch 'Pet's Rule' and if you come on the right day, the best show of them all... 'Sea Lion's Tonite'! Â All in all, a joyful day"
1264,10/28/2016,5,"Are you ""nut jobs"" serious about the poor condition of the beautiful fish!? I visit Sea World every month as I live around the corner. I've been there 40+ times and I have never been disappointed. These fish are in great shape. All the workers there are very happy and informative. It's always fun and the kids are all having a blast. I'm glad we saved the whales from the Japanese fishers and when I grew up they were called 'killer whales'. No one even cared if they were slaughtered so Sea World opens up and have brought these beautiful creatures into our lives. Now, we love them. Sea World has saved 1000's of these creatures that are hurt. Hope they are never closed down. Many will never be saved.The world isn't perfect but at SEA WORLD it's pretty darn close!"
1265,9/24/2016,5,"Lots of fun luv shamu the rides are kid friendly , so many opportunities to be hands on with sea life ..."
1266,8/17/2012,4,"What's not to like? We interacted with dolphins, a true highlight of the day. We watched a polar bear, up close, wrestle with a bucket. A group of beluga whales frolicked freely. It is a very enjoyable way to spend a day.Make sure you go online and find admission coupons if you care about saving money, there are lots including AAA and fast food discounts. You can also bring in drinks and food if you're so inclined."
1267,11/10/2016,4,"We had such a blast! My family loved Sea World! The restaurant was great, animals even better. I would say that parking wasn't as cordinated as I was expecting g. I would recommend to not go on a weekend"
1268,8/20/2014,5,"What an awesome time! Sea world is a great amusement park to spend the day with family and friends. So much to do in this packed park. Def check out the sharks, polar bears and dolphins. The manta ray roller coaster was a lot faster than it looks and the Atlantis flume ride is definitely something you need to do at the end of the day because you will get drenched - guaranteed. Food selection was good and like all parks way over priced. But still the food was good. The only problem we had was with the map! The map isn't park user friendly and the signs in the park don't really show you which direction anything really is. Seriously we found ourselves walking the wrong direction several times though out the day. Â A great theme park loaded with a good time for all."
1269,1/23/2012,4,"Sea World San Diego is a great spot to visit with friends! Â Whether you have a large group or small, there is something for everyone here!My favorite part of Sea World were the 'Ski Lift Buckets' that carry you over the ocean! Â It was very calm and relaxing, with a fantastic view! Â At sunset, this is THE ride to hit!My LEAST favorite part was the Shamu Show. Â Which was both surprising and disappointing, since that seems to be Sea World's claim to fame. Â They just didn't do much in the show, and the performers were cheesy to a whole new level.The other shows at Sea World, however, are very enjoyable. Â I would see them all. Â And, of course, give yourself time to look at the fun fish and other sea creatures in all of the aquariums and exhibits throughout the park!Lastly, for those worried about food -- DON'T be. Â There are plenty of delicious options here for your choosing! Â Enjoy your time at Sea World! Â You'll have a WHALE of a day!PS: For those debating ""Should I go to Sea World or the San Diego Zoo while I'm in San Diego for the day?"", I would pick Sea World. Â Hands down."
1270,11/3/2012,5,"Every summer we take the residence at my job on a road trip. This year we went to San Diego .Let me start off by saying SeaWorld is the bomb!! A one day pass I believe is around $70 bucks so imagine buying 22(that's how many of us went) tickets at regular price would've been around 1400 plus tax!!! Being that most of our residence have disabilities, they have us a GREAT deal! I commend them for being very understanding and reasonable!!! It was so cool to be walking to see the whales and see flamingoes walking right be side me. The first show we got see was people flying in the air and stuff . It was really cool . The best show by far was the whales. It was so cool to see them follow commands . They have other things than shows. They also have rides and exhibits.We really had fun and cant wait to go back soon ! Thank you SeaWorld!!"
1271,10/22/2007,4,"Some tidbits about this park:*No straws or lids*Pretzels only by Dolphin Experience and Hospitality Cafe.*A Pepsi park, meaning...only Aquafina and Pepsi products.*Plastic thorns on top of eating areas (by Hospitality Cafe) to keep birds away. (see picture)*Current samplings include:Landshark, Mojito (recommend), Michelob Ultra Lime Cactus, Spiced pumpkin ale. Been here a few times, nice place to take the family to. The shows are great, make sure you arrive 1/2 hour before to get good seats. Food here is healthier, better, and slightly more expensive than your burger and fries theme park food. Turkey Sandwich: $7.99, real carved turkey with potato saladClub Sandwich: $7.99, freshly premade (see picture)20 oz Aquafina: $2.59Large soda: $2.99You can bring in your own food, I actually saw these Asian folks eating what looks like pre-made bentos from Mitsuwa. Might save you a few dollars if you do so...but you sure will look fobbish if you decide to do so."
1272,8/26/2014,5,"I was hesitant to go because of the animal cruelty people say there is , but I decided to give it a try . Parking is 16 $ the shows were all really freaking awesome ! ! The main attractions of the park are the shows not the rides since there is only about 5 . Food is pretty pricey but the drinks are a good price when you purchase any souvenir bottles . Only downside bring sunscreen it is not as hot but your skin will get sunburned . Overall it was such a good experience and I would recommend my friends and family to go :) the trainers look like they actually do care about the animals !!"
1273,9/16/2015,1,"Really didn't live up to my expectations. The whale show was not interesting at all, it consisted entirely of the trainers subtly disputing everything about the Blackfish documentary. I only went because I got free tickets from work but I definitely would not pay to go again. The best part of the day was I paid only $5 to feed the sting rays which was pretty cool. I would recommend going in the morning when they first open because it gets pretty crowed in the afternoon"
1274,10/17/2012,4,"Well worth the the price of admission to enter the park as there are so many shows and marine life to see! It's not everyday you get to see a puffin, penguin, dolphin, killer whale, sea lion, beluga whale or flamingo all on the same day! My absolute favorites were the dolphins and of course the killer whales (aka shamu). The dolphins were just to die for as they seemed extremely friendly, well trained and interactive with people. The shamu show is definitely the highlight of the entire park, even though it's only about 20 minutes. They perform many of the tricks you would see on TV, from flips to splashing the first 15 rows of the stadium. Be prepared to spend a good half of a day here because there's enough activities to keep yourself and the family busy for hours!"
1275,6/14/2016,5,My family love here. We have been the Annual member for two years. I feel so peaceful when I stay with animals here. Kids have a lots of fun too.
1276,10/16/2017,2,"Went yesterday. I love Sea World but this visit was disappointing. I expected the spooktacular sea world to be ""decorated"" a lot better than it is. Nothing fantastic like it was before. Taking pictures in front of seasonal decorations is fun but good luck finding many. Which is half the point of going at this time...Even the shark exhibit was lacking decorations. The station's that pass out candy were not placed where the whole park has a station. Sort of lame. They were all bunched up. I could of done a better job. Then several areas blocked off or under construction. Â Don't walk toward the Atlantis and think there's an exit to another area. Â Blocked off !! No signs either. Saw the haunted show with seymore and Clyde. Probably the best attraction. Sea world you are starting to suck. Let's see if you know how to decorate this upcoming season."
1277,3/2/2014,5,"How does this place only have 3.5 stars? I'm assuming most people just don't like the prices!If you're a san diego native you can get discounts and pay and day to go all year which is one of the best deals. I love Sea World, no matter what time of year. I like going when it's colder out simply because it's less crowded and there's no lines!There's been days when I do 45 minutes waiting at Shipwreck Rapids and days when I don't even find myself in a line and they let us go around twice! If you buy the annual pass, parking is free. Otherwise it's 20/15 depending on how close you'd like to be.Wear clothes that you don't mind getting wet and shoes that will be comfortable once they're wet. Definitely bring some kind of plastic to cover phones and wallets. For as big of a park as it is, it's surprisingly clean! If you're going to buy a drink, get the souvenir cup the refills are very cheap. Journey to Atlantis is a short but very fun ride. You get pretty soaked on this one. Shipwreck rapids is my favorite! The Wild Arctic Ride is a simulator that puts you in a room that moves and shakes, surprisingly fun. Blue Horizons, the dolphin/bird show is fantastic. I love the Shark Encounter, it takes you on a moving floor through an enclosed room where the walls and roof is see through to see all the beautiful animals. Dolphin point is great but always crowded! The tide pools are really nice because there's sooo many different animals down there."
1278,1/14/2013,3,"It was my second time at Seaworld yesterday. I went with my cousin on one of those tour trips on a tour bus.We had three and a half hours of free time to ourselves so me and my cousin went and watched all of the shows. We watched Pet's Rule!, SeaLions Live, Blue Horizons, and One Ocean. My favorites were Blue Horizons and One Ocean.SeaWorld isn't the most fun or interesting place but it was still nice to go again after not going for a really long time."
1279,9/24/2016,4,This place is so perfect for the kids. My kids are having a ball running around doing there thing.
1280,8/15/2014,3,"We flew through Sea World in a record 2 1/2 hours. Our 15 yo niece was not that impressed. Â The rides were for younger children. Â The shows were at odd times & we only made it to the rescue pet show. We would have been upset about our experience had we paid regular ticket price. Â The weekday $50 dollar ticket is a great deal for what Sea World offers in entertainment. Â The $16 parking fee is ridiculous & the $21 upgrade for closer parking is disgusting. Â We were able to bring our food & water in to the park. Â Overall, we recommend skipping this San Diego attraction unless you have small children. Â The SD Zoo is a better attraction."
1281,2/20/2013,4,"We had a great time! Got soaked like 3 times. Â I loved the sealions, the sharks, the show was great and got us we the first time lol Â  There was no Shamu... Â =( Not fair... Damn Shamu!!! Did someone like free him or something?? lolthe Manta ride was fun...I wanted to go on it again.. but we ran out of time. Â It never got overly crowded even thought the day was gorgeous. So I guess that's a good thing.It was pretty expensive especially since they charge you 15$ for parking Â =( FYI when they say you will get soaked.. they mean it lol. Â We read it on the bleachers of the show... but thought oh... how wet can you get?... yeah.. we got TOTALLY wet! lol So girls... don't bother getting your hair done if you just wanna go have fun and get the full experience, which I recomend, cause it will be in vain.xoxo"
1282,8/6/2014,4,Cool place for kids to hang around.It took us about 20min to walk from the parking lot to the park. Order the parking ticket online to save $1!Came here in August so perfect weather to stay.The shows are fantastic. But it is pretty hot so a hat is required or sunburnt will be seen by midnight badly.We have two kids so only get to visit the Penguin exhibit and some turtle place. They got nice cool heaters inside so do suggest to go there between 1-3pm to avoid the sun.The fireworks at 8:45pm is a must. Just go to the Shamu show at 8pm and stay there until the end of the fireworks!
1283,11/14/2013,5,"5 stars because there wasn't a thing I could hate about this place. Upon entry, there is a big play area for kids. Let my daughter play there until the shamu show, which was excellent. We then cruised around, petting dolphins, starfish, and looking at of the animals. Highlight of our trip was the dolphin show. My daughter loved it! Â There's flipping, splashing, ""flying,"" and a PRINCESS!We missed the other shows, so I'm unable to comment about them. But do plan your day to see the shows. Anything in between let your kids pick and choose. Enjoy your trip."
1284,6/29/2016,5,Curious to why week day summer hours close so early this year. Man my husband used to love to go hang out walk around after work for our relaxation.
1285,9/21/2016,1,Went to both the orca & dolphin show in which both times the same little girl got chosen to interact in both shows!! You may have started treated the animals better but not the kids that all deserve an opportunity.
1286,6/8/2017,5,The rides are so fun. Â The shows are excellent! Â Family friendly. Â Beautiful environment. Â Love the Pet Show the best!
1287,10/10/2016,3,"Totally not what I was expecting. I have been to sea world before in Texas like 20+ years ago. I remember the trainers before got in the water and got pushed around the pool and even got pushed up out of the water when the orcas breached. This time was nothing like that it was 30 minutes of waiting after you get into the arena for the show to start then a 15 minute show (10 of which the trainers were just talking) where the orcas just swam around the sides splashing people. Â The dolphin show was about the same except the trainers did get in the water there, if only for a minute. Show was still only 15 minutes."
1288,9/30/2011,4,"i came for the fish...i stayed for the funnel cake!seriously wow, they kinda rock funnel cake here. i think the last time i got it, it was a street vendor selling plain ones with powdered sugar and bottles and strawberry and chocolate syrup. here, you get a mountain of creme, ice cream, plentiful and delicious sliced strawberries atop the heavenly fried batter for about $8. worth every penny!--my company holds a picnic day at seaworld every year. pay $17 for admission, parking, a $15 voucher for ANYTHING at the park, and cool landyard with a laminated map. best of all...the park closes at 6pm to the general public and we get to stay till midnight!! amazing that there was an hour wait for the sky tram during the day, and we walked right onto it and stayed for a 2nd round at about 10 pm. also walked right onto the rollercoaster and did that a few times :Pok bragging time over. but seriously, ive been so spoiled the last few years this is the only way ill do seaworld.there is, of course, the moral dilemma of encouraging an ""animals performing for our enjoyment"" situation. trust me...im observant to it, as well as the protesters who were outside the park. but this place doesnt make me feel sick like ringling bros circus did. the marine life that are part of the shows were born at seaworld. the rescued animals are brought back to their natural habitat when ready. they eat pounds of fish a day, have a clean, comfy and safe life. it was truly amazing to see how intellegent they are. esp the dolphins and sea lions. missed 1/2 of shamu (lost track of time gording on funnel cake!) but obviously the show is different now without trainers in with them.food: if you are going to be eating a meal at seaworld, do the BBQ. forget hotdogs, fake italian, etc...the BBQ is damn good here. and my suggestion is to go with the brisket. the trio plate is enticing but you can have chicky anytime and the ribs are just eh. the brisket is delicious and the portion is huge! the corn is also heavenly. and really its a decent price for an amusement park. about $11 for that plate.we already established you should get the funnel cake for dessert.rides: the rapids are fun but every single person will get soaked on it. no chance...you will. we actually went home to change bc there was no way wed dry. def reserved for summer heat. the roller coaster was amazingly fun!! i loved. the sky tram is delightful at night but not worth an hour+ wait. the center sky thing is classic and fun, but only worth it if no line (last time we did of evening).the park is on the small side, it gets crowded, and normal admission is pretty pricy. if i didnt get the awesome company deal id Â prob be less enthused. but everyone should come here at least once.OH and new awesome roller coaster slated for summer 2012!!also, did you know the military families are absolutely free here? any busch garden establishment. pretty awesome; we met several during our visit."
1289,2/4/2016,1,Re: Response from Business Customer Service You have completely missed my point. I should have been notified that exhibits were closed due to renovations and that it was an educational day for kids at Whale tank.As a senior citizen paying $89 is just a rip off!
1290,9/17/2014,4,I havent been to seaworld since the new renovations in 2014 spring but im sure its not that different. The shows are awsome the food is fair but prices are high. Many shops and differences. Things are a bit if a distance from each other so hats and sunscreen will save you even if its a cloudy day. The play area is nice and its awsome that they have employees through the are to help the kids because it is quite large and can make a parent nervous about loosing the kid. Nice crawling area for toddlers and great location when you have older kids that wanna play because they play above your head. the halloween is underwheliming and so is snow days.
1291,7/12/2014,3,It's been awhile since I been here like 10-11 yrs. I'll start with the shamu show it's only like 15-20 min now and the shows suck now they don't get in the water anymore probably cause shamu had enough and starting fighting back..before they would swim in there and educate you about the animal not anymore :(( it just seems like a awkward show now.. The dolphin show didn't help that one sucked too no talking no education just music and now a weird ass bird theme this show was better then shamu but not by much. People actually walked out.. Then we hit the sea otter show this show was funny and educational there was this intro guy named biff he was pretty funny we enjoyed it .. Biff alone outdid the shamu and dolphin ...then we did the circus/ jet ski water show it was funny and cool to see the rope dancers or whatever there called they were pretty bad ass ...all the shows are pretty short in length 15-20 and your done ..Ship wreck cafe was good the salmon is tasty. Restrooms were clean overall a fun time we got free tickets so I'll come back before they expire I got a year. ..
1292,9/16/2017,5,"What a great place to enjoy learning about sea life and watching the animals do amazing shows. San Diego is beautiful and your day at Sea World is never disappointing. Dinner with the Orcas (miss Dinner with Shamu), Dolphins, Sea Lions, Penguins, Whales, it all there for our enjoyment."
1293,5/14/2016,5,"The documentary Blackfish turned this lackluster theme park into one of the greatest theme park on Earth. Â Based on today's experience, the lines were short, the food was superb, the employees were extraordinary and best of all the weather was perfectly cloudy with no harmful rays beaming cancer on you. Â The major ride attractions were pretty much, ""walk up and ride"" for most of the day except between the hours of 1pm to 4pm. Â It was almost mind-boggling to me how it was ghost town from opening to the afternoon and it became crowded for a few hours and it got way less crowded as it got closer to 5-6 pm. Â The park is well kept and everything was in good working order. Â I spent the whole day there and 12 hours, 9 to 9, was plenty of time to enjoy everything. Â My only complaint is the lack of open air wifi since my Sprint network coverage was spotty. Â The touch exhibits at the entrance of the park was really enjoyable. Â The food is pricy, but high quality. Â There are water bottle filling fountains so you can bring a water bottle to the park and stay hydrated. Â My experience here 2 years ago was as boring as it could be... maybe it would have rated a 3 star, but now the roller coasters, short lines, friendliness of the staff, and animal engagements truly made this a wonderful experience."
1294,1/1/2016,3,Park seemed a little rundown compared to the one in San Antonio. It was super crowded and that was expected because of the time of year (Christmas break). The park just seemed crammed in most areas and hard to navigate. It made it hard to enjoy anything as we were trying to not lose a five year old in the crowd. All of the shows were full so we really didn't get the true experience of Sea World.
1295,11/20/2013,4,"Being a San Diego native you can't pass up the ""Buy One Day Get the Rest of the Year FREE!"" deal, especially if you have kids.I am a HUGE fan of turtles/tortoises and I am really glad they redid their exhibit near Shipwreck Rapids. I am also a fan of the polar bear exhibit and the shows. My daughter is a fan of the Bay of Play and of course any exhibit where you get to touch the animals i.e. the starfish and dolphins. I appreciate that they change up their shows often so those of us who visit a lot don't get bored, especially with the Otter and Sea Lion show. That one is always a lot of fun as is the pet show. I know Sea World gets a lot of flack from PETA for their animal captivity, but they tend to do a lot of goodwill in rescuing sick/stranded sea life in San Diego and they treat their animals kindly. It is a great place for kids and parents to visit these majestic creatures up close and at the same time learn about conservation.As for the one star not given, it is because their food is not very good and their prices are a bit on the high side for refreshments and souvenirs."
1296,8/19/2017,4,"We took my daughter here last week and she loved it. My partner and I enjoyed all the presentations. There was a lot to see and many shows with the animals too. We bought one all day meal plan for 36$ and shared the food throughout the day. You can get one meal every hour from several of the restaurants. They meals were enough for the both of us and we were full all day. The meals came with a main dish, a side or dessert, and a drink... Some of the restaurants are better than others and offer more choices, each menu is posted inside and lets you know your options! We used the drink to get milk for my daughter's bottle. That was nice because we didn't have to worry about bringing formula or our own milk (she's 14 mos)! Prior to entering the park we also bought a souvenir drink cup right before the entry line. It was only 5$ and comes with free refills all day. If you purchase the cup inside the park it's 13$! You will save a ton of money if you do those two things! The park looks well kept and the animals seemed well cared for. I feel kinda bad for the whales but they have made changes and are working towards a better future for them. They stopped their breeding program and will not have them any more in the future, after the ones they have age out! I think that's a good choice because it's too small for them. But they are really beautiful creatures and they were fun to watch! Overall we had a great day and will probably be back when our daughter wants to go again!"
1297,7/13/2013,1,"I love Seaworld and I've visited the one in Florida and thought it was amazing. I just recently visited the one in SanDiego and it was nothing I thought it would be. It cost $80 for a 1-day pass; I paid $50 for the San Diego Zoo and it was 100 times better than Seaworld.This place was so out-of-date, smelled weird, poor construction of buildings and just overall crappy.I would NOT suggest anyone to visit this Seaworld location. You are better off going to the San Diego Zoo."
1298,5/25/2016,5,"Costco has a annual pass for $99, this is cheaper then the $155 on Seaworlds site and includes FREE parking a $16 savings"
1299,3/5/2016,5,1at time here with my daughter and fiancÃ©. We arrived a bit late but 3hrs is more than neigh time to enjoy yourself. We'll be back soon
1300,12/5/2015,1,"Way too expensive, 16 dollars for parking and then 90 dollars to get inside. Very disappointing exhibits. Just way too much money for what it is."
1301,11/3/2012,3,"We did the whole park in a day, rushing from show to show across the park. Â Wouldn't have been possible to see everything had we had kids or old(er) people. Â I know these things are made for kids, but I feel like we had a much better day than all the parents there (or even the kids). Â I do admit that some of the animals are pretty depressing. The enclosures seem way too small, I'm no expert, but they didn't seem happy. Â Puts a damper on the day. Â Though other animals seemed perfectly content.My favorite show was either the seal/walrus show or We Love Animals. Â Both showed extensive training and what animals are capable of. Â I was so impressed with the layout and obedience. Â I wish I could get my cat and dog to be so well behaved!Bought the 3 for 1 at Costco (GREAT DEAL!) 7 days at Sea World, the Zoo and WIld Animal Park for less than the price of two parks.Back to my review, I come here about once every ten years and that seems to be just enough. Â Good to go if you're in the area, but don't pay the $70. Â It isn't worth it."
1302,6/16/2012,2,"Now i know why i got my sea world kyxy event tix for free. We were told the park was going to be closed off to adults for this event, but it was not. Many of the food venues were closed by 6pm, with the exception of the junk food. Exhibits were cool as always, want to try to Atlantis ride someday in the future. Overall though, was pretty boring.Am always underwhelmed by this place. Glad i didn't pay the full price of $73 or i would have been pissed."
1303,11/13/2012,3,"Don't get me wrong, Sea World is beautiful, cute, and somewhat fun, for the first 2 hours, but once you do it, you won't have to come back for another year or two. My boyfriend and I got season passes because it was cheaper than an ordinary ticket and visited the park 3 times, and that was two times too many. The last time we went was today and we stayed for a total of 2 hours. It would have been shorter but we saw one of their cheesy shows and got on their idea of a 'thrill' ride. Again, this is great the first time, and I'm sure if you have little ones, they'd love it. The shows are really cheesy, kinda lame, and you have to deal with bratty little kids kicking you in the back and screaming. Honestly, it's not worth the drive, the money, or the time. Just go to an aquarium that is closer, it'll basically be the same thing."
1304,5/15/2016,5,"I enjoyed the park with my family. Â Lots of fun things to see and do with little kids that you cannot get anywhere else. Â Get the $39.99 meal ticket it was a great deal I have never been so full at a park. Â We only got 2 for a family of 4 and it was enough. Â The shows were amazing it was eye opening to see these marine creatures up close and personal. Â Recently this place has gotten bad rep for their killer whale captivity from a documentary, but this movie failed to show all the good that the park does... It opens young kids to an amazing world of sea life that they can't just get anywhere else from an aquarium or a whale watching trip. Â If we didn't have Seaworld my kids would not have had chances to pet so many animals and love these sealife as they do now."
1305,5/14/2016,5,"Our family of four went to sea world, on my two year old class field trip each ticket was only six dollars there for Â we took advantage of the price and made it family day also came along was Â my husband and seven year old daughter.I use to work at sea world fifth teen years ago when I was in high school so I knew what to expect my husband Â On the other hand has never visited Â the park nor has he had the desire to after watching black fish. Our family day turned out Â to be a great day my husband had such a good time he said next month when he gets paid he would like to purchase annual passes.I'm glad to see sea world has made some changes from the last time I worked at Â the park fifth teen Â years ago. the few shows we did get to see ,the shows where more educational and the animals where doing far few tricks. The shows where toned down a lot compared to when I work there. Why more rides but everything else was pretty much the same. I feel at least sea world is trying to improve there reputation unfortunately for Â the company they will always and forever have a black mark on them after black fish."
1306,12/28/2013,3,"Military appreciation - get in free! Â Don't spend 84/70 dollars for yourself & dependents if you're active duty. Â Sea world is another park that I don't recognize AT. ALL. Â My how things change. Â Very pretty park. Â Again Â one of those places geared towards those that are younger and like to sit and watch shows. Â My son and I are more adventure seekers. Â Give us rides. Â MOAR RIDES. Â MOAR FAST RIDES. Â That said, Manta was a great ride. Â The wait was only 5 minutes considering the massive line to get tickets and get in. Â Overall, great park - but I'm glad I didn't have to pay 160ish dollars."
1307,10/11/2017,5,just love sea world it relaxes me and i get my 4 hr walk or more ...
1308,10/12/2015,5,"Seaworld is so much fun! Â Went today and there were no crowds! Â If you are Military you can go to Seaworld for free once a year. You get yourself plus three family members in for free. Also I would recommend getting the all day dining wrist band. It is so worth it. You pay $36 and you can eat all day at four different restaurants. They are awesome restaurants too. You get an entree, desert or side plus a drink. You can eat all day as much as you want. If you just want desert or just a drink you can get that too. A lot of the sea animals are up close and you can touch and feed them. The dolphins came right up to us. Also the pet rules show is so cute. That is one of our favorites and a must see."
1309,4/15/2014,4,"There was a comment saying that teachers go for free. Â Not in San Diego if you didn't register by April 30th. Â No teacher discount. Â Just a comment.As members our daughter just loves this place and especially the December snow. Â I'm not going to get political on the upside/downside of Seaworld in general, but living in SD, whenever you hear of some animal needing a beach rescue you see Seaworld staff involved. Â They are in the community. Â The employees are very helpful and if you watch the training you see the love they have for the animals time and time again. Â We prefer the bbq restaurant as it's quite good. Â If they didn't have orcas it wouldn't change the experience for us at all, we're still going."
1310,4/8/2016,1,"Long lines, broken down rides and non-existent action. Not sure if I'll do this park again with my family."
1311,7/13/2015,1,"Seaworld is just the worst. I took my girlfriend here recently because she thought it would be a good idea, but this place has become a shell of it's former self since I visited as a kid. For starters, it is quite apparent that the animals are mistreated. You can tell by the way the orcas and dolphins behave that they are immensely depressed, which is really confounding when you see all the happy children cheering on their torture. I also don't understand the name 'seaworld'. You know where the real seaworld is? It's called the ocean. I don't care how many times yelp takes down this review, I am going to use that joke every single time. Save your cash parents and naive boyfriends, try going the beach instead. Go whale-watching, kayaking, or just about anything else so as to stop giving this horrendous organization money."
1312,6/3/2013,1,"This place is a shitshow. First of all, the park is actually quite small, and unless you want to get on the mediocre rides, you'll be done with everything pretty quickly. The animals are housed in relatively small enclosures, making this place sadder than any amusement park in SoCal should be. Considering the price of admission, you would think that they could update the displays and clean up some of the exterior facades. But creature comforts for your animals and even your guests must go out the window in the face of parting with some of your profits (SeaWorld is owned by a multinational investment firm based in NYC and is NOT a publicly operated park). I didn't even bother with the food here, because I knew it would be ridiculous. In fact, I managed to make it in and out of the park without paying for anything but my ticket. That miracle has to rank up there with the likes of changing water into wine (which, if I could have done, I would have.... because being drunk would have made some of the SeaWorld experience a little more bearable).The show that the staff put on with the whale and other animals was cheesier than the entire state of Wisconsin. It was meant to be inspiring, I guess, but the heavy-handedness of it all almost made me upchuck my breakfast. I sat in the back corner with my friend, and we quietly snarked our way through the ordeal long enough to at least get the payoff of a few killer whale tricks.SCREAMING KIDS, SCREAMING KIDS, SCREAMING KIDS. If you aren't a fan, GTFO of this park... or don't go in the first place. In fact, I would just encourage you to scratch this place off of your to-do list and just opt for more time at the San Diego Zoo (which is a non-profit and does more to help environmental concerns than some NYC-based investment bankers)."
1313,8/30/2012,4,"If you like sea creatures, you have to go at least once. Â If you have younger children, you can spend two days here. Â I used my AAA discount to get $20 off admission plus a second visit free. Â (It doesn't have to be consecutive days.)There is an iphone app (probably one for android too). Â Get it before you go and schedule all the shows you want to see. Â It's very difficult to get to back to back shows and you probably want to arrive 10-15 minutes early anyway to get a good seat. Â I was able to see every show they offer and all of them are entertaining. Â There are splash zones for the sea lion, dolphin and shamu show. Â If you are near the front, especially in the summer, you will get soaked!!The adult rides are decent. Â Atlantis is different. Â It is a combination log ride and roller coaster. Â You may get a little wet on this one. Â Manta is fun. Â It is a legitimate roller coaster. Â You have to be 48"" to ride. Â Shipwreck rapids is similar to the rapid rides at Magic Mountain or California Adventure. Â You will probably get wet and you may get completely soaked.For the smaller kids, there is a Sesame Street area. Â There are several rides geared for little ones as well as a playground, splash pad and an area to meet some of the characters. Â If you have children under 8 or so, you can spend a lot of your day here.For an additional cost, you can take a ride up a large tower to get a panoramic view of the park. Â You can also grab a gondola and cruise over the bay. Â I would say that it's worth it once just for the experience.If you can afford it, the animal interactions are great. Â So far we've only done the dolphin interaction. Â It's relatively affordable at $60 per person. Â You get a short private time with a trainer and a dolphin where you can feed it and grab some great photos and video. Â I really want to try the dolphin interaction next. Â That one includes some water time in a wet suit with these animals. Â I also just found out that there is a dining with shamu option. Â $40 per person for a poolside table. Â For all of these, call way in advance because they sell out about a week prior. Â You can also feed the sea lions and bat rays for a nominal charge and no reservations."
1314,7/20/2015,1,"The shows in which sea lions, whales, dolphins featured were mesmerizing. I never thought humans have so much power that they can command these wild animals to behave the way they want. I was spell bound and watched these animals perform those difficult tasks in awe.But heart ached, I still cannot overcome this feeling of guilt, powerlessness by watching those whales limited to a small open container (pools) filled with dirty water. Those dolphins, about 10-15 of 'em cramped in that one pool which is probably smaller than the pool at JW Marriot.The animals were always hungry, they performed tasks only on the promise of 'food' in return. The whales, dolphins, sea lions are able to survive on their own if in the wild (sea/ocean) but unfortunately they are left to the mercy of some humans. SeaWorld folks argue that animals live longer in captivity, of course they do! If you put me in house arrest 24/7 but provide me medical help when needed, good food and occasional social chat, I will survive longer compared to if I am roaming free, I won't get hit by a truck or shot by a terrorist, that doesn't mean I should be in a 'house arrest'.I hope in future, this abuse of wild animals is prohibited. I encourage all of you to speak out and feel the emotion, pain of these beautiful water based animals.............."
1315,12/25/2015,1,"We came to Sea World on December 24, 2015. We bought 3 adult tickets at $69.00 apiece. It was not worth it! The scheduling of the shows overlapped each other so that if we saw the Pet Show, we couldn't see the Dolphin show, etc. Over HALF of the exhibitions were closed! such as the Shark tube!!! What a disappointment."
1316,6/29/2013,1,"Holy moly. What happened to this place? I went here as a kid. In June 2013 I returned with my own family (wife, 2 toddlers) as part of our vacation. It's like nothing changed. The facilities and entertainment appeared very dated. Yes, there are new rides and attractions, but for the price of admission I would go to other places (ie. LEGOLAND). Even during the shows performers made noticeable errors, but not for lack of trying.Someone told me this place was struggling financially since the departure of the Shamu. This would explain the lackluster-ness. On the positive side, the multi-level arctic section was a very fun experience for adults and kids. The helicopter ride was a waste of time, with dated video and a ride that made me want to throw up from motion sickness. Everyone in my group shuffled out in silence.Will this excite the youngest of youngsters? Yes. Was it horrible? It is if you compare it to other places. At the end of our visit (last, ever!), even though we got admission as part of the 3 for 1 pass deal, I still had that feeling of being ripped off. Unless there are major changes to this place (better quality of attractions and/or decreasing the admission costs), I will not be returning."
1317,5/29/2015,1,"Horrible place for animals and humans alike ... With its rundown looks and overpriced food/drinks save your money for Disneyland !!! Besides the fact that the animals held here are miserable and In poor health !!! Think twice before giving them your hard earned money, your conscience might thank you ......."
1318,8/30/2017,3,"On August 12, we spent the day at Seaworld San Diego. My kids had a great time and, of course, wanted souvenirs of their day at the park. Â We waited until the end of the day to buy them, because we didn't want to have to carry the stuff around. At the end of the night, we went into the Seaworld Store at the entrance to the park, and proceeded to get our souvenirs. Â I paid for them and the cashier put our purchases into the cute tote bag that I bought. Â Great. Â We got back to our hotel and while looking through the bag, we realized that one of the kid's souvenirs was missing. I called and left a message on the phone number on the receipt Sunday morning on our drive home. Â No call back. Â I made a second call on Monday, again leaving a message. Â Finally got a return call on Tuesday, August 15th. Â Tyana, the Assistant Supervisor, Mechandise Support, asked me to send her a photo of my receipt, so she could send me the missing item. Â She emailed me her information. I emailed her the photos with my address. It is now, August 25th and I have not heard anything more from Seaworld and I still don't have my item. Â I did send a second email on August 23 looking for a follow up. I guess good customer service is not to be expected, especially when they already have your money.***UPDATE***It took 2.5 weeks, but I received my missing souvenir this afternoon."
1319,2/20/2016,4,"Say what you want about the Orcas and show animals, but I was fortunate enough to get a backstage view of the treatment for local sick animals. Sea lions caught in nets or injured from boat propellers, dolphins and other animals beached on the shore. There are tanks in the back that the public doesn't get to see but make me proud to support them. That said, rides are better now than before. Manta is pretty sweet. It's no Disneyland in as far as theming and attention to detail but it's local and entertaining. The kids love it."
1320,4/18/2014,4,Well I think the prices of admission is ridiculous..... And you have to pay for parking- which is also ridiculous.Other than that.... The shows are great. The otter and sea lion show is hilarious. Loved it so much. They have a great play area for kids! The Sesame Street area. Lots to do and tons to eat.
1321,9/27/2015,1,Seaworld as a whole is an awesome wonderful place and I give it five whole stars but today the service we got on one of the rides there it's Zoe little teacup things. Â  There was a girl Nicole that worked there that could have absolutely cared less about her job she didn't look at the exit when I was flagging her down for our handicap pass and finally I just told my kids to go on the exit and get on one of the cars she didn't say anything about that either she just simply was miserable to be at work I felt really bad for her it was hot but everyone else in the whole entire park was pleasant except for Nicole hopefully she'll have a better day next time
1322,10/17/2015,4,"SeaWorld is a fun, if expensive, amusement park. The shows are pretty entertaining, even for adults. I appreciate the occasional free military admission, though I'd prefer a little less restriction on who I can bring as a guest, and maybe a more consistent line about when it's free to visit rather than running the same promotion every year and arbitrarily extending promotion times. Like any amusement park, food and drinks can be pretty expensive. Focus on the shows and bring a water bottle and sun screen."
1323,4/23/2014,5,"Overall, we had a great time at Sea World in San Diego!The lines were not as bad as I had anticipated and their attractions were all very interesting.The park is quite large so make sure you pick up one of their maps.Food is pretty expensive and tastes about average but that's to expect from these places.The main reason we visited Sea World was to participate in the Penguin Experience Tour and what a memorable experience it was!This special add-on to your Sea World visit is limited to only 12 people or so at a time and there is only one tour per day so make sure you book your spot quickly and in advance.I do like how they keep the groups small because it gives each person more time to spend with the penguin when you finally meet him!I've read somewhere that each person only gets to spend about 20 seconds with the penguin but it was actually a little over 2 minutes per person which was really great.Anybody who loves penguins will definitely leave happy because you do get to meet and closely interact with a real penguin!Our bird was surprisingly calm and seemed to enjoy the attention :)You can view our encounter here:youtu.be/dT9wb5mzbpc?hd=1But one word of advice: we learned their birds aren't ""potty trained"" in any way. Our bird ""relieved"" himself twice during our time with him and when he did he didn't just drop it but he actually shot it out strong! The second one almost hit me so when you do get to visit your penguin and you see him suddenly lift his tail please RUN FOR COVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1324,7/5/2013,2,"I admit, I've been to Seaworld SD and Seaworld orlando, against my better judgement. I'm not a fan of captive animals, in general.But I digress. This is not a political piece.I was brought to Seaworld SD about six years ago, when my boyfriend and I first started dating and it was amazing! I truly enjoyed myself. However, I went back about four months ago ... and I was so incredibly pissed. I don't know if I have matured THAT much in six years or if SeaWorld has become more a children's playground, but either way, screaming children knocking on the windows of all the marine animals made me more than a little upset. I was sorely tempted to start knocking on the windows of the food places while they were all eating lunch, just so they could see how it feels. Has no one seen Free Willy? Orcas don't like that ish.Besides the annoying children, the shows are considerably less dramatic and a lot less funny, the prices are a bit higher, and parking sucked. At least put a few trees all up in there so my car isn't a billion degrees when I get inside!Overall, worth it once, not worth it a second time."
1325,7/25/2015,5,I have been to SeaWorld two different times and would love to go many more times its just expensive especially for a big family like I have. I really enjoyed the dolphin show That was my favorite part. The kids spot was super cool and my sons were so excited to meet Elmo!! I will be back again one day SeaWorld lol
1326,9/30/2017,4,"I have been going to seaworld since i was small,now i have two kids and i took them they were impressed,its just the shows are short only 15 minutes ,i think it should be a bit longer,and also the hours its until 5 pm on weekdays it should be a little longer.but overall its a goid place.i would reccomend for you guys to at least go see it once"
1327,7/10/2016,4,"SeaWorld was both what I expected as well as not what I expected all at the same time.First off, we splurged and bought the up close parking for a whopping $4.00 more dollars lol and it was totally worth it. We parked about 30 feet from the front entrance. The kids really liked the area where you can reach in and touch the sea life. They got to touch some sharks and horseshoe crabs and stingrays. They even have a tank full of little cleaner fish that will eat away the dead skin from your hands and feet. After that, it was on to the shows! First we saw the Orca show but things have changed greatly since I visited last. Of course, I haven't been to SeaWorld in 28 years and that was in Orlando but I remember the animals doing more tricks and the handlers being able to swim with the whales and interact with them more. Â I guess when the whales start to kill the handlers, they have to change up the rules.The show was still entertaining and informative. We sat in the top of the soak zone and did get a little wet but not like the folks down in front. They are not kidding when they say that you will get wet. I think wet is an understatement for some of the people we saw. More like drenched.Next we saw the Dolphin show and that was more the way that I remember it from years ago. Very entertaining as well. Then we saw the sea lion and otter show. This was the best show of the day! First of all, when you are waiting for the seats to fill up and the show to begin, there is a performer dressed like a janitor named Biff. He walks around with a rag and pretends to be cleaning things up. He interacts with the kids and acts silly and then he finds a case full of DVD's. He decides to put them into the player and then mimics the dances from the movies that he plays. He even changes outfits and uses props too. It was great entertainment and the guy was really talented.After these, we went for a bite to eat. We decided on the Shipwreck Reef Cafe because of the menu but when we got there, it was not what we had expected. You enter what appears to be a nice restaurant and then find yourself in a cafeteria line picking up a tray and making your way down the line. You get to choose from a pile of pre-cooked meats and desserts that have been sitting out for hours. Then you take your tray to a cashier and pay astronomical prices for mediocre food and then you go get your utensils and condiments etc...After all of this, good luck trying to find a place to sit. To say the least, lunch was not our favorite part of the day. After lunch, we visited the kid's play area where the Sesame street characters come out to play and we did some souvenir shopping before my wife and daughter went to ride the roller coaster and the rest of us checked out Shamu underwater.It was a fun filled day but we didn't do everything that there was to do there. Gives us a reason to go back again.One thing that really bothered me while we were on our visit was that I constantly felt as if they were trying to reach into my pockets and take every last penny that I had. I do appreciate the work that they do to rescue sea life, rehabilitate it and then release it back into the wild but if they are relying solely on the profits that they earn inside of their parks then they are doing something wrong. They bring darn near the entire gift shop to every show and walk down the isles peddling it. I felt like every item was being crammed in my face and of course, the kids wanted one of everything they saw. They have collector cups that are refillable but watch out where you buy them. In the shows, the prices are $19.99 but in some of the kiosks and shops, they are a few dollars cheaper. Then you can refill them all day for $0.99 each refill. We didn't do the all day dining deal but it's worth looking into if you plan on being there all day. I'm sure that SeaWorld has something for everyone and you'll have a great time.Thanks for reading."
1328,12/5/2016,1,"They treat the animals like garbage. Very sad, my daughter cried after noticing the bent fins on the killer whales. Won't return"
1329,10/14/2011,5,"What can I say? Â I love this place. Â While there was a visit in my distant childhood memory, colored by a vague remembrance of Shamu, this visit was a visit of adulthood, as I spent a day with my youngest sister and part of it in the company of dolphins.Yes, that's right, I did the Dolphin Experience. Â Weighing in at $195, separate from the $60+ you will pay for park admission, it's not for the faint of wallet, but I promise you that it is an experience that you will keep with you forever.I was absolutely blown away as an adult...I can't imagine what (and you have to be 10 years old, kids!) this would have done to me as a child. Â Dolphins are every bit as smart, friendly, and breathtaking up close and personal as you imagined them to be. Â These gentle creatures responded to spoken and whistled commands with obedience *and* panache. Â They were showing off but they weren't arrogant about it. Â You'll get to feed, pet, train, and give commands to your dolphins (and hug and kiss it too, if you'd like). Â The entire experience is extensively photographed, and these excellent photos are (of course) available for purchase. Â I suppose this is the part where I explain that I'm okay with some animals being in captivity for two reasons: Sea World uses a lot of funds to help rescue and conserve. Â The good of the many borne by the sacrifices of a few. Â Secondly, I saw over and over the pure wonder and joy of young children as they had a chance to meet, interact, feed, and see these amazing creatures - be they the otters or killer whales, or the penguins and sea lions, sharks, and turtles. Â You can't put a price on the love and respect for nature and conservation that a visit to Sea World must necessarily imbue on a young mind.Add a delicious variety of foods - ranging from pizza and pasta to bbq and sandwiches - all around the park, along with the right balance of infotainment that marries learning to great exhibits and tactile interactions, and you've got Sea World. Â Make time to go. Â Your children will thank you for it, even if they can't truly articulate the impact at that time."
1330,6/10/2018,4,"It is clear that Sea World puts all of the attention to what's inside the gates, as it was all wonderful. Â  That said, the parking is a complete disaster. Â  When you arrive, there is a parking ""menu."" Â  General ($20), Close ($30), or VIP ($40). Â  As I often do with choices such as this, I paid a little extra for the middle option. Â $30 got us a spot really really close to the park entrance. Â We were thrilled with the choice....until we went to leave the park. Â  We stayed until the park closed at 7:00 pm and it took 45 minutes just to get out of the parking spot itself. Â An hour and a half later, we reached the parking lot exit! Â The experience ruined the excitement of the day (at least for the parents). Â Sea World REALLY needs to figure it out. Â  Pay attendants to manage the fact that everyone leaves the park at the same time, much like a sporting even or concert. Â  It was the Wild West out there with no effort from Sea World to manage the chaos. Â  Very disappointing!!! Â  Â Pay for general parking and park close to the exit!!!"
1331,8/30/2015,1,"Not a happy place. The employees are not enthusiastic, the tanks are far too small for the animals, and the rides are underwhelming. Would never want to go back."
1332,11/8/2015,5,Steve-O doesn't know what he's talking about! Sea World is Great!
1333,4/24/2017,5,"Animal education and conservation at it's best! I brought my 85 year old mom for her birthday. She had the BEST time! I don't know how anyone can go there and not get a better respect for our environment, those beautiful creatures and the world we share. Every time I go I get a renewed energy to be a better environmentalist. Thank you SeaWorld, keep doing what you do!!!"
1334,7/22/2014,4,"Went on monday and wednesday but geez. Â So many people Â and they scan ur index finger print with ur ticket. Guess security issue. Anywhere u go too many people. If u want drink get the souvenir cup right from the start ($10) but then u will get refills for $1. Food are Super expensive and the service is way to slow so bring ur food if possible. Â I had two 2year old boys and they loved orca , sea lion and dolphin show. Â Stroller is the must if u are bringing a kid who is not into walking. I didnt bring it on monday so it was horrible for my son but for my nephew, he was ok. Â On wed I brought it and it was nice. He was sleeping in the stroller and i could take it into penguin and wild arctic. Otter place with quiz board on how many hair does otter have was broken. Up at the view place with listening to dolphin sound does not work. Really?? Please fix it. Â For lunch i Had hot dog for 8 dollar with chip but no drink. Â Got separate Smoothie but whats up with no lid?? Â Bound to fall down. Â On next day got hawaiian grilled sandwich with spam. Â Not so good and the kid menu is horrible like 4 tiny fried shrimp with more fries. Â Really?? Again bring some decent food inside. Â Kids love shows no doubt but have to go there when its less crowded. Â And for orca show if u want to get soaked sit i front. U will see more. U need to be there really fast. 10-15 min early wont cut it. Â If u r not sure still sit at like 5th row then u can get out to the front with ur kid to get soaked but orca tale splash. Saw orca show twice and it was nice. Â Dolphin show has so much to see but gotta decide which one u want to see since it would be hard to be at soak zone for both show. Â Penguin and arctic wild are great and at the pole to pole shop, we got to see a real warm weather penguin. Â The penguin actually checked out my sons swim pants. The cleaner fish, sharks are very nice to touch. Â Sesame street rides and small parks for all the fun things for kids are good place for parents to chill out"
1335,6/23/2016,3,"The Shamu show has definitely changed since I last visited. For good reason of course, but I do feel it has lost it's charm. Â The Shipwreck ride was fun and the Le Mer show was very entertaining."
1336,7/30/2014,5,"I love to go theme park, sea world is one of my favorites. Went there last week forgot to bring hat, got sun burn. You have to watch all the shows, it is so amazing! My top 1 is the dolphin show, it is so cute!! I recorded a lot of videos haha. The pet show is cool, if you like dog and cat you need to see this. I was impressed they can train cat and pig and duck. I had a lot of fun there. Buy parking online can save $1. Haha"
1337,9/11/2011,4,"My favorite things about Sea World:-Feeding the seals and sea lions! Â If you think about it, it is pretty ridiculous to pay $6 dollars to feed someone else's animals, but it was really fun that I just had to do it twice. Â You get a tiny tray of fish and the minute you walk up to the feeding area, the seals start barking like maniacs. Â Since there is a giant tank full of them, they all compete for your attention in order to be fed. Â Some even did tricks such as wave their little fins, and others clapped to get your attention. Â But, beware of the birds, they will try to attack you for your fish, as well. Â Totally worth the money for the experience. Â -The penguin exhibit. Â Penguins were super cute and actually active, unlike the polar bears. Â Least favorite parts of Sea World:-The shows! Â They were super tacky and cheesy. Â Maybe, if you were under the age of 12, you would be entertained and amused. Â But, I was deathly bored. Â The ""Shamu Rocks"" show did not rock, but the stadium is a perfect area to watch the fireworks show. Â The only show that was slightly decent was the night time sea lions show, but in order to enjoy that, you have to watch all of the other shows to get the parodies. Â -$14 dollars for parking!Tips: Â -If you are going to go on the water rides, definitely bring an extra pair of clothes or get a rain poncho because you will get soaked!-If you are going all day, definitely do the ""all-you-can-eat pass"" because even though the food sucks, it ends up being a decent deal.-Get the roasted corn! Â They have butter, mayo, garlic salt, cayenne pepper, etc as toppings. Â Super good!"
1338,7/4/2017,1,VERY Disappointing- total confusion and dis organized - from the get go - just pulling in to park - and I believe because SeaWorld is greedy - different pricing levels for parking - is what moves line like a snail to get it in -we general parked and it was perfect less than 5 min walk - don't waste your $. Then we move on to all day dining - again all about the $$ for Seaworld - all lines participating restaurants have about 1-2 cashiers and no employee but out to offer how it works - all menus are confusing and all lines you probably wait 45 to an hour to eat - so you will NOT be eating every hour - due to lack or service - bad deal ! Smokehouse best food - Shipwreck - fast moving (best service ) okay food . Pete's okay food - great pineapple floats that you pay for ! Mama Stella's horrible food and service - your school lunch was better back in the day! Manta ride great - employees ride ! Atlantis - great ride too ! Orca show/ sea lion show boring ! The Cirque show is amazing ! My experience was that they wasn't extra money for anything you do in order to make it less stressful ! Download app like it says all around park but forgets to also note you'll pay for any quick que or reserved seating . I'm an Native OC girl been a long time since I was at Seaworld - and just went on July 3rd 2017 and won't be back ! Another piece of advice double check show times and Park hours those are wrong too !! Good luck Seaworld
1339,11/1/2013,3,"Was excited to visit Seaworld after not being here for 15+ years! So I didn't remember seaworld at all or what it offered.I was disappointed :x Normal one day tickets cost $79. We had triple A so it's $72. Which I think is way too overpriced for a, well to be honest a sort of run down amusement park. Most of their rides look pretty old, like from the 80s' maybe. Which is fine, but the whole atmosphere is not as welcoming as other amusment partks, it's just a tad depressing in my opinion. Weird halloween music was playing when I went in Oct, which is fine but note the WEIRD. Also they don't really have staff walking around where you can ask about directions, it's hard to find staff that isn't working with animals or working at the food places.The shows are good I admit and that's the only redeeming part of seaworld left I think. And they really do seem like they care about the animals and want to urge the public about conservation efforts. So maybe that's where the money is going rather than renoovating the park, which is noble of course. But if the park is so drab to visit.. there won't be too many visitors anymore. When I went, the lines weren't too long as least and there weren't many international visitors. Without the visitors and the revenue I feel like it'll be hard to carry on what is really important here.lol just my two cents on that :) The shows with the animals, dolphins, shamus are really amazing though!!"
1340,4/5/2016,2,"I'm a San Diego native and spent allot of time at Sea World. I will no longer visit as they have gone from Marine conservation & education to a theme park with roller coasters. I understand that its hard to make a profit being a place of education--so you bring in rides to get the people to show up. But that should not be done at the cost of the exhibits and animals. Its Sad, I don't see Sea World lasting very long."
1341,9/11/2016,4,"SeaWorld is a great place to bring kids and family. I think being in a larger group is more fun, but I've come here a couple times with just my daughter and myself. I have been coming to SeaWorld ever since I could remember, but it has definitely changed a lot and is much more interactive and conscious about the environment for marine animals.For the family, there are a few rides that both adults and children can enjoy and there are also lots of informative and interesting exhibits where people can learn facts about the specific types of marine animals they have there that SeaWorld. Not to forget to mention the shows. The shows are a lot different from when I was a child, but they still are fun to watch.Since I have a daughter and almost every time we end up going to the Sesame Street Bay of Play at one point or another, I'd like to say that they have upgraded it quite a bit. They still kept some of the older ideas (or equipment in other words) that they had back when I was a kid, but there is a lot more staff watching all areas and making sure kids are safe on all of the equipment. The three rides they have are absolutely adorable and great for young children, however, lines for the rides can be very long and you'll find yourself waiting up to almost an hour depending on how long the lines are and how many people groups are ahead of you. Overall, they have had many additions which I think are great, however the arcade is a little bit on the sad side because the arcade is not quite lively and I find that it is dark and not very appealing to the kids compared to all of the other colorful and more active areas.Our experiences overall are pretty great at SeaWorld and I can't forget to mention that the food is amazing. Overpriced, but the food is pretty good. Just know you might dish more than you'd like to hope for a meal and even a snack."
1342,4/16/2016,5,Amazing experience . 5 star! I am usually not to love shows but they have an Exceptional Â one called pets rule. It's all rescued animals. They perform amazing feats like a cat that climbs a tower and jumps in its trainers arms. A dog that hurls itself over its trainers head. The most wonderful part of the show they saved these animals lives and brought happiness and joy to me and my son. Thank you Sea World!
1343,5/27/2013,1,"Went to sea world on a Saturday. Parked my SUV and locked it. Came back and my SUV got broken into. Â  These were very professional group of thieves. Broke into my car with no damage and took ipad, purses and items that were not replaceable. Yes we shouldn't have left them in there but still. They have watch towers in the parking lot but no one was in there. What is the fuckin point of having them if you don't staff them. Besides the theft, the park is so old and outdated. Rides were lame and it feels like it never changed since the 90s. Watched shamu and even the trainers now won't go I to the water with the whale since thy incident involving the trainers death. What a waste of a good Saturday. I rather go and watch the padres play. Plus $15 for parking is retarded. Only thing good is that I didn't pay for these tickets."
1344,5/26/2014,4,"I just visited SeaWorld this weekend for the first time since I was a young girl. I thoroughly enjoyed myself even as an adult! The shows were fun and informative. We downloaded the app and found all the badges throughout the park to score free bubbles and ice cream. The food places were better than any amusement park I've been to. Of course everything costs money, but every penny we spent contributed to a wonderful experience. Ironically, we watched Blackfish the same night when we returned home from the park. But the SeaWorld organization has helped to breed endangered species and are on call to rescue stranded and injured marine life. I will return to SeaWorld to take my daughter when she is old enough to remember."
1345,7/28/2015,5,Most of you already know what to expect from a place like SeaWorld so I am not going to bore you with the details of my step by step experience. Personally I am just going to say I was pleasantly surprised by how GREAT! their customer service was throughout the entire park. We were there on a group trip with my Mothers work so we not only experienced the park but also the private catering area with food and some entertainment. It was the type of food you'd expect from a catered theme park event Hamburgers and sides however the cookies were Â amazing. The biggest take away I got from the park was the Â POSITIVE ENERGY of the staff. From the food service workers to the trainers everyone seemed to be happy to be there and enjoying their jobs. Not to mention when my son got lost briefly they were very helpful! That documentary Â hurting their PR could be the cause for the culture change but it could also just be because the place is run by the right people . Â  Just know that they offer fast pass options that can help with long lines. I recommend checking out as many shows as possible. We were there for the 50th anniversary so we got to see awesome fireworks.My favorite Â was the Sea lion / Otter show. We also really loved the Artic experience. If you are into animals and enjoy getting hands on experiences this place is worth a trip especially since they have amazing customer service and reasonable prices for what you are getting. BRING PONCHOS for any of the water experiences!!!! I wish we had.. We were soaked and it was quite unpleasant.
1346,10/10/2015,5,"We love this place. My kids learn a lot and have developed a keen sensibility to protecting the environment and species. The grounds are immaculate and the staff friendly. Love the new entrance! Also so glad that Seaworld remembers the military and our freedoms as,Americans. All the haters we see protesting out on the street - get a life. The people working at Seaworld care for the animals and love the planet just as much as you do."
1347,2/28/2012,5,"Valentine's Dinner with ShamuWow, Wow, Wow,..... 1st Class all the way. My husband took me to Sea World for Valentine's Dinner with Shamu. We assumed that the ""private"" show, after hours, would be great, and we were not disappointed, and that the food would be mediocre because it would be a fixed menu for a fixed number of people. We were so surprised. The food was GREAT, and the service was FANTASTIC. From Mele, the hostess, to Miguel, our waiter, and Mark, another waiter, we could not asked for better service. This was an all inclusive meal, including beer, wine, and champagne. Nothing was skimped on and they weren't selfish with keeping our glasses full.We started with Champagne & Caviar Toast. I had never had Caviar. It was really quite tastey, not fishy ""at all"". Â Their Caviar gave me a whole new perspective on Caviar. Yum-Yum.Then came the Heirloom tomato salad, winter greens, Humboldt Fog cheese,cold pressed olive oil and coffee vinaigrette. The tomatoes were perfectly ripened, sweet and tasty, and the greens were absolutely fresh. I could have eaten the salad for a whole meal. It was so good.Our next surprise was Baked Mushroom ""Soup en Croute"" and chive spear. I'm not one to like mushrooms, but this soup was so sweet and creamy. I ate ""all"" of that too. Needless to say, I was already getting full. Then, along came another course, Diver Scallops, Wild Rice Martini, and Coconut Curry Beurre Blanc. These scallops were so delicious... totally ""fresh"". Again, no fishy smell and not at all rubbery, as often I have found Scallops to be. Just a note, aside... this evening would not have been appropriate for children. Sea World does have plenty of other lunch and dinner opportunities that are more appropriate for children. This was a romantic evening for you and your honey.Finally, our main course came, Surf and Turf, angus beef mignon, sustainable salmon medallion, Suzie's farm winter vegetables, and roasted creamer potatoes. I had filled up so much on the preceding courses, I could not eat all my dinner. Plus, I had to leave room for dessert. My husband really enjoyed his extra portions. The steak was wonderful and the salmon fresh and perfectly cooked. To top it all off, dessert followed with triple chocolate valentines, warm chocolate lava cake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate ice cream. If your a chocoholic like I am, you would have died for this dessert.... OMG ... so yummy!The show was awesome. We got lots of ""up close"" time with the whales and plenty of picture opportunities. Just remember to charge your camera batteries... LOLSo, all in all, Valentine's dinner was a ""1st. Class Act"" and we plan to go next year as well. .... most fun Valentine's dinner I can ""ever"" remember."
1348,5/20/2015,1,"Permanently disabled people with companions are no longer welcome at Sea World. As a businessman, I would want to get as many members to join as possible.  Â  Â I have a daughter that lives in a group home that is escorted around town by various ""companions"" that work at the government run group home. There is no telling who the companion might be that day. There is now no way that my daughter can buy an annual pass and be allowed to bring an escort to take her around the park. I called all morning long for over 2 hours to all the different departments at Sea World San Diego to help me out and to assist my daughter. All I got was that each companion that escorts her would need to buy a single day pass, even though my daughter can only stay for a few hours at a time. With memberships droppingandBad pressand the park loosing lots of money,you would THINK, that they would be more open to helping put the disabled community.it is not so here.PLUS, They refused three times to even allow me to speak to a supervisor.Its very sad.I have been going to Sea World of San Diego for close to 40 years....I am very saddened to hear this...."
1349,9/9/2013,5,"I've been coming to San Diego Sea world since I was a little girl, now I take my little girl here. Its closer to home, cheaper than Disneyland and still fun!I hold a Silver pass which is great, it allows me to have free parking and access into the park as many times and I want. So, I come here pretty often. I really like the Madagascar live show that Sea world has - my daughter gets real excited about it.The kids areas is really friendly and colorful- and we especially enjoy the pet show."
1350,9/21/2013,3,"It's been about 12+ years since I was last at Sea World. Â We went recently to take my son for the first time. Â I don't know what it is but I remember Sea World being much better. Â We watched the dolphin show and the shamu show. Â I think the dolphin show is much better than the shamu show. Â As far as rides, my 2 year old was pretty much limited to rides in the Sesame Street bay of play. Â Definitely a fun place for the little ones. They have a play area specifically for toddlers 39 inches and under. Â They have a little climbing course with nets and bridges, which my son enjoyed. Â  Â For the price of Sea World I guess I was expecting something much better."
1351,1/10/2012,4,"One of my favorite parks ever! The Shamu show is the iconic performance that many of you think of when you picture Sea World. They have a set number of ""tricks"" and though they change their show throughout the year, they do pretty much the same thing. What I like to go for is their aquariums. They display many of their fish and animals very neatly. I just hate the thousands of people who are there beating on the glass. Reminds me of Finding Nemo.They have a great turtle exhibit which is one of my favorites. But their jellyfish is lacking. Still Monterey Bay Aquarium wins out on that one. I remember the first time I went when they had a baby Gray Whale they rescued from the coast. Can't remember its name...."
1352,9/17/2015,5,We spent the whole day here and it was terrific. Lots of people but enough room to navigate. We got the all day dining pass which was a great deal. Bought the bottomless soft drink cup that was also a great deal. The shows and exhibits were fun and entertaining. I would definitely come back here.
1353,9/5/2013,4,"Loved Seaworld! Haven't been here since I was in High School so it's been a while lol. Was excited to see all the changes, new shows and attractions they have now! We went on a family outing (actually I tagged along on my friend's family adventure but that is besides the point lol) and we had a blast.The kids (ranging from 4 - 16) all loved it. Everybody was entertained by either the fun Shamu / Dolphin shows, live animals & sharks or loved the rides. We even let the kids run free in the Sesame Street area for a bit, as they got wet, climbed and ran like little mice in the mazes in the sky and watched Bert & Ernie and friends sign autographs. We were surprised how it was wasn't crowded on a Saturday on Labor Day weekend! Journey to Atlantis ride only had a 15 minute wait! Amazing! We were able to breeze through the day without any issues and had so much fun. Can't wait to do it again some day :) FYI, we did get soaked watching the Shamu show and wet in the Dolphin show. We were in the right side around the 5th - 8th row! But it was so hot outside we dried off pretty quickly."
1354,4/30/2016,5,"Great balance of rides and shows, amazing. If you can ignore negative stories and you're not a true animal conservationist/rights, the theme park it is very entertaining. The park gives you very close up experience with the Marine animals whilst having extremely fun rides.The sea lion show was very entertaining with Biff stealing the show with great comedy."
1355,10/19/2011,3,"After not visiting the place for oh, almost ten years... I could definitely go another ten before I go again. Â Tickets are the same price as Disneyland, although they have about forty less rides and far less ambiance to be impressed by. Â The animal exhibits are cool yet a bit antiquated. Â The Shamu show was the coolest part about the park - everything else screams, ""Revamp me!""If you're looking to be in awe of the wonders our natural world creates, visit the local zoo. Â It's cheaper and more stimulating."
1356,8/23/2015,5,"My son and I went to SeaWorld last week. We LOVED IT! I also visited a few years ago. I love the changes that were made in the Shamu Show! It was AMAZING! I wont even call it a show, it was a learning opportunity to learn about the environment and how SeaWorld really supports our coast by taking in sick and wounded sealife addition to caring for them. You also get to see the PASSION in the trainers! All the employees seem very happy, the park was clean and the animals are happy! GREAT JOB SeaWorld for stepping up your game. I plan to come back very soon and purchasing passes. As far as the documentary (I wont say) I'm a believer in change and you've done that! BRAVO and STANDING OVATION! THANK YOU! Looking foward to the future and I'll be a lifetime supporter."
1357,9/2/2015,5,"Haven't been to SeaWorld in years. Awesome that they offer discounted tickets during the week, we paid $50 to go on a Wednesday instead of $89! Just me and my fiancÃ© went and had a blast - no kids needed :) One thing I do wish is that they could set up some sort of shade for people when watching the shows. It was only 75 degrees today but it's a bit warm sitting in the sun! Can't imagine doing this if it were any warmer. My favorite part was feeding the bat rays. It was nice to change things up and feel like a kid again!"
1358,12/5/2015,3,"I used to love taking my daughter to Seaworld during Christmas time. We love that they still call it a ""Christmas"" celebration. However, they have removed some of the holiday ""joy"" by not providing Snow World this year. It was a guest favorite and a bad move by Seaworld, who has also gotten rid of one of their biggest attractions: ""Shamu"" shows. My daughter is crying as we speak and doesn't want to go to SeaWorld anymore. She was really looking forward to the snow since it is not an experience easily had in sounthern California Seaworld blames it on the ""drought"". The snow area is only about 50 feet in diameter. I think SeaWorld is just being cheap and for the first time in 5 years I am considering cancelling our memberships. I you have never visited before I think it is worth a visit but it will be far less magical than the visits we got to experience in the past years. If you have visited in the past a repeat visit will be disappointing. SeaWorld is going down the you know what.Oh yea and in exchange for taking away some of the best attractions SeaWorld has upped the price of its dining pass (from $24.99 to $34.99) with no difference in food offerings and increased its membership fees in the past 2 years since ownership changes. We miss the old SeaWorld!"
1359,7/5/2016,4,"We took our toddler to Seaworld on 4th of July weekend. He enjoyed Elmo's World and was able to ride the fishes and spinning ride. The food consists of too much of the same items: fried chicken nuggets and french fries. They need to revamp their menus. Toward the final hours, we were able to see the dolphins swim near us while talking to a trainer. This was all impromptu which made it extra cool."
1360,9/5/2015,5,"We are pass members, have been for over 10 years and will continue as long as we can. Aside from the great park, atmosphere and work that they do, I really feel that we get a great value for or membership. The free parking pays for the pass itself! Then the additional discount throughout the park adds to it. We are also members to the zoo and we definitely get more value as members at sea world. If you visit, or would visit, more than twice a year, get the pass! Â Plus you get great gifts throughout the year!"
1361,6/13/2015,5,"Absolutely LOVE SeaWorld! I will keep on renewing my passes until I have kids of my own and until my kids have kids of their own! Friendly employees greeted us everywhere with a smile. All day dinning wristband is definitely worth it. It is clear how much the animal trainers love and care for their animals. Learned from a woman in the rescue team that since the oil spill in Santa Barbra they have reached rescuing 1,000 sea animals and its only half way through the year! Last year they were at a little over 1,000 rescues by the end of the year! That is so awesome and makes me happy to hear. I will always be a SeaWorld supporter!"
1362,9/11/2011,5,"I love the shows!!!! This place is awesome for anyone that likes shows. Families, couples, whatever it is its very entertaining. We went to the Shamu show, pet show, Water World, and the dolphin/whale/bird.. I don't remember all the names. I think there was another one we had gone too but it's already been a week and my memory has slipped haha. You WILL get wet in the ""soak zones.""The rides are fun! If you're not looking to get wet don't go on Journey to Atlantis or the River Raft ride (the name slips my mind). The $5 driers do not do anything to help so don't waste your money. The Journey to Atlantis doesn't always get you soaked, we sat in the front and we got pretty wet.. it takes you down 2 hills that really get you wet but it's fun! The River ride either gets you wet or soaked and we got soakkkkeedddddd. I got stuck right under the waterfall and I was done ha. Afterwards we paid a quarter to shoot water at people :)Decent priced snack foods, we bought the popcorn bucket to refill, which we never did but still a good idea. Definitely get a map! It shows all the times on the back for the different animal shows. Have fun!!!"
1363,7/3/2012,3,"I was lucky that I got great discount tickets from work, and the weather was perfect.. 75 degrees with a constant cool breeze. Â If you're lazy like me, pay the extra monty and park in VIP/ preferred. Yes its $19 to park VIP but even with preferred, its a small hike to the main entrance.The map of the park is a little confusing, and I didn't realize that some entrance to the rides are inside the gift store.. and they spit you back out into the gift store. Â The reason for the three stars is the Manta Ride. Â It wasn't until I got to the entrance that they said NO Backpacks and I had to spend $1.25 for a locker. Â Really? OK if there's no backpack (or purses) then at least offer us a locker which is free. Â OMG each person who has to check in their pack spends $1.25 for a 2 minute ride ... outrageous. The Cirque Du Mer is a total rip off of Cirque Du soleil, down to the ribbons, costumes, and bounce from the roof. Â But.. its part of the admission, and lucky not an added cost.As for the animals, its always nice to see them up close. Â That's the only saving grace from not giving this place 2 stars."
1364,10/17/2013,5,There is no other attraction like sea world!!! The shows are impressive especially the blue horizons dolphin and pilot whale show! I bought a season pass and have already used it almost 20 times this year!!! Every time is different and it's so cool to be able to touch the dolphins and interact with them. I highly recommend sea world as a must. The price is very reasonable for what you get! You just won't get the San Diego experience without visiting this wonderful place at least once on your trip! I recommend more though!!
1365,5/20/2012,3,"We bought tickets for SeaWorld online and they were $20 cheaper and we didn't have to wait long in line to get in. Â I would recommend this for a day pass, it was $53 instead of $73. Â If you want to come more than one day, there is a 7 day pass that I could have bought at the hotel $66. Â Parking wasn't cheap at $14 though.We went early for the Shamu show and got good seats but we waited about 25 minutes for a 25 minute show. Â The show wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Â Next was the dolphin show (which including birds flying and acrobats). Â It wasn't very good and we left early. Â The sea lion show was funny and cute, I enjoyed it the best. Â Each show is about 20 minutes long but it's good to go about 10-15 minutes early to get good seats. Â In between the shows, we saw aquariums, shark exhibit, sea turtles, and penguins. Â The exhibits weren't as elaborate as I hoped for.There is a large play area for kids with rides and toys where families could spend a full day. Â There are a few rides for adults too where you get wet so it's best to go at the beginning of your stay so you can dry off. Â There are many washrooms around and food areas. Â There's the typical hot dogs, drinks, popcorn, nachos, and churros but not cheap. Â Best to bring your own water bottle and a few snacks. Â They do check your bag upon entry so I'm not sure if they will take away any food items.For $53, I won't be back until I have kids with me and then it would be more worth the money."
1366,6/5/2015,5,"I have always loved SeaWorld. Â The animal shows are great. Â I am grateful for the good SeaWorld does with their research and rescues. Â And - I have to say that, after being there last week, my new favorite attraction at SeaWorld is BIFF!!! Â He is fantastic!"
1367,12/11/2013,3,"Seaworld is pretty much as I remember it as a kid. Â Been going every 5 years or so for the past 30 years. Â  I had the Silver Pass (don't think they have this anymore) so I was able to go during the regular season, Halloween and Christmas. Â I enjoyed it all 3 times but there isn't really a ton to see. Â However, I definitely got my money's worth with the buy a day get a year free promotion they always have. Â  Christmas is more unique in that they switch up the shows and you can feel the xmas vibe. Â Halloween is fun too, but mostly if you have kids (free candy!).I've seen Blackfish, and I honestly think Seaworld or similar type establishments will soon be a memory of the past. Â Things will definitely change, eventually. Â Come while it's still around!"
1368,7/27/2015,4,"Pretty fun place. I love all the animals and shows they have. Not so much for thrill but good for the kids and any animal lover, they have tons of different animals like dolphins, porcupines, macaws, sloths and a ton more. My favorite show was the pets rule show , it was really great. If you want to spend a day walking and watching shows with the kids or your family it's definitely a great place, if you are looking for crazy roller coaster rides, this is not the place, regardless still a fun place!"
1369,5/10/2015,2,Annual season pass holders. My daughter's pass is at school with her teacher. We decided to come for Mother's Day. They closed their membership line at noon (much earlier than normal) and we now have to wait in a long regular ticket line. I even politely asked Â a staff member for help to no avail. 30 minutes wasted. Not cool sea world. We buy 6 annual passes a year with parking. Not next year. Customer service is not terrific. Our money is better spent elsewhere.
1370,6/2/2015,5,Sea World is a great place to see and learn about animals you normally could never see in the wild. The employees do great work caring for their animals and they even help local sea life that are sick or injured. I can't praise Sea World enough. Great job guys!
1371,6/28/2017,3,"The park & every single bathroom was so clean. The cleanliness of the park aside, I don't ever see myself coming back to Sea World unless I have kids due to the treatment of the animals. Although during the shows they seem excited while performing, the water areas they are kept in are so small for them and they are usually left in the blistering sun. Saddens me what companies are willing to do to animals for money... cannot wait until this place is shut down."
1372,2/23/2015,1,"Let me start off by saying I was born in raised in Point Loma. I grew up sailing and in the water. I see first hand what seaworld does as far as rescuing sea animals in distress. I even watched blackfish, before I purchased my annual pass, I can understand any company having some disgruntled employees make a video. Based on the customer service I have been receiving I would even like a refund on my annual pass. Most recently with the ""customer service supervisor"" named Yolanda. It seems customer service and any type of management position is given out by RAFFLE to whoever puts their name in a HAT. I told this supervisor based on the customer service I received I would no longer be renewing my pass, or my husbands, and I would discourage any friends or family members from getting passes. She said ""based on that statement [she] would have to end the call."" Â ATTN: SEAWORLD THESE CALLS ARE RECORDED LISTEN TO IT YOURSELF. I was so confused, I didnt cuss, threaten or say anything inappropriate, apparently any conversation you have with a Seaworld employee follows the ethical guidelines of Castro-style COMMUNISM. By me saying that I would be sure to warn others about the terrible customer service, she is allowed to hang up? An apology and genuine customer service go a long way. And this place seriously lacks this."
1373,5/31/2015,5,"No need to explain, we all know Sea World is a lot of fun. It's so amazing what some of these sea animals can do. The sea lion and dolphin shows are my favorite. The shamu show is not what it used to be because of the incident that happened couple years back, I guess. Less tricks, and the instructor does not get in the water with the whales. I was never a big fan but it does matter to others. Tip: unless you want to get soaked in water, definitely use ponchos for all the water rides."
1374,3/31/2016,5,"I hadn't been to Sea World in years and was pleasantly surprised to see that what was great about it hadn't changed and that they've added some wonderful rides for kids of all ages to enjoy. The shows are great, there's lots of fun merch to purch and you'll learn a lot on your stay. Â I was struck by how pretty the park is and found the food to be above average. A tip: bring wipes if you plan to interact with animals in the touch tanks, put your hands on the glass viewing areas, etc., etc. because while there are washing stations, they can back up/wait times.Our group bought the all day dining option and it was worth every penny. We managed to dine all over the park, tried a variety of foods (most locations offer the same desserts) and liked everything we had. Things like small side salads, slices of watermelon, salmon penne pasta. The chocolate cake was a real treat. Very flavorful. We also did the front of the line option but on the cool, overcast day we went, it really wasn't necessary. I would imagine on a hot summer day, it could be quite crowded and useful though. I loved the coasters, rode Atlantis twice and thought Manta was the best ride in the park. Fantastic. Buy a cheap poncho at the dollar store beforehand; you will need it for the rapids ride as you will get wet! Plan your day with the must-sees and the must-dos because unless you're there right when it opens and stay late, it can be difficult to see it all and truly enjoy it. The Pet Show is great!The interactive feeding areas were a lot of fun but five bucks is a bit pricey to feed the rays. More affordable feeding options are available for the flamingoes. If you plan to stay until closing, I suggest you spring the extra five bucks for premier parking instead; we got there right when the park opened and literally parked right in front of the entrance and at the end of the day, it was fantastic to walk over and open the car door so two tired kids could climb right in. The main disappointment was the extremely slow service at the hamburger place. Overall, service at all the restaurants was on the slow side. I understand the need to save money by under hiring but in today's park world and especially competitive Southern California, this Â needs to be addressed. Also, the photo key option. There should be a more reasonably priced option to purchase all the digital downloads. I doubt few people will bite given the high price, however, if you buy a front of the line pass with dine all day option, you will receive a free souvenir photo. That was great! I would suggest a Sea World employee roam the park and offer to take photos with visitor's cameras. I noticed a great many groups (some international visitors) and it would be such a gracious thing to have someone offering to take photos at popular spots. I know it's not an income generating thing and would probably cut into the pay photos a bit but after paying for parking, paying for admission, etc., it would be a nice little touch for guests that will remain in their memory. Or pass out fish erasers to the kids or something. Just something little and memorable. I was sad that the sky tram no longer goes to the Atlantis restaurant (shuttered and now a retail store for auto parts I think) but at least the tram offers a lovely ride over the bay and relaxing way to enjoy the sunset in San Diego. The signage to the sloth enclosure needs to be called out more (also on the map) because they are popular with children and easily missed. Otter exhibit is hard to see well. There's alot to see and you'll be doing alot of walking so wear comfy shoes. This is a great park worth visiting especially if you have children."
1375,2/1/2015,5,This place is great for kids and family's ! There extremely kid friendly and have great shows to entertain everyone :)
1376,7/10/2016,4,"Just took my kids here (7-9-16) for the first time. Â I went as a kid but haven't been back since the early 90s. Â My husband and I are both teachers so we got free passes for the year plus single-day tickets for my in-laws. Â THANK YOU SEA WORLD FOR SUPPORTING TEACHERS!!! My 3 year old had a blast. The shows and exhibits were so fun. She LOVED the Arctic exhibit with the Belugas, Walrus, and Polar bears. The Sesame Street area was perfect for her age. Â We went on a Saturday in July and there were very short lines for all of the rides! I had to take a star away for the food. Â It was not very good and way overpriced. I expect to pay more for food at an amusement park but the food was REALY bad. We ate at a place called Calypso Smokehouse (I think that's what it's called). Â They serve hot dogs but don't have mustard. Â The give you dinner rolls with your meal but have no butter. Â The ""smoked"" chicken was very bland and had no flavor. Â The tater tots were so overcooked they were brown on the inside. Â They looked like they'd been under a heat lamp since the day before. Â To feed my husband and I and our 3 yr old (nothing for the baby) cost us almost $60. Â And we just picked at it and threw most of it away.So minus the food fiasco, Sea World was a great place to spend the day and make memories with your kids. Â I'm aware of the Blackfish movement and am very careful not to support a place that I feel is abusing animals. Â I don't feel like sea world is one of those places. I think the staff and trainers are passionate about their animals and do all they can to keep them healthy and happy. I feel that exhibiting them for people help us to learn about them and respect their majesty in the wild. Â Just my opinion."
1377,1/11/2016,2,"Sea World has gone downhill. Â The shows seem much shorter than they were five years ago and the trainers don't seem to be that engaged with the exception of the guy ""Biff"" at the otter show. Â He was super funny and really the only highlight of the day. Â The sardines for the sea lions have shrunk considerably! Â Security also needs to be tightened up. Â They should not allow backpacks or any sort of bags into the park. Â A young kid was checking the woman's ginormous bag in front of me and she could have gotten away with almost anything in there. Â It's time to bring security into 2016 and install metal detectors!"
1378,4/2/2013,3,"Haven't been here since I was in elementary school! Now I'm a true San Diegan :) It was nice having such a variety of shows and interactive exhibits. One Ocean is a must-see, but the Blue Horizons show was a bit overboard. Prepare yourself for standard theme park expensive food that isn't worth it... and if you're planning to eat more than two meals there, consider buying the All Day Dining Deal for $33 (adults) and $17 (3-9 years). Parking = $15.Must do's: touch dolphins at Dolphin Point, touch stingrays, see the sharks in a tunnel at Shark Encounter, ride the new rollercoaster Manta. Get there EARLY! And it's buy a day, get the rest of 2013 free."
1379,8/11/2014,5,"This was my first visit to the park and I Â was very impressed! The Shamu show was AMAZING. I was fascinated at how smart these animals are. There isn't very many rides to go on but there is a lot to see my kids loved the dolphin expo and the turtle reef. We had lunch at the Dine with Shamu restaurant which includes a buffet lunch with a ""show"". basically you're eating in front on a glass wall were you can see the whales. The only thing i was disappointed with was the food at the buffet there wasn't very many options and what they did have wasn't very good at all. You do have to reserve online and the cost is $30 per person children are $17 and very small children are free. We also purchased a souvenir cup for $11 which isn't bad compare to Disneyland $18. you can also refill them as much as you want for only $1. I will definitely be returning here i highly recommend it."
1380,5/20/2015,4,"I get a butt load of criticism for going to Sea World.... We have a Fun Pass.I still go, the kids enjoy it.I bring my 3 year old and 6 year old.I would definitely recommend you buy the dine all day wrist band, I mean food there is already expensive, so you might as well spend $35.00 and all that your little heart desires. You can actually get the dine all day deal for $30 if you buy it online. Keep in mind you cannot buy this deal the same day of, you have to buy it at least the day before.It can get pretty packed on Saturdays, but the amusement park is relatively small. Customer service is great, we paid 6 dollars to take pictures in their little photo booth and their camera was blurry and angled incorrectly. I spoke to the manager at guest services and she gave us a whole bunch of complimentary tickets for various things..... oh and when you sit in the splash zone.... expect to get splashed. Heavily."
1381,10/28/2015,5,"I watched blackfish before going here lol blackfish is such a joke. Â Anyways I came here with my girl for our 6 year anniversary, she loves animals, last year I took her to the zoo, this year to sea world, honestly we had so much fun. We got here once it opened and the first thing we did was went into the restaurant/bar (yes we drinkingat 10 am) had a few samplers and then we were on our way. We were like grown kids enjoying everything, the great thing is that it was not that busy so we got to see everything by 4 pm. Definitely a fun experience and cant wait to do it again"
1382,6/9/2017,4,"Went back to SeaWorld this year and there have been some changes for sure. First of all, I'm sad to see the Shamu show go. Think SeaWorld got a raw deal on that whole thing. I truly believe that it was more political than factual. But it looks like this changed the parks direction for the good. They have added Ocean Explorer for kids and I really like it. Just perfect for the 8 and under crowd and well done. It is very similar to Camp Snoopy at Knotts. My daughter enjoyed it very much. This is the direction SeaWorld needs to go: more ocean themed rides. This will increase there attendance no doubt. Sure, they still need to have animals, but this should not be the main theme anymore. It should be a mixture of animals and rides. They need to update the Sesame Street area desperately. It is old and worn. Keep the theme and the rides that are there, but needs a makeover. Also, ditch the carnival games if you can't make them free. Come on, we paid a lot to get in already! There is a reason you don't see many people at the games. Things are improving at SeaWorld for the better. That's why I bought my season pass and will be back."
1383,3/29/2013,2,"The marine mammal shows are good but the animals themselves are upstaged by humans dancing around and performing acrobatics in some shows.The worst part is the food. Â Do not expect food that is good, and don't even think about going into the restaurants. Â The restaurant food is overpriced (even with the all-day-dine wristband scam). Â What's worse, the meat in the entres, such as the patty in the hamburgers and the ribs in the over-priced baby back ribs, is just at room temperature. Â It's not hot and it's not cold. Â Frankly, I should have been more careful, because that's a great environment for salmonella and other types of food poisoning.Also, the restaurants are buffet arrangements and the lines are awful. Â Today we waited 45 minutes in line, standing, before we finally got to select our food and go eat it. Â Ridiculous.I was disappointed in the food as you can tell. Â The park itself is ok and they don't let you bring in your own food, so plan to be careful about what food you choose to buy and check it for temperature (for food that should be hot) before leaving the cash register or serving line."
1384,7/4/2016,5,"I always love going to SeaWorld, it is a fun park for everyone. There are a few rides that are even for adults, our favorite is the Manta Ray, and it is a lot faster then you would think. The shows are very informative and educational along with being very fun. If you live in San Diego or are visiting with out without kids, it is fun for everyone."
1385,7/3/2017,5,"Our family (my, my husband and 5 kids) had a blast at Sea World! We came as part of our vacation to San Diego. It would have been nice to have two days to do everything there but we were still able to feel like we had a full experience in our 7 hours there. The shows were so fun, especially the sea lion show. The shows were good about explaining all that Sea World does to care for and research marine wildlife. My kids enjoyed the rides and there was something for all of my kids to get a thrill from. The Manta was the first roller coaster my boys (age 10 & 7) had been on and one was pretty freaked out by it but the other LOVED it, lol! The Sesame Street play/ride area was so fun for my all my kids but especially my littler ones (ages 5 & 3)! We were there on a Friday and there was a good sized crowd but the wait times for the rides wasn't long at all and there was plenty of seating at all the shows we went to. The food was okay, could be better. The child swap feature on a few of the rides was really nice for us to all go on the rides! The staff was friendly and helpful for the most part; also could have been a bit better. We were glad we had brought light jackets as it got a bit chilly as the sun went down. We were glad we paid the little bit extra for the close parking. All in all we loved our day at Sea World!"
1386,11/27/2015,3,"Went here with my wife and 2 year old last month on a Friday. Â The place was practically empty, the documentary has really taken a toll with seawolrd. Â Although it was great that there were no lines on any rides, everything seems a bit outdated. Â We did watch the orca show and the format has changed dramatically from when I first visited seaworld over 20 years ago. Â The orcas will now just swim around and splash the audience (nothing else and it was about 15 minutes long). Â Very tamed. Â I am all for that because I too rather have them free then in a park. Â However, if you are only going to have them swim around, I rather it be an exhibit then a one time a day show. Â All in all, it really seems like Seaworld is nearing it's end as an amusement park."
1387,12/28/2015,4,"We went and had a great time! I hadn't been to Sea World since I was in middle school and that was the one in FL. Place was very clean and the interaction with the animals were very cool. As was all the shows we seen, its different seeing the animals and shows as a adult."
1388,9/22/2015,4,"Growing up I always wanted to go to Sea world , to see Shamu the whale . My family never had the money to take us there, so fast forward 30 years later I'm bringing my son here so we both can enjoy it together. A 90 minute drive from Anaheim , once we arrived there was a huge parking lot , weather was over cast . First impressions of park , seemed a little dated could use a paint job and a more modernization look. Very clean, great staff, all the animals looked very healthy and happy."
1389,4/25/2015,5,"I will always respect Sea World and what they actually stand for. You get one jerk that goes and creates something that is so one sided and all the idiots follow. Do your own research and see that they are saving so many. You can't take an animal that may get bred in captivity and just let it go out in the wild. We will always come back here and always love what you guys do. Stupid sensitive, ignorant people ruin everything."
1390,5/4/2015,4,"Surprisingly a lot more fun than I thought. I had free tickets so I figured why not. The animals were very cool and the shows were entertaining. I expected it to be more for kids but as an adult I had a great time. Â The shamu show at night was impressive. Â Controversy aside, it's a pretty awesome theme park."
1391,2/7/2017,2,"I was last here about 20 years ago in 1996 with my children. Â Now I visited with my 30 year old daughter and her 16 month old daughter. Â I have to say, the park has changed hardly at all. Â It looks very dated and uninspired. Â We happened to be there on super bowl Sunday which meant we had the park to ourselves and it was nice because we didn't have any crowds. Â BUT, the food was poor, the shows tired and the experience worn out. Â I have no plan to revisit anytime soon. Â Maybe this sort of park is no longer attractive and relative. Â It's also very expensive - crappy hotdogs for too much money and out of date surroundings."
1392,5/22/2016,5,"We haven't been to sea world for about Â 10 years, we were here and went for 2 days and WOW! It was great! The staff from the dog kennel ( they have 10$ for a day) walking in to the shows, food and new rides were excellent! Â I would recommend sea world to my friends and family had a great time learning about sea life, My 8 year old loved it specially the splash zones!Bring extra clothes and prepare for some fun!!:):):)"
1393,10/2/2015,3,The ol girl ain't what she used to be. We went on a Friday and most of the food and drink stations were closed. The shows only took place 2x a day so no way to see everything. Shamu only took place 1x. Absolutely not worth the $100 admission based on the above.
1394,4/20/2014,4,"Brought the kids for a day of fun. It wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be for a Saturday. Overall good experience. My kids enjoyed themselves. I enjoyed the dolphin and shame shows. 2 things I didn't like. During the first dolphin interaction, the trainer looked at my kids and moved on to the kids next to them to give them fish to feed the dolphins...the other kids were all Caucasian. Hope that was just a coincidence and not prejudice. I also noticed that the dolphins and whales had scratches all over them. I really hope they aren't being abused!!!"
1395,6/17/2013,3,"A playful devil in sheep's clothes, SeaWorld is a for profit organization that makes a strong effort to be a conservationist organization. They straddle the camps of capitalism and conservationism pretty well, but the for-profit side rears its head more frequently than the former. The increasing number of rides SeaWorld is installing is a reminder of their continual efforts to entice people into their park and make a profit. What made me feel ill at ease was the gift shops at the end of every exhibit, and the nearly compulsory pictures they take as you enter the park and ride the sky cabin. It's hard to justify conservation when a company encourages spending money on more and more stuff that clutters our personal lives. Any major park delivers the same message, ""your visit with us is incomplete and your memories will fade faster if you don't buy something from our park.""However, I do get a sense they care for their animals and want to leave a legacy. Lastly, the shows are mildly entertaining. The metal benches and lack of covering enhances the sun's heat inside the amphitheaters. The biggest let down was the Shamu show. All a guest sees during the show are trainers running around the perimeter of the tank, flapping their arms signaling the whales to jump, splash or wave their fins, and that is it. It is not educational (no one trainer really talks during the show; it's all music) and the music is awful. For being their showcase, the Shamu show is the most listless in the park.If you only have one day to spend in San Diego and your choice is the zoo or SeaWorld, go to SeaWorld if you have kids and go to the zoo if you are an adult. The zoo is far more beautiful to visit, and they have more animals."
1396,7/10/2017,1,"So me and my family had never been to seaworld before. We heard about a promotion for military, and we decided to give it a shot. We went to the seaworld site, and it directed us to a page where you verify you're military. OK no problem..except that it sends you on an endless loop. You login to verify your military and then it sends you back to the seaworld site. You click on military discounts and it sends you back to the verification page. BTW we had 2 people on the Camp Pendleton military base helping us, who had actually done this before and they never had this problem. Now the reason I'm giving them 1 star is we called Seaworld to ask for help. It was a 30 minute wait. We selected the option to have them call us back. They never did."
1397,1/21/2016,5,I had a wonderful time! Sea world is so well thought out! The animals are beautiful! And it's so mother friendly!!!
1398,8/6/2015,5,"Always an adventure. This year we got the all day dining deal, was pretty cool. Shipwreck cafe has the best food. Hubs and I tried 3 of the 4 locations, which was a lot of work. Mama's pizza looked like microwave pizza so we passed. I will say that unless you arrive early and stay the FULL day its probably not a great deal. Each place has meals for about 16$ which if you just buy it, you can share. So at $35 you have to eat at least 2x to get your money worth. The meals are designed to keep you full so you only go once. Cafe 64 was good, the staff was kind of rude. There is not a whole lot of instruction on how it works or what you can order. Basically every line says 3 items total, entree (ribs not included but sampler is), side OR dessert, drink(includes bottled water which is awesome if there is no line when you walk by, beats paying 2.99 for Dasani, which is like the worst bottled water ever). You could get a side, dessert, and a drink. or 2 sides and a drink, or 3 desserts, but no sharing. They don't really seem to want to help. It would be great if the just attatched a logo to the window with what it is, (entree, side, dessert). You're left with just a kind of go with the flow idea. Lines depend on when you go, we planned ours around traditional eating times. 11,340, 630.At Cafe 64 you only get 4 items on your burger... lettuce tomato ketchup pickles... no cheese. Â  I realized too late and had a burger with no cheese. and the lady gave me attitude when i asked for it. ok, Ill throw this out and be back in your face in 1 minute... just saying.Calypso Smokehouse was awful, the absolutely only thing I liked was my roll. I got the sampler so I did get to try the ribs, fatty, dry, boring. Hubs got the chicken, it was also dry. Shipwreck Cafe was amazing,I had the bold tacos which was fish and shrimp black beans pico sour cream yum. came with rice. Hubs got chicken and chips, he would have prefered fries no option. Â This seemed like the best place to get food since the entree has a side*(chips and rice in our meals.) Other sides were fruit cups or salad. or dessert. The desserts are the same at every location, cake(carrot, chocolate,red velvet), cheesecake(carmel, chocolate), cupcake, shamu cookie (this is for kids, as an adult its disgusting). That is all I remember.If you are a snacker the deal is a bad idea. we could have shared a turkey leg and a nutella crepe and been fine.The shows havent changed much in years, and some of the animals are looking sad. There were not any visible starfish, something about a virus and them having to move. The rides are fun, wish there were more. I know our kids would have had a lot of fun so next time we will take them."
1399,1/11/2012,5,"I splurged and got the 2 year Platinum Pass (which includes VIP seating, preferred parking and discounts on food and merchandise). I decided I am going to use this pass, unlike my zoo pass which collected dust - and I am so stoked. It is so much fun for my toddlers!They have a Sesame Street wonderland, with everything from spinning teacups to a ""dumbo"" type ride featuring Elmo. They have fun jumpy things for babies and bigger kids, and just a tom sawyer-esque climbing, bridge, slide paradise! If you never make it to see a show, or ride any other rides, you can spend awhile in this section alone.It's always a beautiful day at Sea World."
1400,1/27/2012,5,"Do the Interactive visit with the Beluga Whales. Â You get to feed a walrus, which is so fantastic. Â Obie Â slurpes the food into his mouth and the sound is so funny. Â  You get to go behind the scenes and see Polar Bears, Arctic Foxes and the baby Beluga. Â The guides you have with you are highly knowledgable and provide lots on great information. Â I even got a kiss from a Beluga. Check my uploaded pics!Don't get me wrong...I went in knowing Belugas live in very cold water. The tank at Seaworld is between 50 and 55 degrees! But they provide wetsuits with booties and the excitement of what you are doing will keep you plenty warm. Â When you are all done you can have Â a hot shower (with toiletries and a souvenir towel) they even had a hair dryer.The video you can buy at the end had about 80 pictures taken by two professionals who were there during our visit. Well worth the price of the cd. Â If you have friends with you, they can take photos also.Highly recommend the Interactive visit at seaworld.Charlie, the only male Polar Bear at Seaworld died last week, so glad I was able to see him up close."
1401,6/17/2015,4,This seaworld is great. I'm from Ohio so I grew up with that Seaworld until it closed. I believe this one is layed out better than what I remember from Ohio. The trainers and all employees always seem to be very happy and helpful. My daighter loves coming here. Its a shame what theuve been going through since the release of blackfish. My daighter loves being able to interacy with the dolphins and talks about Shamu all the time. Â  Itd be a shame if they had to close.
1402,11/28/2015,5,"I had a blast at Sea World! I'm so glad I went before they stopped doing Orca shows completely. It's still a fun place and are really focused lately on educating people about the good work they do. If you're a ""Black Fish"" enthusiast, you should read Sea World's comments about it on their website."
1403,2/22/2015,4,"Yes, I've watched the movie Blackfish, but I won't go there with my review. It's close to my house and I'm tempted to ride my bike to avoid the $12 or $15 parking. To be honest, my favorite part of going to this SeaWorld is grabbing a beer, walking over to Shipwreck Rapids, cashing in a ton of dollars for quarters and unloading the water cannon on unsuspecting tourists. *6 water cannons live on the main pathway between the Shipwreck Rapids entrance and the Cirque de la Mer stadium.You will need a friend with you to assist with waving to the ride goers and also holding your adult beverage while you unload with the water cannon. Having a bad day or want to get back at the SeaWorld supporters? This is your best bet. You're welcome."
1404,10/13/2013,4,"My daughter says 5-stars. I say 3-stars. 4-stars it is...First time at Sea World San Diego and while it was a fun experience and lasted the day, it doesn't seem to be on par with the equivalents in Hawai'i and Florida. Â Rides were fun but unspectacular. Carnival options were also fun, but seemed an odd fit with an aquatic theme park. Whale show was great. But then the fun pet show again seemed like a forced fit with Sea World. And then there are more shopping options for Sea World trinkets than you can shake a flipper at.All that said, our five year-old daughter LOVED IT. Â Seriously. Â She was grinning and listing off her favorite things-- Whale show, petting the bat rays, Pet show, Atlantis, the Bay gondolas, et al. Â From her eyes, it was a remarkable experience. And that's what matters.At $79 an adult, at least kids are free in October... :o)"
1405,7/4/2017,1,"I would like to give a good review for SeaWorld because I know that they are trying to do good things for animals and I am a season pass holder, but I just cannot. Here's why. It's come to this. When you arrive to a show, you may not sit in ANY GOOD seats because they are now saved for ""premier guest"" = those who have paid a special and higher price. Leads me to question, ""What about those who paid for the ticket price to get into the park?"" They don't get to get good seats. It's all about more money. More, more, more! Greed! It's disgusting and it saddens me that SeaWorld stooped to this kind of greed. Shame on you SeaWorld!!"
1406,5/1/2012,4,"I love sea world because I grew up on it. Â I am going to try to give a review that is not totally biased because of that.Sea world is expensive if you are only paying for a day. Â It is a steal if you are paying for the day and getting the year for free. Â That is what my bf and I did this year. Â Now that i am an adult, after going twice, you have pretty much done it all. Â Don't get me wrong, I could still go a thousand more times and still have fun, but I can see my bf getting tired of it fast. Â The shamu show is fun although it used to be better before they realized that the show was about KILLER whales. Â The blue horizon show is a bit lacking and kinda cheesy (which I guess can be good for kids). Â The sea lion show is funny, only the first time.A big plus to Sea World is that they are adding rides. Â they already have Atlantis, but they are making a real roller coaster, called Manta, that will open this month.What makes me love sea world so much is the fact that I love learning about the animals. Â I don't think I will get a pass for next year, but maybe in a few years again."
1407,5/30/2017,5,My son loved it he absolutely loves animal and i got a whole package to five theme parks for 790 with the city pass we had a great time got to go to all the shows and for 35 per person i think you can get a all day dining the food wasnt the best and only thing i didnt like was the fact that everytime i ate i had to buy my son his meal not even in buffets they charge me for him he is 2 the least the could have done was that if a adult paid the infants get a free meal they dnt eat much so that would have been nice to have all in all my son had a blast for his birthday
1408,7/29/2014,4,"Their staff helped us when we needed it. Â We had one of the wheels break off my mom's wheelchair when we went to see the Sea Lion show. Â The staff brought us a rental to use for the rest of our visit for free. Â When we were done, we picked up our broken wheelchair at the rental center. Â A staff member pushed our broken one, while I pushed my mom in the rental, to our car in the parking lot. Â We saw the shows: One Ocean, Blue Horizons, Pets Rule, and The Sea Lion show. Â The dolphin stadium ramp is huge, like pushing a wheelchair up a cliff. We also went and saw the turtles and the penguins. Â Most of the Handicapped seats are in the splash zone. Â We brought with us a sipping cup from our previous visit. Â Glad we did, because their cups now are eleven dollars. Â If you take your cup to one of the stands, they will fill it up with water and ice for free."
1409,7/2/2017,1,"I purchased 2 all- inclusive 2 day passes. On the first day, all went well and we enjoyed all of the services for which I paid. On the second day, although I brought the tickets we were given and asked to use upon our return, I was told that these tickets were only for the first day and that although I purchased the two day all inclusive packages, they were only valid for 1 day . Yes this makes no sense. I was searching through my email trying to find my receipt to prove my case, but she informed me that Â i would need to find it (even though they have a record of this and photo of me on file from my first visit ) I asked for a manager and rather than the manager coming over to speak with me, the manager, named Michael told the rep (Hayu) I was speaking with to tell me that although we had purchased a 2 day all inclusive pass, it was only valid for one day. I asked the rep (Hayu) to pull up the passes I had purchased using my credit card and name. I also asked that she print them out. She looked at them and realized that both she and her manager were wrong and that indeed Â ""two day all inclusive package"" was printed on the tickets and that they were just that, all inclusive for two days. She said ok but that's was what my manager said, sorry. I was then sent to another long line to retell the events and get the passes. I am concerned that the manager Michael Â had no knowledge of the expensive packages I purchased and was content without investigating the situation, additionally, he gave misinformation and did not bother apologizing when he learned of this huge error. Had I not been persistent, I would have left being denied the services for which I paid. I am very concerned with my treatment and that of my guest and am disturbed that this is the image I will now have if Seaworld. I look forward to hearing from representatives from SeaWorld to learn how they will address this concern and prevent those like it in the future."
1410,8/8/2013,5,"last weekend, love the park, especially the shows except shame rocks because you get wet when you sit near the tank. They had good turkey leg and like the funnel cake. but there drinks were expensive."
1411,8/13/2015,4,"Prior to vacationing in San Diego I was googling things to do, sea world came up I said let me read the reviews since I've never been there and there was a mix of good and bad reviews and I didn't know what to do so I decided when I arrived in San Diego that I would figure it out, while I Â was in old town I was talking to a woman who worked at one of the Â  booths Â and she said to me don't do sea world it is a waste of time and money, my 9 year old daughter had then said to me"" mom just because she didn't like it there doesn't mean we won't "" I then replied back to her and Â said "" you're right let's try it out for ourselves""... well can I just say what a beautiful beautiful experience SeaWorld was my family and I had a great time , Â shows were wonderful we were able to get seats 123 just make sure you arrive on time or I should say 15 to 20 minutes earlier, all the animals we seen were just beautiful and so amazing I was in awe. Â  We got the dining pass for the day I don't really think that its worth the money unless you plan on eating all day long and when you're in the places that honor the dining pass its a very confusing process because you don't know what foods belong to the pass , you can only get certain stuff. I really wouldn't recommend the dining pass but that's just my opinion. I'm so glad we didn't listen to that woman and we decided to try SeaWorld for ourselves because it was just an amazing experience that my family and I Â will cherish for a long time !!!! Oh FYI we went on a Monday and it was not that packed and do the parking for 21_dollars you will be closer to the entrance Â its worth the extra 5dollars . Â have fun ."
1412,10/30/2011,4,"This place is cool! Â You can go on rides, see shows or see various sea life. Â The food isn't bad. Â I like the $29.99 all you can eat deal. Â I get there before lunch and have lunch. Â Then later in the afternoon I have dinner. Â The food I liked best are the bbq ribs, bbq chicken, red velvet cake, and chocolate covered Shamu cookie.I've been going during the Spooktacular celebration the last few years and it is lots of fun. Â There are lots of kids dressed up for Halloween and you get free candy!"
1413,6/5/2011,3,"I've been to this Sea World twice. I have also been to the one in Orlando, Florida. Compared to Sea World Orlando, this park is considerably smaller. Lot of attractions to choose from but limited in scope in comparision.Parking wasn't bad but it took us forever to finally pay our way inside the park. The food here is very expensive but that is typical of attractions like these. We went to the Sesame Street Bay of Play 3-D theater. Very cool experience and all of the children seemed to enjoy it. Went on a couple of rides and attractions. The Journey to Atlantis ride was underwhelming to me in comparison to the Orlando one but was still fun and a little scary. You will get wet though! Shipwreck Rapid was another wet but fun ride, especially when you get to the waterfall area. Wen't to see a few more attractions before endind the night at the Shamu Rocks show. I was wet enough so I sat near the top rather than close to the pool.It was very fun the both times I went. Make sure you have a lot of extra money because food, drinks and even snacks are pricey. You should have fun here though. I did"
1414,4/2/2015,4,I used to love Sea World and it was semi-relaxing on a weekday. Â Not anymore! Â They've added so many bells and whistles that it is SO CROWDED. Â Parking costs $16! Â And it took over an hour in line just to buy admission tickets! Â Add that to the price of admission $89 for adults and I'm not sure if it's worth it at all. Â The shows are still great and every once in a while there's a cool moment watching the animals but the price tag is quite high and you get the feeling that the private equity firm who owns this place is doing their best to make as much moola out of it as they can.
1415,12/9/2013,4,"love this place and the employees are allvery friendly. this park is really accommodating! restrooms are alwaysclean. the shows are awesome, as well as the rides!!! I just wish it was open longer:/ it was my first time to go for Christmas this year and it was soooo much fun making snowballs and the decorations were gorgeous! I love the deals here as well. they should have free refills at Disneyland too:/ I recommend to come here with kids or without!"
1416,6/25/2014,4,"Haven't been to sea world in four years, and at that time I had no kids. This time I took my 2 yr old . Started with the pets rule show which was really good! Definitely recommend seeing that show for sure . Then we hit the turtle exhibit. My little girl loved that, then we went to the manta exhibit where u can touch the mantas and feed them fish. Fun experience but the little one was afraid to touch them. We them hit the dolphin - pilot whale show which was good and then went to the Sesame Street kiddie area. Didn't get to see shamu but will go back this summer for sure. Go on a weekday the tickets are just 50$ for celebrating 50 years of sea world. Saves u almost $30!!"
1417,7/2/2011,2,"Eh. Â Sea World San Diego seems like it would be such a great place to go.. but it's not. Â Considering San Diego is a big vacation destination and a lot of people come here just to visit Sea World, it really should be a lot better than it is. Â So I will split my review up into price, entertainment, food, and overall experience/grounds.Price:It's not a cheap place to go. Â But, when you pay for a day, you can go back all year. Â You also have to pay for parking here, which isn't cheap.. and if you pay a few more dollars, you can go preferred and get a better spot. Â I think that paying for parking is sad, but if you're going to do it anyway, might as well go preferred because Sea World is a big park to walk around, and even though it may not seem bad when you're walking in, you'll want to save your tired feet when you're coming back.Entertainment:Well, the animals here are all cooped up in tanks of water similar to bathtubs. Â I feel really bad for the whales. Â The shows are fine, I guess. Â The Shamu show is pretty terrible. Â I couldn't take it seriously.. my entire party was laughing hysterically when they were trying to be serious. Â I felt bad, but I couldn't help it. Â They need to stick with the classic stuff. Â It worked well. Â I did the dolphin interaction a few years ago. Â I was pretty disappointed with it because there wasn't THAT much interaction with the dolphins. Â I recall being able to put a dead fish in its mouth once and touch it a couple times. Â The package didn't even include a photo that they took of you. Â I recall paying over $100 for photos. Â Kind of crazy. Â The rest of the shows are alright, but nothing spectacular.Food:Sea World has the most god-awful food in the entire universe. Â I can't even believe it. Â We've tried a lot of it because of pure disbelief.. I mean, how could a chocolate covered sugar cookie with whipped cream taste bad? Â Or how can that cupcake really make me want to gag.. and how can a simple sandwich make me want to throw myself in front of a bus? Â Well, they can.. and I've tried so many things there that I can honestly say the food is the worst food of theme park history. Â It is just plain bad.Overall experience/atmosphere:The grounds are very pretty.. and there are a couple of rides to go on. Â But there are waits for them... long waits. Â Because there's just not much to do at this Sea World. Â There is a pond where you can touch the starfish and other critters, and I often see unsupervised monsters.. I mean children.. picking them up and throwing them. Â It's really sad.I like what Sea World is set out to do.. I like that they want to help the ocean's wildlife. Â Afterall, without our oceans, where would we be? Â But the way they run this park is something that I don't agree with. Â I wish I had good things to say about Sea World.. and I wish I could visit more often to support them, but I just find the entire place to be more of a nightmare than a fun day out with friends and family."
1418,3/24/2016,3,"Hmm. This is borderline between 2 and 3 stars, I'll give them 3 because they made a hard corporate decision and are trying to do the right thing. I'm not certain the decision will actually help the company, or even necessarily the animals, in the long term. In the two shows my family attended (dolphins and whales) and in the live animal exhibits, they spent way too much time telling us about all the conservationist stuff they (supposedly--the claims are either vague or based on fantastically specific numbers to give the illusion of detail) do, and way too little time actually informing and entertaining. It's like the PR department hijacked all the scripts and the signage and the do-gooder rhetoric is too much. On the upside, it's pretty cool to see whales and dolphins at beck-and-call. And actually, the tiny suckerfish pond right in the entrance is surprisingly awesome: it's like having a hundred kittens smooching you at you at once. It's a very good aquarium, but having seen Denver and Atlanta's excellent aquariums at less than 1/3rd the price they need to be more than that. The rides are pretty good for what they are, you don't go for the rides. The 'cut the line' pass and CONSTANT upsell attempts are frustrating for those who 'only' bought the base $79 admission. So many times I stood in the middle of some plaza and saw 8 different establishments trying to sell me something, as I tried to find the 1 or two actual feature exhibits at that plaza. Yes, this is what these parks do, but Legoland the day before felt better. But then, they don't have to keep whales alive. Seaworld does. At least, for a little while longer..."
1419,5/10/2012,4,"I don't care how old you are, anyone can have fun at Sea World. My bf and I decided to go here on a whim while visiting San Diego for Old Town's Cinco De Mayo Festival. He had never been, and I went once when I was a child but I didn't remember much at all.We had a great time!Unfortunately, parking is a bit pricey ($14). At first glance, I also thought the tickets were expensive ($73); however, we purchased the Fun Card (same price) which allows you to enjoy unlimited general admission through Dec. 31, 2012. It's a great deal! We went a little late in the day, so we didn't have a chance to check out the entire park, but I definitely recommend the Dolphin Show and Shamu Show. It amazes me how talented the performers are, and how they're able to train the Dolphins and Whales to do really amazing things. Both are a must see. The Penguin exhibit was neat! The little Penguins are so cute! I just want to take one home with me. lolThe only down-side: I wish they had more snack vendors around. Other parks have snack stands at every corner, but we had to walk awhile before finding something. Once we did, it was a self-serve area with a few things to choose from. More options throughout the park would be much better.Overall, I think it's a great place for kids or couples or just about everyone. It's a nice day out in the lovely SD."
1420,12/18/2015,5,"Pleasantly surprised at what a clean, well run aquarium this was. Just enough variety in shows, education, and exhibits to be a great day out. Lots of helpful staff members everywhere who had the gracious hospitality of a nice resort more than a theme park. On par with Disneyland for clean environment, immersive themes, and friendly people. The animal handlers were all incredible too. They came off as loving the animals they worked with and being proud of what their friends from the animal world could do. Great job to the staff for keeping up the smiles and going above and beyond to care for guests and help them to have a great day out as a family!"
1421,4/9/2016,5,The shows were perfect. To watch the amazement in my toddlers eyes was priceless. She got to pet the dolphins and she pet every animal/fish in the petting zoo/pool. She was enamored with the whale show...she loved being splashed. Felt good to take her there since I hadn't been since I was about her age
1422,6/5/2017,2,"So I know the controversy over Blackfish, etc. Â It is noteworthy. Â The Orcas do not look very happy bobbing in their pen in the back of the killer whale show. These are top predators who roam the open ocean? Â As our president would say....Sad! Â However I took my GF and her son, 15, who had never seen Seaworld or Orcas, dolphins or other animals up close. Â The animals seem to be treated well but yes, it's kind of a bygone era of seeing animal shows for our entertainment. Â I guess that's why we skipped the zoo. Â Anyway, the park was not very crowded and we had a decent time. My real reason for the review here is Ocean Explorer. Â The new big deal ride! Â What a joke. Â This was the lamest thing I have seen since It's a Small World. Â We actually waited in line for this?? Â And not a short wait. Â Like 30 minutes of the slowest moving line. Â The operators didn't know what they were doing as we were asked to stand in one spot, then no over here, then no back here. Â They have so few cars running on this ride, it could be twice as many to get people through. It's ridiculous. I can't believe any theme park would put together a ride like this in this day and age. Â If you are over 5, you will not enjoy this lame excuse of an ""attraction"". Â If there is any line at all, don't bother! Â It's awful, lame and for 3 yr olds. It's kinda sad to see what has become of Sea World. Â It's okay for kids and first time visitors but I can't see us ever going back."
1423,12/19/2014,1,seeing fish and beautiful animals trapped in small pools makes me feel so claustrophobic for them. I liked the pet show and went here just to appease a friend hoping I would see something ok but it made me feel horrible supporting it. Â I love animals so I can't enjoy this. Â save your money and see animals in the wild and free
1424,2/19/2013,3,"Our family of 4 visited this week. Â We have 2 boys, ages 6 and 3. Â  The 3 shows that were active were great Â  They were the highlight of our trip! Â There was NO Shamu Show which just doesn't seem right for SeaWorld! Â The Madagascar 4D movie was also not running. Â  Â I would have given 4 Stars if we had the Shamu Show and 4D Movie.SkyTower was nice view. Â  Also did the SkyRide as well. Â  These were fine to do and low key.The food was not great.... I'd give 2 stars out of 5. Â  Â We ate at Stella's Kitchen and had 2 kids pizza/bread sticks and 2 adult pizzas. Â  Â NOT good. Â  Â Don't eat there!The positive is that the Manta had a very small line and we were able to get decent seats at all the shows.The Shark Encounter had the strangest congestion in it that we took an exit and didn't wait. Â  Â It became very uncomfortably crowded.We liked the Stingray pool.... the 3year old loved it. Â  Â We walked through and saw the Polar Bear, Walrus, Penguins, etc. Â The Sesame Street area was good for the 3 year old.... we saw a LOT of little kids in the park.The directional signage could be improved. Â  Â  Â We did use the iphone APP and it actually worked and gave updated Wait Times which was helpful. Â  Â We were able to find 20% off coupons if you had a Southwest Airlines Reward card. Â  Â That made us feel a little better about our less than optimal experience."
1425,8/1/2011,3,"I always love going to sea world, because of Shamu and all the other shows they have. Â Of all the times that I had visited, i've always been fully satisfied. Â It is a good thing that once a year the family can visit this place, but this year wasn't as good as how I'd come to.I cannot believe I never ever..realized how expensive everything inside is. Â I think our food cost almost two hundred dollars..My kids got each a souvenir that cost us $75..I am not gonna add the entrance fee that would have cost us about $300, because they offer military pass for the fam. once a year. Â You can spend a grand in this place in one day!!!! But anyways, the ""Shamu"" show wasn't as good as before, I guess because of that one incident that happened to another sea world..the trainers changed their performances. Â The Sea Lion show was good, my daughter laughed a lot. Â Their sesame street section is my fave. as well as my kids."
1426,3/15/2016,5,"Every time I go here, I fall in love with the park over agin. Every exhibit has so much interesting information and being able to see the animals up close really allows you to see how majestic they truly are. I only wished I lived closer so I could go there more often."
1427,11/16/2014,1,"I attended the pass members day for the Christmas season today. Â I must say it was a big disappoitment. Â The Animals Rule was the same tired show they do all years with different dialog. Â Very boring!The worst show was the Shamu show. Â The attempt at Christmas music was awful. Â The brass quartet that played before the show started was simply awful. Â They were off key, not together on most songs and were simply just noise. Â Save your money and fire them all now! Â Now we move to the singing during the show. Â The black lady that was screaming (I think it was suppose to be singing but was not) should be arrested for assualt on our ears. Â I don't go to Sea World to hear black people trying to be gospel singers, the chior with her was equally as bad.You should spend more of the show letting the Orcas perform and no time with the awful music.I would tell anyone thinking about going for the Christmas events to stay home or spend their money elsewhere."
1428,10/25/2011,4,"It's SeaWorld. Â It's a sterilized, family-friendly version of what marine life is all about.It's really simple. Â They have Shamu, dolphin shows, sea turtles, penguins, sea lions, sharks, and lots more. Â Sometimes there are activities you can do, such as feeding the sea lions. Â There are other attractions, such as the Sesame Street rides and playground where parents can take their children. Â There's that really tall tower that takes you to the top so you can see all of San Diego, and a few water rides as well. Â My favorite part is the Wild Arctic. Â Not only do you get to see beluga whales, polar bears, and walruses, but there's also a fun virtual ride that makes you feel like you're actually in the arcticI enjoy it a lot. Â I bought a one-year pass and haven't regretted it. Â The food selection could be a little more varied outside the typical hot dog-hamburger-fried chicken-salad meal, but that's not a big deal. Â Even if I see the same shows and exhibits over and over again, it's still a lot of fun."
1429,12/14/2015,4,"Very nice shows, especially at Halloween and Christmas. At Halloween kids can trick or treat there and get candy at different stations. The Shamoo show during the holidays is my husband and my favorite. We also like the former Clyde and Seymore show... not sure what it is currently called. Anyway, we have had many wonderful visits here. Thank you, SeaWorld."
1430,1/2/2017,2,Slow to open parking lanes and slow to open to ticket lines. Slow slow but the greetings were nice .
1431,10/13/2011,3,"Our day went something like this:We got in right at about opening, around 10:00. Â This affords you a pretty decent parking space, not too far from the entrance. Â We headed straight to the Orca stadium, ponchos in hand, to see the 11:30 show. Â We stood in line at the top entrance to the right of the stadium (facing the show), and we were like the 10th family in line. Â We got to sit smack dab in the center, up front in the splash zone. Â It was hot, but the great seats were worth it.The show started and there was a lot of video showing on the screens behind the water. Â I think they're trying to improve their image - saying we are all stewards of the earth and this and that, when really it seems like they're trying to atone for the death of that trainer last year and the confinement of the Orcas. Â I had mixed feelings. On one hand, ORCAS FREAKING RAWK!!! Â On the other hand, it's really depressing that these magnificently intelligent creatures are herded into a relatively small pool and forced to do stupid tricks to entertain us. Â But then I came to my senses and ooh-ed and aah-ed at the glorious mammals waving their fins like they're saying hi, splashing me with water and beaching themselves for my amusement.Next we rode on Shipwreck Rapids, which wasn't nearly as good as the rapids at Disneyland (but take ponchos if you're going because you'll get wet!). Â Then we went on the Bayside Skyride which was okay. Â We saw the sea stars and that was fun - my daughter really enjoyed picking them up), a few aquariums, the turtle cove, the shark tank, and the piranhas. Â We saw the dolphin feeding. Â We also took one of those silly riding on an orca pics, but it was fun. Â We missed the entire Sesame Street park but having come from Disneyland, I don't think we missed too much.Having been there, it's not on my list of must-returns but it was a fun thing to do."
1432,7/4/2015,5,"Very good place to spend with all family and kids, my wife and kids love it."
1433,11/22/2015,5,"We've been going to Sea World for 30+ years. Â Its always clean, well organized and the attendees seem to be more courteous than other parks. Â Great family park. Â Weather is always great in San Diego."
1434,3/23/2013,4,"The first night in my new place in San Diego I laid my head down to sleep and was soon jostled awake by the sound of loud booms. Heart racing, I looked outside and saw fireworks. What the heck?! I was new to SD and hadn't realized how close to Seaworld I actually lived. The nightly sounds of the fireworks would become the familiar signal that I should start getting ready for bed. :)It would be two and a half years before I actually went to Seaworld. As an adult with no kids, I never had much reason to put myself through the chaos. I finally went when I took on the the kiddos from my work out for a day trip. First, get the sea world app mainly for the map....this place is a maze! Even with a map I was constantly going in circles...maybe that's just my lack of any sense of direction. The fun card is great deal for residents. I can only stand amusement parks for a couple hours before I can't take it anymore. It's nice to go for a few hours and leave without worrying about ""getting my money's worth!"" The whole Shamu show thing was entertaining for both adult and kids. I don't think you can grow out of being in awe of such giant and intelligent creatures. Is it possible to be that jaded? We really liked the shark exhibit too. After seeing the whale sharks in the Georgia Aquarium, my bar has been set really high. This exhibit is pretty small, but the sharks are impressive enough to make up for that.I wouldn't try to do all of Seaworld in a day. Those are the families who are leaving at 10 and all their children are in tears and yelling and the parents are at their wits end with trying to get their money's worth and creating ""magical"" experiences. It would be magical if parents realized that their kids cannot hack a 12 hour day of theme park activities! If you are gluten free, I suggest pre-eating and bringing a protein bar or something. I wouldn't consider any of their restaurants to be a good option for gluten free."
1435,7/19/2013,3,"This is a great spot to go to with younger kids. They get to learn about sea life/artic life, there are some nice shows to watch with them, pretty decent simple rides. Maybe a bit expensive for what you get. We ended up purchasing the fun card, which is a good way to stretch your dollar if you are localish to SeaWorld. The kids loved the shows, loved the sesame street area and loved the ride rip tide."
1436,1/30/2011,5,"Oh, Sea World, Sea World... how i love and miss thee. Really, there is probably nothing I can add that hasn't already been said; yet I feel that I must emphasize the amazingness that is the SW Funnel Cake. Sea World Funnel Cake you make wanna scream... Superfragilisticexpialidocious ... because I can't quite put into words how awesome you are! I am not entirely sure which cafe makes and sells it; but ask any employee and they will point you in the right direction; or better yet, follow your nose. Superfragilisticexpialidocious.. (because you can't just say it once)."
1437,8/7/2011,4,"This is by far one of the neatest places I have ever been. I feel a little strange admitting this since it's obviously geared towards younger people, but it's a versatile park for any age. Everything from Journey to Atlantis to the One Ocean with Shamu. Everyone that works there is extremely cheerful and happy and always eager to help. Considering how many people actually visit Sea World, the parking situation is actually pretty efficient and not bad at all. The One Ocean show is so amazing; the fact that people can train a whale to do what they're capable of is just astonishing. Everyone should experience this wonderful place at least once in their lifetime. It features the many aspects of sea-life in one place and it features separate aquariums with fresh and salt water creatures that is just so informative. You'll be introduced to some pretty exotic (scary, even) under water creatures so be prepared. Insider tip: If you're in the military, they offer free admissions for you and your family once per year, so you absolutely have to take advantage of that if you're in the service."
1438,1/6/2015,5,"Best place to spend with friends, family and kids at any given time. Â I will continue to support SeaWorld for life."
1439,10/25/2012,5,"I like Seaworld. Â I like them even more because of the awesome ""discount"" they offer for military members. Â I've only been here a few times, never when I was a kid. Â The first time I was here I was in my twenties. Â When I saw Shamu I was disappointed. Â Somehow I imagined it would be humungous when I was a little kid. Â The show is super cool. Â The last time I was there, it was still super cool. Â I always like to sit right up front so that I get a little wet.. but not close enough so that I'm drenched.They've added a few more exhibits since my first visit here but the usuals are still there.. like the flamingo area.. and the whole penguin habitat. Â The shark and penguin areas are my favorites of the park. Â That, and the sea lions.I like this place more than The Aquarium of the Pacific."
1440,3/23/2015,3,"I love Shamu!!!!!! Surprisingly Seaworld was more than I had expected from a child. When I was a kid I only remembered boring shows and tons of sea life , after coming back after so many years has really changed my view of Sea World. As an adult, the shows are more informative instead of entertaining. You learn more about the each sea animal and get to see how active they are. It's definitely a to go place to hangout with your date. They have a lot of rides, shows, aquariums etc. Its really nice. I just wish the shows were more entertaining."
1441,10/16/2013,4,"Had a great time! Must see all the shows you can to make it worth the money. Dolphin encounter is worth it to stick around for, I got to pet a dolphin!"
1442,8/20/2013,5,My kids loved it! I loved it. Especially the Sea Otter & Walrus show. (Really funny). The kids loved it and ever since we left (June 2013) they've been asking to go back. Thinking of making the trip there soon. TIPS: Be Prepared!! It's a theme park so don't be surprised at their $$ for food and souvenirs!
1443,12/29/2015,4,Close to home and always delivering a Sea World Experience. A great spot to visit with guests and to catch the summertime fireworks (even though I'm gifted to see them nightly from my patio).
1444,3/19/2015,2,"This was my first SeaWorld experience and I have to say it was pretty lame.The place was run down, and about half the concession stands were closed. I'm guessing its due to off-peak season as it is March. But not sure if the run-down part is like this year round.The amount of sea life I saw is comparable to what you'd find at a really good aquarium or zoo, and DEFINITELY not worth $80+ per person. There are a handful of rides that appeal to young children. I don't advise bringing children here any older than 12.I didn't care for the park too much and was just really looking forward to the dolphin and shamu shows. Unfortunately both were pretty disappointing and it seems that the focus and ""entertainment"" was really all about trying to splash the audience which was sad. All I have to say is...great for really young kids and to kill a couple of hours, but please look for discounts as the full price is not worth it."
1445,7/7/2015,4,"Love seeing the animals and all the variety of shows (2 shamu shows, a pet show, dolphin show, sea lion show, cirq de la sea acrobat show). Now that I'm older I get a bit sad thinking that the animals don't have enough space to really stretch out Â I still love the exhibits and the shows and animals, but it is kinda sad to think about. Also, in the shows they don't do as big of tricks as they used to do (I.e. No shamu jumping to hit a ball high in the air and no trainers riding shamus back). Pack your own lunch and go eat in the car to save money"
1446,8/12/2013,5,"Wow! My 8-year old daughter and her friend loved it. Very well staffed and not as mobbed as I had feared. The show we liked the best was actually Pets Rule-funny, adorable, and supports the noble goal of getting people to adopt shelter Â pets."
1447,12/1/2014,4,"I was undecided on whether to go to Seaworld during my visit to San Diego due to the high price of admission ($86) plus parking ($16). I ended up going with friends. I found a coupon on retailmenot website for a discount $8 bucks (something is something). We had a great time! We went on a Monday and it worked out well because it was not crowded. We went to all the shows, had a chance to interact with the dolphins, and went on the Manta roller coaster ride twice. We got there one hour after the park opened and were able to fit in all the things we wanted to do. Whether the $86 for admission is worth it, honestly I don't know. We had a good time and enjoyed it but I still do believe that it's just too expensive for a single admission. I was in San Diego only for a few days so I went for it but if I lived here I would probably wait to get a better deal ( in the summer admissions on weekdays was only $50). Anyhow, all the staff were friendly and answered all of our questions. I agree with other reviews the map is confusing and signage around the park wasn't very helpful. Something I really liked was the funnel cake with strawberry glaze, whip cream and soft serve. Yum!"
1448,12/19/2013,4,The penguin exhibit smells like fish ass but is well worth the walk through they are some amazing little birds!!!
1449,4/7/2016,5,"I've been to sea world many times in the past. Tickets are really reasonably priced, you pay for a day and get the rest of the year free! Really enjoy the manta and journey to Atlantis ride, highly recommend going on those. Â I love dolphins so they are always a must see for me!"
1450,11/30/2014,5,"OMG!!! If you love wildlife or everything about ocean and sea creature life, you really have to check this place out. Â Can you say Shamu? Â Great place to take the whole family with you. Â A must see location when you are visiting California."
1451,8/8/2015,4,"We had a great time visitng, we bought the all day dining wrist bands for our family and made good use of them. Â The park is spacious and we found it highly educational. Â Lots of places to hide in the shade so your not burning in the sun. Only downfall there are about 3 rides in the park so the lines are very long. My niece did the dolphin experience $60 for 15 min, Â you where able to stand outside the dolphin area with a trainer while the trainer taught you to play with the dolphin while a photographer took pictures. Â After the experience you are given a card to take to the kiosk to purchase tickets, it was annoying to have to wait in line to view photos to only be told that the photographer has not returned to upload the pictures, Â sea world you missed out on getting that money for the pictures. Â No we where not going to wait around for the photographer to return. It was the end of the day we where spent."
1452,7/28/2016,1,"This place is the worst. Very poorly supervised, the people that did work there told outright lies about the animals and their enclosures. The ""educators"" we're more concerned about sending people to the shows than the protection and welfare of their animals. To sea world, their animals are an asset, not a mission. Unethical and cruel! I am ashamed we went there. Find anywhere else to go."
1453,4/2/2016,5,We love going to Seaworld. My kids loves the show and the ability to touch to sea life with their hands. We got the annual pass so we will be back soon!!
1454,4/15/2016,3,"When we visited, the stadium where dolphins shows are help was closed for renovation, and Journey to Atlantis was also closed. Â We didn't know these from websites or even map, and were disappointed. Â The shows were just okay, except for Orca show which was pretty good. Â But even for orca show, there were too much recorded video as opposed to live action.We liked other aspects of the park, especially since it was less crowded on the weekday we visited."
1455,1/6/2015,5,Happiest place on Earth....Strongly recommend the backstage passes and Quick Queue
1456,5/22/2017,1,This place is way different than my last visit 10 years ago. Killing whale doesn't have the show no more like used to. Â Direction inside the park is confused.
1457,9/28/2014,4,"I swam with dolphins today for $215! Then I paid for photos for $89! Overall I spent enough to afford a decent point and shoot camera, or three pricey body massages. It was worth it. I went with 2 of my friends and were the first group to go with a 10am appointment. A total of 11 people were there for this fintastic experience. We were split into 2 groups which was better but still felt less personal than it ought to at $215 a pop. The photos the photographer took were okay, I didn't like how ppl not my friends, were in the photos. Guess that's me being petty but someone picking their nose in the background while I'm walking the dolphin on water kinda sucks. Aside from that I touched, hugged, carried (with the help of my two friends), walked, rode and was splashed by one of four dolphins they had in the tank. It was a super fun experience that I probably won't do again but will definitely talk about and recommend. Seaworld itself is impressive. Super affordable compared to some places (ahem legoland's a rip!) and a very clean park with friendly and informative staff. All the animals appear to be happy and I didn't think of Blackfish once during my visit. I'll be back in a couple of years."
1458,1/6/2015,4,"Had a blast with my Husband! We really enjoyed the Orca show, feeding sea lions and petting Dolphins! Food was a little pricey and I think the park could be updated. I thought it would be a little bigger from the hype but nonetheless it was a great time!"
1459,12/5/2014,5,"I love Sea World. They do a lot of great things, saving sea animals etc. They have saved a lot of animals in San Diego who were stranded on the beach or injured. Besides that, the park is a blast, and very beautiful. I Â get a pass every year, get the one that includes parking! It's worth the extra money, because when you go, you do t have to spend any extra money. Â The best time to go is off season. You will practically have the place to yourself if you go in the winter or on a week day in the winter. I avoid it in the summer, too crowded for me. I like the helicopter ride the best. It's a virtual realty thing. The penguin counter and shark encounter are my other favorites."
1460,9/21/2014,1,"Only came here because my boyfriends mom got free tickets from her work. Waited in an unorganized line for a hour only to find out it's only for first responders for the fires not for nurses and doctors. They should have done their research before inviting all staff of hospitals because those are NURSES and DOCTORS. Not first responders. These doctors and nurses were at the hospital taking care of the fire victims but not technically ""first responders"". I honestly was ashamed to even come here in the first place after black fish. Literally waiting in another long line to get a refund for parking and the extra tickets we bought. Rip off! So beware of the ""free ticket"" scam, it'll save you a day and the trouble of dealing with idiots."
1461,7/6/2011,5,Worth the money you pay for entrance but not the crowd.. I guess it was untimely to go on 4th of July weekend and except to be non-crazy :) Â But we were still lucky to be the first in line for Shamu's show. Â youtube.com/watch?v=m7-Mâ€¦We arrived around 11AM and buying tickets from quick pay(or something) is faster.. by then the security guy says about 30K people in already :-o and expecting more as 4th of July weekend is THE most busiest time for SeaWorld. Â Shamu show was amazing.. I liked that they have several options to choose and time your visits for each show on the Map.
1462,5/16/2015,4,"The shows were good. Â I really liked the sea lion show the best. Â It was comical and fun. Â The trainers maxe it work. Â The Shamu is always amazing. Â I was underwhelmed with the dolphin show. Â There is no need for all the theatrics. Â I didn't go to see a story line. Â Maybe it is becsuse i have seen some great dolphin shows. Â All in all, the animals are majestic and everyone needs to go once in their life time."
1463,3/29/2016,3,"Our experience wasn't the best, we had issues from the start with buying our tickets n then we used the ATM which was like the only one working took my 60.00 but dispensed nothing. The manager of the games had an attitude and tried to claim it was only my card and it was my problem!? If it wasn't for Diana the manager at the shamu store this experience would have been ruined. Not the nicest employees but a handful are. Do not use atms there! Go to the bank before hand"
1464,3/17/2015,1,"Truly depressing display of animal cruelty. Thoroughly disgusted by the lack of facilities that house such beautiful and enormous orcas. This place should be shut down! I'm saddened that I purchased tickets based on seaworlds propaganda, that will not happen again."
1465,7/1/2013,4,"Not really sure what to say that everyone else already has. It's a fun place to go with the family. There's just about something for everyone. Rides, shows, games, food, drink.Lots of interactive opportunities, and learning, for everyone of all ages."
1466,4/4/2013,3,"I LOVE seaworld! I love marine mammals, I always have. Seaworld has definitely changed. The shamu trainers can't get into the water with the whales (I know why, don't spam me) and the dolphin show seems to be more about the gymnasts and less about the dolphins. Don't get me wrong, the shows are still awesome, but they kind of seemed to lose their focus. Now, if you're going to be there all day, consider the all day dining deal. The best place to get your money's worth is in Calypso's. Pretty good BBQ and the sampler is like $16, not including a drink or side/dessert."
1467,9/6/2012,4,"There are tons of shows, tons of animals, and tons of people! Â I'm sure it would be a little less hectic during the ""off season,"" but we came expecting it to be pretty busy. Â CHECK FOR DEALS! Â We got a AAA deal that allows us to go back to the park again for free before December. Â Awesome! Â SHOWS:Sea Lions LIVE - This show was hilarious. Â It was interactive and very fun. Â Our show did get cut off rather suddenly, which I know can happen if the animals aren't cooperating, but I enjoyed myself nonetheless. Â Blue Horizons - PACKED! Â We had to sit all the way at the very very very very top! Â There was tons of stuff going on during the show and lots to look at. Â I was more interested in seeing the animals, but there was lots of acrobatics in this one as well. Â Pets Rule! - Loved this one. Â So many precious dogs and cats. Â There were a couple kangaroos, pigs, etc. Â This show as so fun to see, even if the animals didn't do what they were supposed to the first time. Â We also saw a Cirque show but I think they closed this one. Â It didn't have any animals at all, and it was just people doing acrobatics. Â Fun, and different. Â RIDES: Journey to Atlantis - Totally different. Â Unexpected. Â I don't want to ruin it, but please go on this one. Â It is a little short, but it's cool. Â And you'll get a little wet!Manta - FUN! Â I enjoyed this ride a lot! Â Lots of twists and turns, and a really cool beginning. Â I don't want to give it away. Â Don't pass this one up. Â Bayside Skyride - A relaxing ride. Â You get some awesome shots of the surrounding areas, and you get the beautiful San Diego weather. Â Wild Arctic Ride - Star Tours meets Arctic. Â Not as cool, and the ride operators were pretty rude. Â If there's a line, pass on this one. Â EXHIBITS:Go see the penguins. Â They're precious, but they smell. Â Be prepared. Â Go see the sea lions. Â They're VOCAL when they want food. Â I know it's pricey, but get some food. Â Some will do some tricks to get your attention because they want your treats!Basically, go to any exhibit you have time for. Â Some might smell, but what do you expect? Â They're wild animals! Be prepared to pay for parking. Â And grab a map, you'll need it!"
1468,12/27/2014,1,"I have been a passholder for 2 years on my current pass and 4 years on my previous pass but we visit easily 3-4 times a month and what earned Seaworld a star for my current review is how much my son loves this place! The first year we owned this pass it went without problem but this past year has been one bad experience after another. In the last 4 months its really seemed to go downhill. It started when my son was injured by an employee at the entrance. It was since resolved by a supervisor however. After that we paid to attend a dine with shamu experience where we were sat in the corner of the spot with a waitress who never seemed to be there. On top of it the ""close up"" interaction was far from it considering a trainer of whale never actually made their way over to the corner we were sitting in. Then as if that wasnt enough, there is almost never anyone at the bay of play toddler mat to monitor the size of the children causing lots of conflict between parents and injuries to smaller children (both of which I have witnessed many many times). This last time i was there 2 weeks ago they switched the time of the ONLY Shamu show which was a Christmas special without updating the app or anyone and when I went to complain about it because it was the only reason we went that day the answer I got was "" yea a lot of people are really upset about that Sorry."" Im sorry too but that doesnt put the gas back in my tank or the time I took out of my day to go there to see it. What finally pushed me overboard was today I called in to get help redeeming my companion pass so that my mom and I could take my son on his second birthday which is today and I was told for the first time since Ive had this pass that it had to be redeemed by the 25th and is no longer valid. When I asked where that was in my contract the supervisor on the phone couldnt answer it and simply said sorry but its expired and there is no guest recovery in place to get it back. Its so unfortunate that I have been such a supporter of seaworld and all that they do even in light of recent bad publicity they have had. I truly do believe they care about the animals I only wish they also cared about the people supporting their work. I have come to the conclusion that my family will not be re-newing our pass because its hard to support a company who I feel has completely let me down and not supported me back. I dont reccomend supporting Sewaworld not because of anything to do with the care of the animals, or the quality of the entertainment but simply because of their lack of support, care, and recovery for their guests."
1469,9/20/2014,1,"Vouchers from work valid for only only 12 days made us go to this place. We were there 10am (business hours 10 -7) and there was a line of 100s of people and it took Â 3 hours just to reach to the counter. We were told your work is not on our list and you can't use these vouchers. Four hour driving and three hours wait in line just to find that those vouchers were just bait to bring you to a point where you will find, "" WE HAVE BEEN CHEATED by #seaworld and now shell $500 to get in. We decided to not to pay $500 and go back home and never go back to any amusement park.Food deal was $32+ for ntire day but it took more than an hour just to get through the line. No Wonder I Have Never Seen Any Decent Person Talking About Amusement Parks, ONLy losers do."
1470,5/13/2015,5,"It doesn't get better than this place right here if you want to relax on a sunny afternoon in San Diego. Some of the nicest people I've met during my stay there, silver pass on that automatic renew!"
1471,11/25/2014,1,We are here now at sea worldWe have never had a problem getting in with our food from home. My family and I have food allergies and need to be careful. I checked with SeaWorld before I bought the tickets because it's a problem I was humiliated and embarrassed coming through the check pointWe have been many times and never had a problem till todayCrapy way to start our family vacation!We had a great trip other than the embarrassing moment going in by the way we still spent 100 dollars on drinks and 30 on other items we have a big family
1472,11/19/2014,5,Every time I come here I had have the great experience even though the park is somewhat small but the shows and animals are incredible to see I will be heading to seaworld for my birthday to also dine with shamu!!!!
1473,12/3/2014,4,"I have been a proud Seaworld pass member for almost 2 years now. I have not regretted my purchase, and have made quite the use of it. I also recently just purchase 3 addition 2 yr passes for my nieces and nephew. For those of you who do not own passes and live in San Diego, especially if you have children, I encourage you to get one. They have low payment plans starting around 7 bucks a month per pass! You get free parking with your pass, that's $15 bucks you're saving on top of everything else each time you visit. Also, with the pass includes a 10 or 15% discount on anything you buy at the park. The shows are pretty awesome. If you're a fan of cirque de soliel, I recommend seeing their cirque de la mer show. It is very entertaining for people of all ages! The aerialists are pretty great. For kids, definitely stop by the Madagascar show. The music is great and kids seem to love it. Heck, you'll find yourself wanting to dance too!!I would've given 5 stars but the food here isn't the greatest. All in all, I recommend visiting and getting a pass :)"
1474,11/1/2014,4,Sea world is a great place for family fun! The year pass is well worth it. Only thing is that not all the employees look like they want to be there. They just need to smile more!
1475,10/30/2014,3,"I can totally how a visit to Sea World is a must, especially if you love fish or sea animals. Â I did not expect to enjoy the shows as much as I did; my favorite was the Blue Horizons dolphin show. Â There were no crowds or lines for any of the shows or rides since we went on a Tuesday. Â I went with the BF and his parents and they enjoyed the different shows, although sitting out in the sun was a little to hot for them. Â All in all, I think this a good attraction, definitely good if you have little kids with you."
1476,12/8/2013,4,"Definitely go during the week if possible, having the empty park was nice and we didn't have to be with crowds of people. I've always enjoyed Seaworld here or in San Antonio. The pet show is pretty awesome. I recommend it. I don't really want to say much to spoil your time. But I recommend the pizza at mamas and the fish and chips at shipwreck. The cable car bay ride was nice and definitely feed the manta rays. We enjoyed our stay. I would go again, just not in the winter time, maybe more spring time."
1477,11/21/2014,4,"fun time. Great place to take the my little guy. I know this place gets scrutinized, but it is a good opportunity to show my son some amazing marine life up close. It was my first time going, it was empty, so that was cool."
1478,7/11/2015,4,Parking and stroller accessibility could improve but overall we love it. While active duty we went once a year. Can't wait to go back
1479,1/4/2011,3,"For the price we paid ($12 for parking and FREE tickets), the SeaWorld was pretty cool. But if I had to pay $70 per person just to get in, I would've been very disappointed.The shows vary in quality but at the very least they are entertaining. Â We saw Shamu-Believe (which one is Shamu anyway?), Sea Lions Live, and Lester's Christmas. Â Believe was filled with corny commentary but I suppose it's supposed to inspire kids? We sat at the top of the wet zone but were lucky enough not to get wet (it was on NYE and it was freezing). Â Sea Lions Live was wacky. Â There was no storyline and while the sea lions were funny (especially Clyde), the little sea otter had no idea what he was doing. Â Lester's Christmas was a pet show and it was hilarious. Â One of the dog trainers in the show was super cute; too bad he didn't have any speaking lines.The longest we waited for an attraction was 45 minutes to see Polar Express 4D. Â The snow effect was fun but the vibrating seats felt kind of odd. Â Those 3D glasses are not made for Asians like me with low nose bridges. Â The Arctic helicopter ride made me so dizzy that I wanted to throw up - not recommended if you have problems with motion sickness.Other than shows and rides, Sea World is filled with ""aquariums."" Â Too bad every one of them looked the same. Â Overall, the facilities just seem really old and outdated. Â A major facelift is necessary or else it'll start looking like the natural history museum.I definitely went to SeaWorld as a kid and I thought it was really fun. Maybe it takes more to impress me now because I'm all grown up."
1480,4/13/2016,3,"Seaworld was okay. Â With the release of the Black fish documentary Seaworld no longer allows human interaction with killer whales during the shows which make the shows boring. Â However, we still had a great way time."
1481,1/3/2011,3,"My mother got me a Silver pass for Christmas... If I had to pay for a membership to Sea World I would simply rather spend my money elsewhere. I have a membership to the SD Zoo, and for a number of reasons would rather spend my time there... I'll name the few. 1. Parking @ the Zoo is free! For everyone, not just Silver memberships.2. Constantly crowded.... You have to wait in line for every exhibit. No so at the Zoo, where you just casually walk at your own pace. 3. The shows all start at the same time... Means you have to stay the entire day to catch more than one. Don't get me wrong, I know a lot of people love Sea World. I am just not a huge fan, but since it's free for the year, you will probably catch me here from time to time..."
1482,8/12/2012,1,"Sea World San Diego is overpriced and unorganized.Yes - the shows are amazing. Yes - the park is clean.Yes - be prepared to wait in lines all day.But the ticket prices are outrageous! Charging a family of 5 close to $500 just to get in for one day is ridiculous. Luckily, a kind passer-by told us they would give us a $15 per person discount if we mentioned the online coupon. We travelled with a disabled person, and everything was difficult for her. It was so sad to see how little support Sea World provide for disabled guests. There were no disabled parking spaces available, so we had to park a very long distance from the entrance. They had sold out of wheelchairs to rent, so our disabled guest had to make do without one. They said they'd put us on a waiting list and call us when one became available, but they never did. That was awful.The Disabled access for the rides (like Manta) is inconvenient and unorganized. The disabled person has to make their way all the way through the gift shop, up ramps, through the crowds, to the exit of the ride, check in with an attendant, and then come back 45 minutes later to ride the ride. Food is another story altogether. Every restaurant was jam packed with people waiting in line. Most places had over an hour wait just to get some food. Eventually, we found a place with a relatively short line (33 minutes) and we spent over $50 on BBQ beef sandwiches. Ugh.Overall, our experience was not a good one. With amazing places like Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm to choose from, we won't be coming back to Sea World."
1483,1/25/2016,3,It's worth visiting this park but don't expect anything grand. The major disappointment was how empty everything seems throughout the park. There's alot of space that should be filled with interesting things related to sealife however this place is completely different from how it used to be during my childhood.
1484,12/5/2014,5,"I have been going to SeaWorld San Diego since I was in grade school. My earliest and one of my most memorable was when one of my friends had a special backstage shark-encounter for his birthday. I got to pet baby sharks! I don't know if they still do that but I know for a fact they still have those encounters for many different species at Sea World, such as the Beluga whales, dolphins, penguins, Â and i think the walrus. The lines are not too unreasonable for an amusement park. If you are coming from out of town and want to see as much as you can, I would recommend spacing out you visit over two days. Not because of lines or availability, but because you could fill your whole visit just watching the shows if you wanted to. I like to just pick my favorite couple attractions, and a couple I had not experienced before too."
1485,3/8/2016,5,"Went to this place a couple times last year. Really good rides, shows, attractions, and food."
1486,4/10/2016,5,"Went to get a smoothie this evening at fusion smoothies. Line was a little bit lengthy, but my day was turned around when I met Jackie who took my drink order. She was very kind and professional. A natural people's person and should be valued as she brought a big smile to my face and made my experience at Sea World that much better. Definitely will be back!"
1487,7/29/2015,3,"My husband & I have been coming to Sea World for 18 years enjoying the time in the beautiful San Diego sun. And we have been even more thrilled to bring our 2 children to experience the same great experience. However, after this visit and all the recent controversy surrounding Sea World it is a shame that you do see a remarkable difference in the attendance. I think Sea World needs to reinvent themselves very quickly. My kids loved the experience but for me I saw the need for Sea World to remodel the park, update ALL the shows and bring out more of the good things they do for the animals such as help rehabilitate, rescue the animals and help the community. If you've never been to Sea World and don't believe all the silly animal activists stories you should go to make up your own opinion. Guarantee you'll have fun and make sure to sit in the splash zone."
1488,8/13/2012,1,"Sea World has changed.... and I will NOT be back any time soon!We invested in one ""all you can dine"" wristband and I am glad that we bought one. Â The food lacks flavor and is served luke warm to cold. The 4 places that you can use the bracelet have food that is basic, the lines are outrageously LONG and there is not much of a selection. Â Around dinner time we decided to have our last meal at the BBQ Smoke house. Â The line was extremely LONG, there was ONE cashier, due to the restaurant closing one side and the food was cold. Â The ribs and brisket was tough and the chicken was dry!!! $32.99 for adults and $16.99 for kids 9 and under... was it worth it.... NO! Bring your own food if you have the time to pack it!All of the other dinning places had fresh food that looked more appetizing and HOT, NO lines... and of course these are the places that we had to pay additional money for because there were not included with our package. Â SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THESE PLACES AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE WRISTBAND!Another disappointment was that the shows are not as entertaining. Â The trainers in the Shamu show do not go in the water, due to the death of the trainer, which I understand. Â However, the show is not even interactive. Â It is VERY staged! It was like watching a DVD with the trainers not really saying too much while using hand and arm motions. It was very hot the day we went, and to be in the hot sun for a show that used to be so much more than what it is.... it was altogether a huge disappointment not to see the same show from previous years. Â Both of my girls, 1 and 4 years old were NOT into the shows at all! As a matter of fact, my 4 year old kept asking me during EACH show.... ""Is it over yet Mommy?"" She was way more interested in going to the Bay of Play and the few rides that were in that area. My 1 year old did not want to sit through the shows because the action was not enough to capture her attention.I am glad we went .... just to say that we did, but Sea World will not be Sea-ing any of our money any time soon!"
1489,8/4/2015,5,"Today our family spent the day at Seaworld. We were fortunate to be able to take the water taxi and not have to wait in lines. Upon entering we got in line at shipwrecked we met an employee who had not quite started her shift. Â She was a GREAT ambassador and was very hospitable. She took our family photo, shared some hot spots of what not to miss. Â During our morning, we bumped into her again and were fortunate to be on another ride with her, she even asked if the other guests would mind changing her seat with them giving up her front seat on the ride. Nicole Buck, you stand out with your kindness and willingness to share your knowledge. We loved learning about all the rides!The shows were fun and the kids really enjoyed it. It was also nice to learn about the care and rescuing of so many animals that Seaworld cares for. We can't wait to visit again!Not sure about the previous comment on the walrus as we saw him and he's huge!"
1490,12/31/2015,4,"Overpriced everything but what do you expect from an amusement park attraction whatever. I liked the shows they put on with the dolphins and sea lions. The food gave me the runs and made me have a stomach ache. Crowded as hell, the food staff looked like they hate their lives. The staff around helping you find where you want to go are cool."
1491,10/11/2014,5,"My daughter is uhhhhhbsessed with Elmo at the present moment so I decided to take her to see him at Sea World for her 2nd bday. Â I am so happy we took her because she had such a blast!! It was a weekday so there were no long lines, and we got to explore every nook of that park! Â I was bummed about missing the Madagascar show, they weren't showing it that particular day, but we watched the whale show of course, some animal (dogs/cats/birds) trick show, and the dolphin show. Â Everything was so neat & we loved feeding the sea otters & eels. Â My favorite was probably the penguin area & the sharks... They literally have a Store at every single exit of the attraction you just visited, so watch out! Â I had a great time, I'll be back in the future!"
1492,4/2/2015,4,"As we live in San Diego, we are members of Sea World. Â We are also fans! Â Although the food and gift shops are expensive as well as parking (I park for free with our pass) it is a great park to visit all day or just a couple of hours with the kids.After watching Blackfish I was concerned about the larger animals at Sea World, however after speaking with my Sister-in-law (who was the trainer in the movie Blackfish that was pulled into the water and her arm was broken) I believe the current Sea World has reviewed and improved their safety measures and truly cares for their animals. Â Highly recommend this park, we always have a great time."
1493,9/20/2014,1,What a miserable experience waiting for 2 hours just to buy a ticket to get in. I'm very discouraged so far. Not looking forward to coming back :(
1494,9/11/2016,1,It's free plush toys month at Seaworld for pass holders. Different one each week. Just received the mailer this week and we're here at the park and were told they ran out of this week's shark last Wed. Next weeks toy available tomorrow. NOT GOOD GOR THOSE OF US ATTENDING THIS WEEKEND!!!! A note on your website would have been appreciated.
1495,11/28/2016,5,My daughter loves coming to Sea World! Even when there are a lot of people at the park it doesn't feel as busy because there is SO much to do! All of the shows are the perfect length and are very entertaining!
1496,4/11/2013,4,"Fun times at Sea World. We took advantage of the ""Fun Pass."" Buy the pass for one day and trade it in for an entire years worth of Sea World fun. We decided to be smart about it and do one day of rides. We were prepared with a backpack full of dry clothes and a towel. On this particular day it was cold, windy and overcast. Fortunate for us that meant no lines and we could ride the line as many times as we wanted. We enjoyed the shipwreck theme all throughout the ride. My favorite part was that Â bystanders can use a water gun (machine took quarters) and soak the riders. We were soaked after 3 kids decided to aim and soak us. Only 4 stars because if you weren't prepared like we were you end up spending $5 for a ""body air dryer."" Or even more money buying dry clothes. But what are theme parks for if they didn't rob you of all your money."
1497,6/30/2014,1,"If I could give it zero stars I would. First off I only came here because I work in hospitality and was given tickets. Secondly it's not even worth it because the shows are lame and besides the fact that these glorious creatures are not supposed to be in little tanks. It is inhumane that these beautiful animals are in these literally tiny tanks. They are taken from all around the world, Traded from park to park. But another thing is the locker situation is a rip off!! $2.00 an hour is ridiculous. Food is expensive and not even good. It used to be $3.00 a day. Plus there's no interaction with the exception of the sea lion show. That was the only good thing because it was full of good music and the presentation was great. Ship wreck rapids line was a 2 hour wait time when the rafts go by only half of them actually had ppl in them. This is ridiculous in itself. The people who work here are rude and don't know anything about the park. We had a simple question ""does this gate open for the shamu show?"" Idk let me get an answer for you. Half an hour later he never came back. Just cold service all around. If you are going to work in hospitality you had better have a smile on your face and a kick to your step. This place is ridiculously over priced and not worth it. Plus the animals are in cages and after seeing blackfish I will never go again. #FreeShamu"
1498,12/30/2010,4,"Pretty unbelievable I haven't written a review for this especially since we paid for a yearly pass two years in a row. Â We've since let our yearly pass lapse and haven't been to Sea World in over a year, but in the two years we had the pass we probably went at least 4x a year (if not more). Â If I was paying for general admission, I wouldn't rate this park above a 3 due to the price. Â However, the yearly pass is a great deal especially if you have young children. Â If you pay for the premium pass, the parking costs get thrown in as well. Â These are significant so keep that in mind. Â  While we were going, Sea World was my son's favorite place to visit (well he asked for the zoo a lot too) especially after they built the new kiddie play area complete with rides geared for younger children and a really cool climbing area. Â He could spend hours there. Â For the rest of the family, the usual exhibits are pretty fun and well done and there are always the dolphin and whale shows. Â I've never been on the big kid rides so can't comment on those (but they look fun!). For the adults, they used to have free beer tasting (awesome!). Â But I've heard this is defunct now. Â The Clydesdales may be too, but since I haven't been to Sea World in so long, I have no idea. Â I know a lot of people have complained about the food here, but we've always found it to be decent for park food. Â What do you expect from park food anyways? In any case, I think it's better food than the Zoo. All in all, worthwhile if you have kids and get the yearly pass. Â Not so much otherwise."
1499,3/31/2016,2,"I was really underwhelmed, especially at $80 a person! The Orca/Shamu show was a big let-down. Cheesy music and zero information about the whales, their behaviors, the training, their ages, names etc. Kind of insulting to the audience. A missed opportunity to educate. The rest of the exhibits we have at our local zoo."
1500,12/22/2016,3,"Took my 3 kids there, it was a rainy day so that played in partly to the lower rating, 2 of the 3 could ride everything, the big kid rides were ok, liked Atlantis n Mantas, really disappointed with Wild Arctic... not a lot rides for my 4 year old, the sesame area was ok.... the shows, shamu was ok, really liked the seal show. The rain kinda made everyone cold n cranky, so we didn't see as much as we would have liked too, kinda spendy maybe alittle overrated."
1501,4/25/2014,5,Highlight touching a bamboo shark! Free to military!Loved feeding and interacting with the animals plus great exhibits. Â Would definitely recommend. Â Oh also awesome rides and great food at the little cafe.
1502,8/5/2015,5,"My boys each did a week at Sea World camp and boy did they have a great time! The only down side for me was while having a second grader and a kindergardener, the kinder class is only offered for a half day camp and there is no option for after care until the older child's camp is done at 3. But, every day they had tons of information they wanted to share with me and they made fun crafts that they have used to decorate their rooms with. The counselors were all very nice and good at communicating with me throughout the week as to upcoming activities and such. Fun times!"
1503,10/20/2013,4,"Super fun.... For the littles, check out the pet show and the Sesame Street area.... Parking is a little steep ($15/$20), but all in all, a great place to spend the day. Get a year pass!"
1504,12/29/2015,3,"I loved this place as a kid, although I've heard they have gone down hill in recent years. Worth the trip, but have your credit cards and or cash on hand. Great attractions. I'd recommend them for some family fun."
1505,10/4/2014,1,"Let the whales go!!! They do not belong in that tiny tank!!!! I've been to sea world and it's so boring and the animals look so sad. Such a waste of money, plus the people that work there are absolutely so rude."
1506,10/16/2013,3,"Surprisingly, the cirque show as very entertaining. Â All else, wasn't that impressed with seaworld."
1507,7/25/2012,4,"I have been wanting to get a Sea World annual pass for the last 4 years but for some reason I always felt that it was so expensive! However, on the SD Fair I was offered 2 tickets to sea world to listen to some stupid time share presentation. After 1.5 hours of my time they said no sea world tickets but gave me $150 American express card. SCORE! You can get a silver membership at Costco for only $100/personThe silver pass not only pays for parking which is normally $13 or $14, but also allows you to go into the park one hour early! This allows you to ride Manta the new ride multiple times and the nice thing is you don't have to exit and run back in line. They actually let you just cut through! Lockers are available since you can't bring any bags onto the ride. Lockers are free the first hour of the day! The Shamu show is very different from before since the trainers can't go into the water. It's still pretty decent. Who would have thought you can train a killer whale to do flips and splash people. They also have a variety of other shows, including the dolphin show, a seasame street dance show (you can get take pics with Big Bird, Elmo, Cookie Monster etc), sea lion show, and also a crique del soleil show. I loved the turtle reef exhibit and they even have a tortoise on the grass area for people to put and take pics with! Don't forget about the fireworks every night at 9:50pm. If you are going to spend the whole day it's worth it to get the AYCE pass. For $32.99 (10% off with silver membership). We decided to eat to our hearts content and probably spent half the time eating. Â You can choose from 4 different restaurants: bbq one, italian, sandwiches, and a variety place which has burgers, salmon, fried food. It also includes drinks so you don't need to carry around your water. You also get dessert and sides with each meal. I love JELLO!! They also have true mo chocolate milk but be careful if you are lactose intolerant because it's 1% and I found out the hard way... Come back again? Duh! I have the annual pass now"
1508,6/26/2013,4,"If money is no object, then this is really a pretty damn good experience. Unfortunately, money does matter for most of us and this park is EXPENSIVE all the way around. If you escape dropping less than $100/person after parking, merch, and food, consider yourself blessed. But lots of good shows. All of them high quality. Only complaint is echoing what some other reviewers are saying: they COULD decrease the Cirque Del Soleil aspects of the shows and increase the actual animal time. After all, that's what we're here to see right?"
1509,5/29/2015,1,I went to seaworld as part of a dance trip and i didn't know much about it before i went. It was horrible. I saw this polar bear sitting in a small enclosure by himself just sitting and staring miserably at a fish in the water. It just sat there the whole time. I felt so guilty being there and seeing all the animals in little pools instead of being in their home - the beautiful ocean. I wish i would have been outside with the protestors.
1510,8/12/2015,4,"I love sea world we went there last Wednesday with my cousins and there parents and mine as well we heard over the intercom 10 minutes till closing shortly after that all of a sudden fireworks went off, now both my parents are former marines now my mom was ok but my dad has PTSD and when that firework came off with no warning he jumped. I think they need to think about are veterans more thanks for letting us in for free but maybe a warning with the fireworks would be a good idea, we do live in SD home of the military"
1511,6/17/2012,4,"A Short&Sweet Review..... Shorter than most reviews and sweeter than a quick tip.SHORT (not so great....)1. One Ocean, the Shamu Show, was sort of a disappointment. None of the trainers were in the water or jumping off the killer whales. I guess the death of a trainer by a killer whale really made them increase the safety precaution. Â 2. The shark exhibit was just okay... Too dark to see from the top down. 3. Did not ride Manta:(Sweet! (the good...)1. Blue Oceans - it was the most entertaining show at Sea World. They combined cirque, dolphins, and birds and meshed them all in a twenty something minutes show.2. There are couple petting zoos... Starfishes and manta rays. Â Interesting and different. Â My bro was able to test out his GoPro camera here, which was entertaining.3. Â Per my mom, she thinks the layoff performers from Vegas found a job at Sea World. Â Every other show has some sort of cirque element to it."
1512,7/25/2015,4,"Circ del la Mer is AMAZING, it is a must see in my opinion. The acrobatics are incredible. The otter and sea lion show is also a must if you are looking for a funny and clever show to relax after rides and petting the manta rays. I would highly recommend some towels for the Shamu Show ahah! My only disapproval is that the stands did not have any cheese for their pretzels!"
1513,8/21/2014,1,this was my trip to sea world san diego after waiting 11 years. I had purchased the beluga whale experience for my husband as a surprise. Â it was not worth the $215 Â for this experience. Â the staff is very unfriendly and the shows were very disappointing. Â everything in the park is overpriced including the parking. Â  most all of the attractions end in the souveniers shops so be prepared to drop major cash. Â a lot of the stands thru out the park were closed so walking distance to find a drink or water was not easy and the cirque show was closed.
1514,8/2/2015,4,"Had a great time and will be back. Seaworld staff reacts with pleasure and attractions are very entertaining. Manta ride is exhilarating. Awesome place for everyone. My child who loves animals, had a wonderful experience and that is what matters most."
1515,2/4/2011,4,"SEA WORLD, SEA WORLD, SEA WORLD.....I came here a lot of times during summer because I bought the summer pass! Â Recently, I came here with my psi friends for back stage tour. Â It was fun! Â I saw a lot of dolphin and shamu! Â Just go! Â You will love this place for sure!-1 star, I heard the annual pass is the same price as one day pass! Â I think it's unfair for tourists!"
1516,7/7/2015,5,Crowds are manageable. Always a great time! I would suggest going right when then open or between 5-6 to get prime parking and be able to avoid the big crowds.
1517,7/23/2014,1,"We took our family on Monday 7/21/14. My husband and I both arranged to take off work and come to Sea World for our 3 kids to enjoy. My past memory of Sea World was very good, and our last visit was about 10 yrs. ago. We were expecting to have a similar experience.  Â  Â  Boy how things have changed. Similar to some of the reviews I have been reading- we had so many of the same experiences, and it looks like Sea World's management responds the same way. Everything seems not taken care of, or clean. The park smells of dirty water- especially evident in the pools where all the kids and people touch the animals; the water was disgusting. In one of the bird exhibits outside the penguin area, the bird poop water was just disgusting and smelled terrible. Â  The worst part was walking into the restrooms. The restrooms had terrible ventilation and felt about 95 degrees inside. They were hot, smelly and dirty. They felt comparable to campground restrooms. There are also not a lot of restrooms easily accessible by the different areas of the park- you have to walk to a different area just to use the restrooms. When buying over priced snacks the ""self serve"" area was out of napkins (which my kids need when eating messy things like the overpriced churros we bought). Â When we needed to (because of the heat) buy Icees, they were out of the cups and had no lids! The park did not seem clean like it was the last time I was there, and the overall quality has gone down a lot. Â  Â  The signage really needs upgrading. In order to go to walk into some exhibits, it is difficult to find where to walk into. And the gift shops at the end of every single exhibit was a nightmare and overpriced. In all, it was an overpriced expensive waste of gas money, and waste of a day off of work. Â Anywhere you went it was overcrowded, and there was no shade to sit in, in any area of the park. During summer this is extremely necessary to have shady spots to sit and eat, regroup, etc. Â It was also a disaster to wait in line for 45 min. - 1 hr. for a 15 min show. With no shade to sit in. Another complaint even my young daughter noticed is that the tanks for the animals are too small for their size. It is sad to look at the animals, as they seem hot, uncomfortable, and not treated very well. We wont go back...ever."
1518,2/9/2015,4,"I was hesitant to pay a hundred bucks a person but it was worth it, actually surpassed my expectations. I thought the shows were cool, a little heavy on the thematic elements and a little light on the animals preforming, but still cool. Very impressive they taught Dolphins, Sea lions, and Whales to entertain us. The interactive exhibits were amazing. Atlantis was closed but we didn't care. We didn't do anything that got us wet including the other river ride that does. We did do the rollercoaster and every other thing we could and spent the full seven hours the park was open. My favorite exhibit was the turtles for sure. A great day, way better food the San Diego Zoo, but still average."
1519,12/20/2014,5,"Thank you Seaworld for your commitment to sea creatures. Your sea rescue team is above and beyond. I was also at your park yesterday and really enjoyed ""pets house"". Glad to see that the dogs, cats, pigs, kangaroos, and birds are all positively re enforced. Working with service dogs myself I can see they really have fun. I know you are a business and care a lot about revenue but you guys fund many different sections of sea rescue and animal rescue shelters that you don't have to. Please shrug off PETA and keep doing what your doing. Their hearts are in the right place but they over due it a bit."
1520,9/6/2015,2,"I just have to complain about the poor management of the rides. For example in the shipwreck ride there are 9 seats to one boat, and at times they are only filling it with three people. There are a lot of people waiting and it just makes no sence. I have children that want to see and learn about the sea animals and how are they going to do that when they don't even try to move the rides along faster."
1521,6/17/2015,4,"All in all I had a great experience at sea world today. I have. I have not been since I was 15 years old and that's almost seven years ago. They have added a lot more rides and fun activities to do. I took my friend from out of town that has never been and she also had a blast. Minus one star because a photo booth attraction ate a $20 bill from me and did not return our change :( other than that, it was a blast! Fun for all ages, always"
1522,10/6/2014,5,I love this place we have a whole bunch of fun we got a year pass and went almost every Sunday after church to sea world it was fun.
1523,11/6/2014,5,"Pricing: Expensive. But there are a lot of awesome shows.Quality: Good-Excellent. The shows were mostly good entertainment, but the highlight was the close encounters!Turnaround: Excellent. We came on a weekend and had no line issues whatsoever.Service: Good-Excellent. I am so glad they let us bring our own food.There are some awesome deals online and for the summer season, but overall, the tickets are very expensive. However compared to Disneyland and Universal Studios, SeaWorld is the best deal. The shows are not top-notch quality, but they are super entertaining and well worth the visit for all of them with their own themes and everything. I enjoyed the seal and otter show best with all the parodies on current TV shows. Unfortunately we did not make it in time for the Madagascar show, which my father was looking forward to, but I am sure that there are more opportunities in the future. I enjoyed all the different aquariums and the close encounters with the sharks, manta rays, and fish were the best part. Though I did feel conflicted about the whole captivity thing. Someday I hope to enjoy an aquarium out at sea and watch animals in the wild. We had no problems with lines that day so kudos to that! We walked to the front of the park and next thing I know, we were already inside. We stayed late enough for the fireworks so more bang for our buck, pun intended. I am not sure if this count as service, but I was surprised that they let us bring our own food into the park given that a lot of places now forces you to eat the overpriced food that is sold in the park so thank you SeaWorld for not being such a douche! Moreover, I left my water bottle at the game booths area and found it still there with an employee safekeeping it just as I ran back into the park before closing."
1524,7/18/2012,5,"SeaWorld is one of the best attractions in California ... if not the best ... It was on the top of my list to visit when I came to California for the first time. I can't describe my feelings when I entered SeaWorld, after all the days I wished to be there in my life.... There are so many things to describe ... so beautiful things that I don't think a review would be enough to tell about ... the most wonderful thing is when you see people happy with memories that would last with them forever"
1525,6/28/2012,2,"This place is so incredibly over-rated. I mean, Jesus. My friend got free tickets through his work, so luckily I didn't waste money. But had I paid the ridiculous price of $73 to get in, I would have been pissed! Sea World is pretty cheap as far as what they offer. First of all, they have paper straws and no lids for their beverages. I mean, how cheap is that? They also don't post signs very well that inform guests where the attractions are. The shows were tacky and stupid (with the exception of one of them, which I will get to later). Â The seal show was tacky and dumb and full of corny jokes that were not funny unless you are Mormon. The Killer Whale show was a waste of time. The trainers didn't even interact in the water with the whales, and all they did was swim in circles and jump. I mean, that was only entertaining for 30 seconds. The Manta ride was closed, and they didn't even post this. Guess they wanted as much money as they could and didn't mind misleading guests. There are so few rides in this park that the lines are MASSIVE. The Atlantis line was 90 minutes long. And the ride itself was ""meh"". Parking was $14. Stupid. Rip off. Food is over-prices too. I was smart and brought my own food in, but my buddy didn't and spent $10 on fish and chips. Or in other words, 2 small fish sticks and about 10 individual fries. I kid you not. So, I must say I loved looking at the penguins and sharks. Also, turtle reef was nice. But the BEST thing about Sea World has NOTHING to do with marine life: The Pet Show. About 30 dogs and cats performed on stage doing tricks and such. It was CUTE CUTE CUTE. Oh, one of the orcas has a bent dorsal fin from being in their captivity for over 4o years. These animals needs a larger space in order for them to stay healthy. I felt bad looking at them. I will not be coming back."
1526,8/12/2012,2,"Coming from San Antonio, which houses the largest SeaWorld park, I admit that I arrived at SeaWorld San Diego with certain expectations, but even having gone to city aquariums and amusement parks over the years, I think that I have a credible base for comparison.What irked me the most about SeaWorld San Diego seemed to be the lack of organization. Â How difficult would it be to post or have markers for wait times? Â SeaWorld should take a page from the Disney and Universal parks nearby, which all have posted wait times as well as phone apps. that patrons can access for approximate wait times. Â For rides like Manta, Atlantis, and even the skyride and skytower, lines outstretched the designated wait areas. Ultimately, wait times for rides were never worth the actual experience of the ride. Â I would recommend going to the skytower, however, because once inside, you get an aerial view and a sense of the layout of the park beyond the map. Â It's also a nice break from walking, and you get to sit in an air conditioned area while you take in the view.The park is small and features few rides. Â In addition, being a family oriented park, the rides are more geared toward children and young teens, so don't expect any thrill rides here. Â For the price of admission and parking, it really isn't worth a visit unless you have an annual pass. Â If the park had a water park included, as SeaWorld San Antonio does, then maybe the cost would be worth it, but as is, I would recommend simply visiting Mission Bay Park or the San Diego Zoo for your water and/or animal fix.Side notes: The Journey to Atlantis ride will get you wet. Â If you do not want wet clothes or shoes, then they offer ponchos available for purchase. Â You cannot take backpacks or large bags to Manta. Â You will be required to place your bag in a locker or leave it with someone in your party who will not be riding."
1527,5/29/2012,3,"Its no longer my Sea World :(SW has always had a warm spot in my heart for many reasons. It was always a fun place to visit and learn about marine life. It was a place were pretty much any college age person looking to make an extra buck over the summer could get a job easily ( just like I did Â ;-) ). Well thats the past and we dont live there anymore.SW has become this dollar obsessed marketing machine that now relies on gimmicky items such as roller coasters, carnival themed games and all sorts of other motion rides to justify its out of control price of admission.But I suppose the best way for me to review the overall experience of the visit will be to put it down in the all too popular bullet point ""pro & con"" review. So here it goes:THE PROS:* For a three day weekend it wasnt very crowded.* If you dont mind getting to a show a 1/2 hour early you'll get a decent seat.* The food is better than whats served up at most other So Cal theme parks, yes that included Disneyland. There's tons of options to choose from.* If marine life education is not your things, there is plenty of pricy beer and ride distractions to choose from and stare at.* The Sky Tower that use to cost $ to ride on is now free!* Sea World LOOOOOOVES the military so much that they will treat you like royalty (and thats alright). * If you live in SD or LA its kinda worth getting the extended pass. It doesnt cost extra but it does come with tons of black out dates. So thanks for that SW.* The firework show still kicks ass!THE CONS:* Way too many rides have removed or compromised many of the animal exhibits. For example, the Manta roller coaster zooms over the existing manta ray pond, and I'm sure that cant be good for them.* SW is now no better than those places over seas where you can jump in and interact with dolphins. For a small premium you can suit up and get in the water with these creatures and ""interact"". I think this is now blatant exploitation. * The fish exhibits that still remain are in bad need of maintenance and updating.* People & trainers aren't allowed to interact with Shamu anymore. And the Walrus that spits water filled with feces on people has been removed from the seal show. Hmm maybe thats a pro?* Mama Stella's has a long ass line. Really?* You'll be broke by lunch time. Oh wellIm sure Ill be updating this review over time. Ill be returning to cash in on our year fun pass. So until then Ill leave you with this:At the Dolphin lagoon the guide was claiming that SW feeds all their animals up to 40k pounds daily of fish and squid. Maybe if you had like 4 orca's instead of 8 to feed, you could save a bit and lower the price. Im just sayn'. Stay classy Sea World San Diego."
1528,8/13/2012,1,"Disappointing. Â I so agree with the other reviewers who said ""What happened? Â Sea World used to be so much better."". Â I've been to several different Sea Worlds but this is the only one where I was disappointed and really felt it was not worth the money. Â Parking is $15.00. Â A regular day ticket is $73.00. Â How do families afford that? Â The Shamu show was just ok. Â I liked the dolphin show but my son said there was too much human entertainment and not enough animal entertainment. Â The next day we went to the San Diego Zoo and that was so much better than Sea World. Â If you've been to Sea World once, I don't recommend going to this Sea World."
1529,7/16/2012,4,"To be clear, this is not a review of Sea World, but a review of the All Day Dining option they offer. Putting all moral opinions aside about how these animals are procured (See the documentary The Cove if you don't follow me), if you have kids, you will probably end up there at one time or another. After spending a fortune getting inside the park, I definitely suggest taking advantage of their All Day Dining option. Unless you bring a giant bag of burritos from home (something my Mother in law does on trips like this), you are going to have to buy food at the park. At 30 bucks for adults and 15 for kids- you can't beat this option. In fact, if you plan on eating more than once at the park, this is a no brainer.After paying, either inside the park at a kiosk or when you purchase your tickets, you are given a wrist band to wear for the entirety of the day. You are limited to four restaurant options, one that serves breakfast. At each location you can get one side or dessert, one entree and one non-alcoholic beverage. Go about your day and eat anytime you feel like it- as many times as you want. Get something you don't like, simply go get something else. Want milk with your giant slice of cake, but already have a beverage- get back in line and get more. The only downside is that because you are limited to four restaurants, the peak eating times are crazy. If you don't wan't to wait an hour for food, eat breakfast early, lunch late, and dinner either very early or late. Stick to these tips, and the option is more than worth it. Just don't order the fish and chips at Sea World- it's just disturbing."
1530,8/16/2015,4,Very fun place but sad to see so many great mammals in captivity. They perform for food. What is sad they will never survive in a wild because they are used to be fed
1531,1/19/2015,3,"I went to Sea World over Christmas break and generally had a favorable experience. It was fun to see the dolphin show, the sea lion show and Shamu. There were also fun rides amusement park games and plenty of fun exhibits to see. Also at the same time it was sad to see the exhibits that the animals were in, especially the polar bear exhibit. It seemed so harsh and small compared to the exhibit at the San Diego Zoo where the polar bears can run around on actual grass and dirt. Â Sea world is definitely fun for kids and is an excellent way to see some very amazing animals. I also really liked their snow exhibit where you can play in the snow and throw snowballs at targets. Â In the end though I somehow walked away feeling sad for the animals which is something I didn't feel at the San Diego Zoo and Safari Park."
1532,2/28/2015,1,"First, I got there and had purchased a pass from smart destinations. It said to go to a window which was not open so I asked the people who were at/in front of front gate to help. They did not know what to tell me to do so they sent me to another lady who said I would need to stand in the ticket line! It was a mile long and the whole point of buying tickets beforehand was to avoid the line but I did as I was told. While standing in line for 35+ minutes I called the company from which I bought the passes and they said I shouldn't have been told that and I could've went to entrance and gotten in. I was pretty close to the front by this time so I figured I'd just stay put. When I got to the front the ticket person said I could have went to gate and gotten in. I told her the people who were there to assist needed to be re-educated then because they did not know. Once inside, a lot of things were closed and it was just kind of sad. I have never been here and was looking forward to it, we had a good day and I enjoyed the shows. We did dine with shamu which was neat as you got to see him up close. The food was just alright but I wasn't expecting gourmet. Overall it was just ok and I won't be rushing back."
1533,6/4/2014,1,"Point blank... I will never return here and I will never take my future children here. This place is far from magical or exciting. First off the whole premise of this place is wretched, but I'll save that for a different post. The Shamu show was ridiculous, not worth the whales freedom, and far from entertaining. The whole place is run down and old. The penguin exhibit smelled so horribly, the shark exhibit was dirty and dusty. Â If you are looking to see beautiful sea life please look for other options, whale watching for example. Seaworld is extremely overpriced and is basically a dirty circus show that revolves around forcing wild animals to perform mildly entertaining tricks, and keeping them in cages that are FAR too small, but I'm willing to bet most of you already knew that. Horrible place."
1534,8/22/2012,5,"Well everyone we just got back from vacation and I have a ton of reviews I have to leave! Â I'm going to start backwards from the last place we visited and work my way through our journeys!I usually take the last week in June for vacation but this year my brother and sister decided we were going to take the whole family (mine, my brother and my sister) and all our kids on a trip around California. Â Yup the whole group! Â Sounds like fun right? Â Well, it can be but by the end of our trip everyone was getting a little restless wanting to see their friends, even the adults I think were ready to get away from each other but we just had a blast! Â  Of course all of us only had so much time before we had to get back to school jobs etc., so we decided to take the kids to some fun spots they have never been to around the California area.We decided we would visit an attraction and either stay with family or friends that we knew in each of the areas we visited or we chipped in for a cheep hotel, making the trips as affordable as we could. Â A good thing so we could spend more time on the activities. Â Our last stop was Sea World in San Diego. Â Now yes, we have been there many times before, so this wasn't anything new, but it was a huge request coming from all the kids so we had to include it? Â How could you not?!One of my dear friends lives in San Diego so the whole group stayed with her for a few days and she and her family accompanied us to Sea World.I have to tell you the price to get into Sea World is outrageous compared to other parks. Â Even with the group we had, and package we paid for to get into other theme parks as part of the deal, it was costly but totally worth it. Â The length of stay is also something that should be discussed so other employees understand what they are selling but that is another story!There is so much to do in one little park it's quite difficult to figure out what you want to do. Â The night before my brother and sister planned out the events we would see so we had a good idea of what we were going to be doing making sure we got to everything the kids wanted to see as well as see some of the animal shows.One event that the kids absolutely loved is that they were able to eat with Shamu. Â My sister who is afraid of whales waited outside while we were at the dinner but it was soo very cool! Â No the kids didn't get in the water with him; they just sat in the stands while he swam around in the water. Â Could we have seen the park without this, yes of course, why pay more when you already paid enough to get into the park but this we thought was a once in a lifetime thing so why not. Â Went over very well with everyone except my sister.They have plenty of cool shows for everyone's liking. Â My sister and I love the water shows, and most of the time my sister and I were saying ""wow, how on earth did they do that"". Â Sort of what we felt like watching the Olympics.My brother's kids and my younger daugher Megan just loved the sea lions show so much he wanted to watch it again at the next showing. Â It was my other daughter's fault he heard they had another show so I offered to stay and watch it with them as my brother is a stickler for sticking to schedules so you can't mess with the schedule! Â Fireworks are always a great way to end a perfect day so we watched as they lit off some really beautiful and colorful ones. Â I could go on and on about our day but all in all everyone had a wonderful time and the kids are already talking about what they want to see next year, if we go next year that is! Â I suggest getting a package deal, going early in the day and maybe finding a picnic area where the kids can rest for a while, wear comfortable shoes and clothes, be prepared to get wet because it just might happen, bring little snacks the kids can eat so you are not paying a lot for food all day (of course they have the all day dining deal but just trying to help you save some money), bring your own stroller if you have little ones, don't pay to rent one when you have one already (!), bring water bottles so the kids have something to drink if they get hot, wear light clothing if it's a hot day, if you go with a group wear the same colors so the kids can easily spot you if they wander off, and ending the day in the gift shop is a good idea because the kids are too tired to tell you everything they want."
1535,3/16/2015,4,Love this place. I got a free teachers pass and a free ticket for my hubby. Great job sea world! I would have liked if we could have purchased a parking pass though. On a busy Sunday the up front parking for $21 is a must. I am still waiting for the Madagascar show to reopen. Love the parent swap idea. One waits in line. Then the other gets to bypass line and go straight to the front
1536,9/5/2012,4,"And they say Disneyland is the best place on Earth. Foolish preposterous people! I scowl at their banal existence. Have they not visited SeaWorld yet? Me thinks so.I visited SeaWorld with having the lowest or just not having any expectations whatsoever. All I ever knew about SeaWorld was one thing: Shamu. My initial perception about SeaWorld was that they have a Shamu, who lives in a huge tank, probably does backflips, splashes its audience with water once in awhile and then gets fed loads of fish to get praised for its trivial backflips. I mean really, if I wanted to watch a Shamu do backflips all day I can just pop in my Free Willy VHS and probably get the same satisfaction right?Much to my surprise, the whale show at Shamu Stadium reigned supreme to any lion jumping through a fiery ring type of show or even the backflips that Free Willy did himself. I truly expected to watch a pitiful show that consisted of obnoxious barking sea lions, followed by annoying barking dolphins and ended with a 10 minute segment of Shamu doing five backflips in a row and then ending the show with yet another backflip. But my dear friends, the whale show was strictly Shamu. No barking sea lions or dolphins. You got not just one Shamu, but four Shamus. I repeat, FOUR SHAMUS! My mind was blown. Fourfold. I laughed, I cried, I knee slapped to the point my hands and right knee went numb. Either the show was absolutely sensational or I am a simple minded woman. I was impressed with how intelligent each Shamu was. There was one particular segment that I thoroughly enjoyed where the trainer and Shamu Number One had a synchronized dance portion. It was absolutely adorable as they waltzed right next to each other simultaneously. Then as the dance segment ended, Shamu Number Two, Three and Four suddenly jumped out of the water in complete synchrony and dove right back into the water with such perfection as pyrotechnics blew from the stage. The Shamus would then relocate to their designated end of their tank and once again in synchrony splash the audience with the end of their tails. Then they would each show off their individual talent: backflip, backwards float, tail wave, etc. Just when I thought all amazingness was over, Shamu Number Four would kill the audience with cuteness as it would jump onto the dry platform and show the world its shiny white belly. Then when the trainer would ask Shamu Number Four if he'd like more fish, he would nod yes until fed. I don't even know how I was able to fathom such cuteness. Eek! I'm going to go hug a dozen baby kittens and barf rainbows just to dissipate the cuteness overload I'm feeling.Yes I was entirely impressed with the Shamus, but I was also impressed with the entire venue. There were only two disappointments to my visit: the turkey leg taking a bajillion minutes to be prepared and then resulting in not being delicious and the octopus exhibit at Aquarium de la Mer being renovated and closed (not to mention the silly worker who promised the exhibit was open. LIAR!) But I forgive because each exhibit kept me on my toes. The Wild Arctic exhibit was phenomenal; the penguin, polar bear, walrus, baby beluga displays couldn't be any better minus the polar bear looking rather lonely. But the entire area for the Arctic Wild definitely made me feel as if I was trekking through the barren snow covered grounds of Antartica. And to add onto any needed brownie points, I must mention I saw baby beluga penis. WHOA! Mind blown. We also stopped by the Shark Encounter, Turtle Reef, Aquarium de la Mer, flamingos, fed a couple of bat rays... Jesus. I mean honestly? If you still don't believe SeaWorld is a million times better than Disneyland let me leave you with these questions. Can you feed a bunch of bat rays while simultaneously petting them with your bare hands at Disneyland? Can you refeed the bat rays with the fish that they just regurgitated and go home with your entire right arm smelling like the Pacific Ocean at Disneyland? Can you win a giant stuffed Shamu in the game area at Disneyland? Can you scare a bunch of flamingos with the giant stuffed Shamu that you just won at Disneyland? Can you hold a sea star with your bare hands and forcefully toss it back into the tide pool so that it's facing the wrong side at Disneyland? Can you watch a bunch of shark embryos wriggle within an aquarium at Disneyland? Can you drink a couple beers and procede to surpass a bunch of smelly kids at the penguin exhibit at Disneyland? Can you simultaneously get splashed by Shamu while watching the most amazing whale show at Disneyland? Does Disneyland even have a whale show? And most importantly... does Disneyland even allow baby beluga penis to be exposed? I believe not, therefore my theory as to why SeaWorld is the best place on earth has been vindicated. You can sit down now Mickey Mouse because Shamu rules the world."
1537,6/28/2011,5,"Sea World started my life long obsession with aquatic creatures and biology in general. Thanks to them, I currently have 3 aquariums at home. Back in the day, they had a pagoda-like building full of commerson dolphins, a play ground area called Shamu's Happy Harbor and the penguin encounter looked good. Those were the days....Recently, they bulldozed the Forbidden Reef petting area and are going to build a roller coaster on the site. Sea World is still great but it seems like they are doing away with the animal attractions and going the Six Flags route."
1538,5/28/2012,4,"Sea World tries. They do a tremendous of good for marine stranded and hurt marine animals. I respect them for that. The park is beautifully landscaped and well maintained. They offer a few deals....for instance, all you can eat...all day dining passes for $30. Unfortunately, most of their food items are less than palatable. Even my seven year old couldn't stomach their greasy macaroni and cheese or their dried out and over sugared chocolate cake.Getting into the park is no joy. They rifle through your bags as though you may be smuggling in dynamite. Seriously absurd. These people are inept. Any actual terrorist could simply strap their weopons to the bottom of a wagon or stroller and cheerfully cruise right past them. The goofs working their gates behave as though you're trying to gain entry into Fort Knox....but have no idea what to look for.Save your money. DO NOT pay extra for a front of line pass. The pass is so worthless it would be laughable...if they didn't rock you and extra $25 for it. Â AFTER you've paid for it and it's been printed out...they inform you it is only good on their four oldest rides. Rides with little to no line most of the time anyway.Now for a brief discussion about their overly hyped and heralded Manta ride. Oh lord. How do I put this in a kind way? The line is a long one. Worse.....once you wait about a half hour in this line they have larger people try to sit in their demo seats. How humiliating for the ones who are then forbidden to ride. Even worse...they then force everyone with a hat, or a purse or backpack, etc...to leave the line and secure their items in a locker prior to getting back in line to ride. You get to wait in yet another line for a locker and then you have to hope their line bouncers recognize you so you can find a place at their half way point rather than be sent back to the end of the line.At the front of this long long line...they have a woman speaking rapid fire with forced enthusiasm.....coaching and demanding that the crowd scream and cheer while finally boarding the ride. Spare me. The Manta is nothing more than a rather run of the mill roller coaster...which comes to almost a complete stop halfway through.Sea World San Diego is worth the visit if you're a tourist to San Diego or if you want to buy a yearlong pass as a regular. Bring your own stroller and save yourself the $12-$17 rental fee. Avoid their photo offers...a cheesy, overpriced group shot that you could take better on your own....for free.The meal with Shamu deal is fun and worth a visit. This buffet has some of the best food in the park. Be sure to sit away from the tank or your food and drinks will be saturated with the water the orcas and birds have been peeing in and worse.One final thought: If you decide to spring for a platinum pass for unlimited entry and parking IGNORE THEM when they try to convince you to buy platinum passes for each f your kids as well. They are lying to you to make a sale. I believed them. It cost a lot extra...for nothing. A silver pass for the kids would have sufficed."
1539,7/26/2015,2,"Overpriced and overhyped and not worth the $89 to get in. It's geared towards kids and not for adults. The dolphin show was great and liked the dolphin play pool, but would I pay $89 to see this again? No. Food was so overpriced, all I could afford to eat was a soda and an ice cream. I was one of the first in the park, yet the trash can was full at one of the eateries, so it obviously was from the day before. The Aquarium room was hotter inside than it was outside, so they don't have fans or a cooling system in there. I think we would have more fun for the price at the San Diego Zoo which will be our next destination."
1540,11/17/2014,5,"Was given tickets and my friend and I knew we had to make time to visit. I had never been before my visit here and it was an interesting adventure. The underwater world is fascinating on so many levels. Thankfully our tickets included parking otherwise when we found out the price we might have had to pay for park tickets as well as parking we both would have passed. However with free tickets in hand we made the morning drive to Seaworld. We had so much fun wandering the park. Popping in on different shows throughout the day and doing our best to take it all in. We came prepared with sunblock and me being very pale had to reapply a few times during the visit. This park has something for everyone. My favorite were the sealions. They are silly looking creatures, and a lot of fun to watch as they went through their training routines. By the end of the day we were both exhausted and ready for a good nights sleep. Very glad we had the chance to go, don't think I would visit again, but very happy that I got one visit in. If you've never been, you should give it a try. Especially if someone gives you free tickets"
1541,7/13/2014,3,"How good your experience is at this place really depends on the day that you go. Seriously. But that's how it is at most theme parks. If you go on a crowded Saturday, it is almost guaranteed that your day will suck. But even with small crowds and short lines, Seaworld toes the line between tedious and somewhat entertaining. The majority of their shows are really short, enraging people who sometimes wait more than an hour to get good seats. Almost all of their shows are in the open, causing parents and kids to be exposed to the hot sun for the duration of the show.. and the rest of their time at the park. Remember that news article about the trainer who was killed by a killer whale? Over the years, I think Seaworld has been forced to tone down the level of difficult (hazardous) tricks they can make their animals do. As a result, you don't see trainers performing daredevil tricks atop sea creatures. Now they just wave, talk a lot, and show dramatic videos about saving the Earth. In order to fill time in between repetitive, boring tricks, they perform ""crowd-pleasers"" such as splashing the crowd over and over and over again. This is not to say that you won't be entertained. It is still mildly entertaining (mostly for toddlers and young teens), and if you read my reviews on some of their shows you will notice that I give them high marks for effort and performance.The rest of the park is geared towards sapping visitors of every penny they have. Everything from ridiculously priced food to ridiculously priced photo-ops and souvenirs are there for the enthusiastic tourist to purchase. It's a nightmare for parents who pack poorly and have multiple, bratty kids. My recommendation: go on a weekday, preferably in the morning when it's nice and cool. Pack plenty of finger food and water. Plan the showtimes to watch all the shows, but try not to stress too much about getting good seats. Just relax and get the best view possible. No need to stand in line an hour just to sit in the front. Most of those seats are overrated anyway. The shows are short- remember? Oh, and leave the bratty kids at home (jk haha~)."
1542,6/28/2015,2,"I love Sea World Blackfish or not, but the Shamu and Dolphin show have gotten a little lame. And forget it if you have to call customer service for anything I have waited more than 40 minutes. Sure they offer call back but who know if your actually going to hear from anyone."
1543,5/20/2014,1,Sea world is dirty expensive the people park is dirty and staff is unfriendly. And the animals cages looks not kept up. And prices were of o the world expensive. Save you're money!
1544,4/2/2015,3,"Some of the whale and dolphin shows truly are amazing to watch. Â However, the prices of admission, the parking fees, and the concession stand rates add up, and it's tough to find a full day's worth of things to see."
1545,7/25/2015,4,"The Sea Lion Show is the best I've ever seen. The Dolphin Show is also very cute & very fun! The only reason I give them 4 stars, is because I don't think it's necessary for them to have killer whales at the park."
1546,2/14/2016,5,"My family and I love this place, we have passes for the passed 10 + years!! my kids always have a blast. They are there now for valentine's have a great time as always!!"
1547,5/29/2012,2,"So disappointed!! :(The only 2 things that made this visit worth any stars at all:Killer WhalesAtlantis RideThe Killer Whale show was AWESOME, but the times online did not match with the times posted when we arrived & the show itself was only 20 minutes in length. The Atlantis Ride is lots of fun, but lasts less than 5 minutes. Bummer. The rest of the rides sucked. The 'rapids' where slower than molasses & their only redeeming quality is that you might get some water on you due to a little splash or trickle. It was nothing like the Disney Rapids ride at all. As far as the animals (other than the killer whales), I've been to Aquariums in the middle of the desert with better looking displays & happier looking fish. Sad. Yes, the shark display was interesting, but over in 1 minute. What do you see LOTS of at SeaWorld? Gift Shops. They are EVERYWHERE!!!! For every 'exhibit/fish tank' there is a gift kiosk, free standing store & attached shop. I kid you not. You will also see tons of strollers & school groups. None of which have any respect for 'personal space', lol. Things that might make it better? Being a kid: they are too young too know better & they don't expect much. Going all out & purchasing an 'EXPERIENCE'. Maybe some one-on-one time with the dolphins or something would make it more memorable. Unfortunately those are pretty pricey."
1548,7/6/2010,2,"I have mixed feelings about Sea World. Â Orcas belong in the ocean not in a fish tank. Â When we force these majestic creatures to dwell in captivity Â they get depressed and their dorsal fins droop. Â I have no doubt the orcas are well-fed. Â However, Â maybe they require more than an abundance of food to thrive??Last year in Orlando, a trainer was killed when an orca seized her in his jaws, violently shook her and dragged her underwater. Â As a result, the trainers no longer swim with the whales. Â  It's a noticeable departure from the past. Â Although the trainers refrain from even dipping one tentative toe in the tank, they still hop and dance around on stage dressed in black wetsuits, closely resembling seals. Â It's not hard to understand why an orca's prey instinct would be triggered by these antics despite their somnolescent state. Â I gave the park two stars because my kids absolutely love Sea World. Â They also love violent video games, coca cola and staying up all night with their friends. Â If I'm going to slam Sea World I would have to knock the zoo too and I'm not prepared to do that. Â I must say that the circus is definitely not worth the guilt anymore though. Â  It's evident that animals suffer for our enjoyment and convenience. Â That's the way the world is....for now. Â Witness the oil spill.Sea World has a host of marine life on display. Â You will encounter penguins, dolphins, polar bears, sharks, manta rays, sea lions...I could go on. Â I don't think any unfortunate marine creature is unrepresented.The pet show features dogs, cats and a very cute pig that wags its tail. Â The trainers made sure to mention that all of the pet stars are rescue animals.The conservation message at Sea World gets a little old. Â Maybe I'm too jaded to ""Believe.""There are a few amusement rides, carnival games & a water play area for the kids at the park. Â Prepare to get soaked if you ride Atlantis or raft the ""roaring rapids."" If you do plan to visit Sea World, buy your tickets online to avoid the long and inefficient lines at the park entrance. Â The food is expensive, especially if you spend a full day at the park. Â Outside food and beverages are not allowed and the security guards are diligent about searching every backpack to weed out offenders who attempt to smuggle in brandy to get through the Sea World experience. Â A new option for the financially-challenged is to purchase an unlimited food ticket which gives the visitor free range to nibble on every delicacy Sea World has to offer.On second thought, it might be a good idea if you just said to ""no"" to the kids when they ask for churros, frozen lemonade and fried butter sticks. Â America needs to go on a diet. Â Just look around."
1549,7/7/2012,1,"Besides the crappy food, the crappy animal tricks, & the mediocre rides, this place might be the worst amusement park in california."
1550,6/15/2012,4,"Yes, I admit now, I love shamu and I had a dream one day, when I ever become a millionaire, I want to have shamu at home. While the dream is still far-reaching the reality, I decided to visit Seaworld where Shamu are the biggest star. It's been almost 4 years since I visited Seaworld, however, my last week's visit seems to make me feel that either the park is getting smaller or I'm getting taller with bigger steps, I don't know. I still like visiting this park cause it's not as crowded as Disneyland and it's more relaxing, slow-paced, plus totally affordable. I was looking forward to feed the dolphins as the last time I visited, however, they don't have that anymore, only feeding bat rays/sting rays is allowed now. Anything to do to get close to dolphins, you have to pay more. Oh well, dolphins are not on the top of my list, so I'm okay with it. I wish they have experience with Shamu as an option. Shamu shows are still amazing and dolphins show combined with the splashing pilot whale is great too, though the plot is a bit cheesy, but it's still entertaining. Don't sit in the wet area if you don't intend to get wet, cause even at the highest stand by wet area, we still got wet. Since my ticket is still valid until end of the year, I'll be back and update the review."
1551,5/20/2015,3,"Don't forget sunblock!! Slap some on your scalp too... Ouch. SeaWorld didn't excite me. It's small. Not much to do. There's a splash pad in the sesame area.WARNING! If you sit in the soak zone during the Shamu show, you will be drenched! You won't just get wet, you'll be soaking wet! Dress appropriately if you plan on getting soaked. We sat in the fourth row to the side away from the center stage. We were done for."
1552,12/3/2012,4,"I wasn't sure if I would enjoy SeaWorld, but it was actually pretty entertaining. The dolphins are playful and sweet, and will let you toss a frisbee for them to fetch. There are various aquariums full of beautiful fish, turtles, sharks. You can pick up sea stars or pet manta rays. There is an Arctic area with penguins, one lonely polar bear, a fiesty walrus, several belugas... the list goes on and on. It's a great place for anyone who loves animals or wants to learn more about the life aquatic.It's a bit expensive, so make sure you get your moneys worth and check out as many of the shows as you can.As much as I dislike seeing these creatures in captivity, it makes me feel better that they are not being killed in the wild. This is basically a circus of marine animals, but they seem to be happy and very well fed. Then again, can any of us speak seal, or dolphin, or whale?"
1553,6/26/2013,3,"As a kid, I have been to SeaWorld a number of times. Â Most recently, I went with my boyfriend and his family after scoring some free tickets to the SeaWorld Summer Nights kickoff event. Â Went on their new roller coaster, Manta. Â That was probably the scariest ride I have ever been on, but I definitely enjoyed it. Â Didn't really go on the other rides because I didn't want to get wet. Â The Shamu show was kind of lame. Â I just remember it being so much more when I was a kid...Overall, I feel that unless you can somehow score some free or deeply discounted tickets to SeaWorld, it's not really worth the money. Â For about $70 a pop I would rather pay $20 more and go to Disneyland for the day."
1554,3/16/2010,4,"I think that SeaWorld is probably my favorite theme park as far as theme parks go. It's the best value for your money although it IS expensive but its so worth it!The whole park is setup in a well organized, well navigated manner in such a way that you can completely just walk around in one direction and see everything there is to see. There are no weird cutways or pathways that you forgot to take that made you forget to see something. All of their exhibits are fairly clean and new looking not old and worn out. They provide a ton of useful information on all of their animals and there are so many interactive opportunities such as dolphin feedings and penguin feedings.Their shows are also awesome attractions, they're very entertaining and enjoyable (save for when Shamu tries to kill the trainer...) and overall the whole place gives you this nice happy feeling that you're somewhere good. Not somewhere dingy, dumpy, gross and dirty or run down at all. The food here is actually pretty decent and I love their plushed animals in all the gift stores. I'm a sucker for stuffed animals! Recommended visit for sure."
1555,4/13/2014,1,"My family and I went here a week ago. Sea World is more about commercialism then fun. The animals looked so sad, there were so many animals in one exhibit. The shows were good, in my opinion it was to hands on because some parents have not taught their children how to respect animals. I highly doubt we will be going back."
1556,2/15/2015,2,Parking entrance and especially exit need extreme amount of work!!! Extremely disorganized... It took us 25 mins to get onto sea world drive!!!!
1557,1/9/2017,1,"Very disappointed. Went to the park on Monday Jan 9 nearly everything is closed. Including both water rides, roller coaster and even shamu stadium. They should close the park for that day if they needs to do major maintenance instead of wasting our time."
1558,8/31/2016,2,"Not worth the price of the admission at the gate IMO. The park looks kind of run down, cracked sidewalks with crappy patch jobs,old faded oxidized paint on several attractions, the water around the Sea World tower was disgustingly dirty with trash. best part of it was there was hardly any crowd.The entire park seemed to have a burnt corn smell the entire time. The designated smoking area had over flowing ashtrays and were generally messy looking. I have seen it, my wife has seen it and the kids have seen it, I see no further reason to come back here in the future."
1559,2/11/2017,1,"I am sorry Seaworld You really ruined my day due to poor customer service. I tried to purchase the $10 fun card online. After registering my daughter, it shows me I have to pay for regular price for her. So I called Seaworld the next day, the staff told me on the phone to just bring the registration and my fun card and just pay the $10 fee for my daughter when we get to Seaworld. We got there today and was told that we have to buy her the fun card online. Your staff did not assist us to purchase the $10 at the front desk and pushed us away leaving two screaming kids in the car. If you have some unprofessional staff misguided your customer, I expect you would at least fix your own mistake."
1560,3/5/2014,1,I brought my kid here years ago. Never went back. It's just depressing seeing these highly intelligent animals cooped up in tanks and being treated like circus animals. You want to see whales? Go on a whale watching boat ride. Or go to Birch aquarium to see fish.
1561,6/18/2010,4,"After walking through Sea World recently I was surprised at how small it feels. My last recollection of going through here as a kid made it seem like a gigantic place full of animals, lights, balloons and rides that stretched on forever. But the adult me can no longer comprehend the amount of time and entertainment that goes with a simple act such as getting your face painted.But even for adults, Seaworld has a number of nice things to ponder. I was here as part of special evening event, so I didn't try the rides. But all the shows were available and were fairly impressive. There's a certain amount of cheesiness to all of them; they do have to be wide-ranging family entertainment after all. Still, the actual tricks performed by the dolphins especially are worth noting. The rest of the amusement park is a little bit barren: there's a few rides (the water ride Atlantis seems to be worth trying) and some places to eat. I'm not so sure that it's more of an afternoon visit for adults, but for a family outing there are a few extra entertainment areas for kids which could make this a full-day outing. I suppose the one bright thing would be that there does appear to be a fair amount of space surrounding the park (now used for parking). So if they expanded and added a few rides, that would be a significant Upgrayedd."
1562,9/5/2012,4,"My first experience few years back was definitely a lot better but I still enjoyed it this time! WHY DID YOU GUYS TAKE OUT THE CIRQUE DE LA MER SHOW???? That was the best show ever!!!!! I'll definitely come back next time when you have this again.Parking: $15. Admission: $73 at the gate but I recommend you look for deals online and sometimes you could get it cheaper! We paid $50/head. This deal is about to end though. So just surf around for one. You print out the ticket and just go straight to the entrance, no need to wait! I didn't have the whole day at Seaworld so I tried to pick out the best things to do there and here it is:Rides:I think they have total of 6-7? Here are the ones that I did ride on:1. JOURNEY TO ATLANTIS: The blue one toward the entrance. This one is the COOLEST ride ever!!! They start you off by dropping which is the opposite at other parks? Then they lift you up to go on roller coaster. It was short but I loveeeee it!!!2. MANTA I guess that's the next best roller coaster ride that they have to offer. For this ride, it's MANDATORY that you put away your backpack, crossbody purse, etc! You needa get a locker which is free for the first hr at the nearby gift shop.3. SHIPWRECK RAPIDS: The ride is nothing different from other parks...EXCEPT they do have a waterfall at the end so you WILL get wet no matter what. 4. SKY RIDE: I wanted to go on this but the line was toooo long!! It was at least 40 mins wait but maybe cause we went during the holidays? It would be nice to chill after a long day.Shows:1. ONE OCEAN (Shamu): This is one of the best shows there and I love it each time I'm there. It's too bad that the trainers no longer stand on the whale when they do the performance though! I sure do miss it but it was nice regardless. You'll get SUPER wet if you sit in the wet zone. The whales will purposely wet you mad!!! I like to sit all the way on the top though, better view of everything. 2. BLUE HORIZONS: I enjoyed the dolphin show a lot too. They were really awesome.3. SEA LIONS TONIGHT or LIVE: YOU MUST GO SEE THIS!!!! It was hilariouss!!!!!! The sea lions did some reallly cute stuffs!! There are exhibits for you to check out too but I didn't think they were important, Â so I didn't. I did check out the Wild Artic and it was okay in my opinion. Just go straight to see the animals...don't do the LAME 3D Ride...that was HORRIBLE!!!"
1563,11/28/2014,2,"Won our tickets on the radio. $84 per person and $16 to park otherwise. I realize the employees need to be paid, and the animals need to be fed, but give me a break, a couple of rides does not make this place an amusement park. The shows are the same tired ones from years ago, save your money and head to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, the Los Angeles Zoo, and Magic Mountain in Valencia."
1564,2/25/2010,2,"I've put off reviewing SeaWorld for a number of reasons, but in light of yesterday's killing of an Orlando SeaWorld trainer by Shamu--not a first-time incident, mind you--I've been inspired.I should first note that I in no way support PETA or similar animal rights groups, and my feelings aren't a result of the documentary film The Cove or anything like that; my opinions are based on numerous first-hand trips to SeaWorld over years combined with simple facts.Moving on...As a child I visited several SeaWorlds (and zoos) around the country probably a dozen times. Â And did I enjoy those excursions as a child? Â Of course I did! Â If you love animals, then it's very easy to either love or hate SeaWorld (and zoos). Â It's just that, as an educated adult, my opinions today differ greatly from the ones of my childhood days. Â These days I don't support the holding of large wild animals captive for show, and, although I'll likely take my future children to SeaWorld at least once, I haven't myself been to SeaWorld in years. Â When it comes to this topic the biology nerd inside me tends to overpower my self-control, and thus I can't help but state the obvious: Â Shamu is an orca, a ""killer whale."" Â Just because Shamu performs at shows and gets cuddled and hand-fed fish doesn't make him/her a pet, and anyone would be foolish to believe that's the case. Â Zoological and biological issues aside, SeaWorld is a sickening, money-making, money-hungry empire in my eyes. Â My last trip to San Diego SeaWorld (in December 2005) saddened me--so mainstream, so overrated. Â And so freakin' expensive--from the parking to the bottled water to the souvenirs to those little cones of fish you buy to feed the seals and/or sea lions. Â I shudder to think how prices have likely increased during the last 4 years! Â There's one thing that tops the comical idea that orcas should be held captive and trusted to perform safely with trainers: Â from the years 1981 to 2004 San Diego SeaWorld held the record for the length of time a great white shark has survived in captivity--just over 2 weeks, I believe. Â Yeah, SeaWorld knows a money maker when they see it. Â Count them in, even if the idea of holding a great white captive is ludicrous!"
1565,10/25/2014,3,"Like all the info u learn and used to go more but they keep raising rates and after watching the documentary ""black fish"" not so sure if I would go back now."
1566,7/17/2012,4,"I think I love this place for several reasons: 1) I looooove animals and I love petting them etc. Â You can go to the bat ray area and pet them. Â Sometimes they'll even have showings of other animals you can interact with. Â I've seen and touched baby ducklings, a hedgehog, some crazy snake, etc. Â 2) It's pretty clean...much cleaner than any zoo I've been to. 3) Interactive (as mentioned above in #1) 4) Every time I've gone it hasn't been super packed or crowded, so you're not waiting on huge, long lines. 5) They let you in free if you have a military ID.6)One of the only places I can find the Budweiser lime beer in a aluminum bottle...I know it's weird, but watching the Shamu show and sipping on this refreshing drink was great."
1567,6/15/2013,4,"Just recently received an Annual ""Fun Pass"" for being a teacher!We will be back soon again to see all the new attractions!!! I hope to see ""Blue Horizons"" next time!"
1568,9/7/2009,5,"Wow! I came on the Sunday before Labor Day and was surprised. It has been at least 15 years since I have been here. The park's attractions are relatively close to each other and there is not too much walking or waiting involved. It was hot, but the park has several attractions that are nice for cooling you down. My favs: 1. Killer Whale Show 2. Dolphin Show 3. Sea Lions 4. Arctic Circle--Nice and Cool. 5. The 4D Elmo show which totally cools you down and you can sit and relax for a bit. My favorite parks are Disneyland, The Wild Animal Park, and SEAWORLD!!"
1569,2/5/2015,3,This was our first trip to sea world San Diego. We arrived about 15 minutes after they opened and had to stand in the line to get tickets. It took us about 45 minutes to an hour just to get to a person for tickets. When we finally got up there the person behind the counter seemed to have a chip on her shoulder. To make a long story short we got horrible customer service from this lady too the point where she threatened to get a manager on US! The manager came over and resolved the issue within 30 seconds. The rest of the day went fine but I would say the highlight of this place are their shows. After the treatment we received I'm not sure we'll be back again.
1570,2/21/2014,1,"Wow, SeaWorld keeps deleting everyones negative reviews from Yelp. Â This place is depressing and not a good value for your dollar, very happy to never come here ever again. Â The place is in shambles. Â Tip for non California natives: when in San Diego you can see whales in the wild on a tour boat practically year round, though its best in the spring."
1571,3/27/2012,1,"What happened to Sea World????Anheuser Busch sold it in 2009 is what happened.Last weekend was the first time back to Sea World since 2008. Â And man has it gone down hill.1. No more beer garden, AYCE BBQ and clydesdale horses.2. The Dolphin show is more Cirque Solis then dolphin. Â The show is more about humans diving and spinning over the water then about the animals.3. Shamu show was terrible...hardly any trainer/animal interaction4. And they have closed the Rocky Point Reserve...where you pet the dolphins, to install a new steel roller coaster.5. The biggest rip is they have raised the ticket prices to $75 plus a $15 parking feeIf i wanted roller coasters, I'll go to Six Flags...cheaper and a ton of more coastersIf I wanted entertainment, I'll go to Disneyland...a little bit more expensive but a much bigger bang for your dollar.I went to Sea World to experience animals and that seems to be quickly scaled back"
1572,2/8/2015,5,"Been here yesterday, the shamu show is cute and nice!! They are all well trained!! I am shocked that shamu is able to follow all the instruction that gave!! Wonderful day spent over here, pls get the one year ticket, it worth to to go more than once."
1573,5/30/2014,5,"I'm pro SeaWorld now for a couple of reasons. The first reason is because they took in tons of displaced animals during the recent SD fires, and the second reason is because I hate PETA and their worthless efforts in helping any animals."
1574,1/25/2013,4,"We're locals so I LOVE SeaWorld. My husband and I got the annual pass through Costco for $99/person and it includes free parking! It's a small park, but the shows are always entertaining, the food is eh, the rides are fun. We mostly go to enjoy spending time with family and we love bringing our niece here. It's a great way to spend the afternoon if you have time. I love that they offer so much free interactive things for little kids. They have the small water area for kids, then the starfish area where you can pet them, and occasionally workers are walking birds, donkeys, or sloths through and they will stop for you. Always a great time."
1575,3/5/2012,1,"I HATE SEAWORLD!!!!!!When I found that my child was going on a field trip to Seaworld and tickets would only be $6.00, I was so excited. Â I've been wanting to go for a long time but couldn't justify the $73 dollar admission ticket.If you are going on a field trip here they make you park on the south side of the park. Which is no where near the front entrance. Â Why am I mentioning this? Â Field trip guest Â have only half a day visit. Â If you stay past the time allotted you cant exit the south gate and must exit the main entrance and probably need a taxi to get to your car as these parking lots are located miles from each other. Â You are expected to to arrive at 9 am while your teacher checks-in. Â That took over 50 minutes. Â I dont want to sound like a princess but it was miserable when you have to wait on blacktop with no shade and small children. Â Then we are herded into the park and given a map. Â I thought that was nice except this map had almost every great attraction marked out with an ""X"". Â We were only allowed to attend some of the shows (no Shamu) and all the animal exhibits. Â We weren't even allowed in Elmo's play area but we went anyway. Â Suck it Seaworld!I know the field trip was suppose to be educational but the the only thing that can really be learned here is how they can take animals out of their own natural habitat to make them perform for millions of people for millions of dollars. Â I have small boys and am not sure if it's their disposition or if it's just because they are boys but they don't care for the shows. Â I am so glad I went here for only $6 because I can not fathom the full admission price. Â It's as expensive as Disneyland but without all the fun. I know Seaworld has created new attractions like ""swim with Shamu"" or the big roller coaster they recently added. Â All these things to boost sales because they are hurting financially. Â I have an idea! Lower your admission price so more people can come see your lame shows. Â Next time I want to see a bunch of seals, ill just head over to La Jolla cove where it's free."
1576,3/13/2012,4,"Yeah I bet you don't know that they have free beer here! Well at least that is one of my favorite parts about Sea World, let alone, Shamu, the Penguins, and a million other sea creatures. The shows definitely add to the levity and bring a bit of fun to things. Literally every major type of sea creature can be found here from dolphins, killer whales, penguins, fish of all types, sharks, otters, sea lions, etc. Almost all of them participate in various shows showing off all kinds of humor and a great relaxed way to spend a day. The shows each have a theme to them which allows for a lot more enjoyment. However, My favorite show is at the end of the day, one of the main theaters (WWII set) does a spoof on all the other shows from throughout the day. This is by far the best show and provides a bit of levity to the day. Allowing things to end with a great big smile.The Anheuser Busch premium brands tasting facitily has a bunch of specialty beers that are on tap at no charge here. This makes for a great way to spend lunch as they have lunch ordering location in the same building. Their are usually about 15-30 different adult beverages available for sampling. Most of the beverages are on tap, however a few are bottled and available that way as well. The bartenders will pour for you, unfortunately the samples come in 4 oz servings :(There is an AYCE bbq booth near the tasting facility. However I found that it is not the best quality for the cost. Granted I havent eaten it recently.Sea World has a special offer for So Cal residents and that is buy a day and get the year for free. This is a great offer, especially if you are from San Diego and have kids. Enjoy the people watching, know that parking cost is minimal (compared to other similar types of places), and that fun / frivolity are readily had at this wonderful facility. Heck even most of the bathrooms are fairly clean with family restrooms available, making it easy for parents with multiple children or who are the opposite sex to easily take care of their childrens sanitary needs.I am looking forward to taking my daughter here again soon.Pro Tip - AAA and Military discounts are available!"
1577,11/19/2015,5,We are annual passholders. We love Seaworld. My boys and I go all the time. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Thank you for helpping to make our family memories that much more special.
1578,9/12/2012,3,"My family and I came here for a little vacation. Here are the positive things I like about Sea World... The shows are fun, the park seems well kept, and AAA does have good deals with ticket prices.THE NEGATIVEParking is tight and a little disorganized. SECURITY is just plain BAD! My brother parked his truck right by a security tower specifically between C2 and C1. Someone broke into my brother's truck w/ an alarm jammer and stole my mother's purse. This happened withing the 5 minutes we walked away from the vehicle and returned to fetch the tickets we forgot to for re-entrance. My suggestion is never leave anything in your cars.... SeaWorld parking is not safe! No camera's to help capture the thieves."
1579,2/17/2013,4,"I haven't been to Sea World in quite a few years but thought today would be a good day to go and get the ""Fun Pass"" Â It was a little amazing though to  pay $15.00 for Â parking on top of the $78.00 ticket price and you can upgrade to park closer to the entrance for an additional $5.00, really? Â We did not take the offer and we were Â just one parking spot off the special parking place - and so we were glad we didn't fall for the extra expense! Â I guess everybody is trying to make a buck somehow, just have to be careful.The park is exceptionally clean and well maintained and the staff along with all the shows were fantastic. Food is a little over priced though; as an example for $3.25 Â you can get a small bowl of BBQ beans at the Calypso BBQ (which I had to pay for first as they don't have them there at the counter) Â  What Â I recieved Â is totally unacceptable, especially when you're paying 14.25 for the meal itsel because it was less than a cup and it was nothing more than RANCH STYLE BEANS out of a can (and I know it because I eat them at home!). Overall it was a great day and that's the reason for the 4 stars, but I'll be taking my both my grand daughters there when they come to town in a month or so."
1580,7/10/2009,4,"I am now the proud holder of a Platinum Pass...go ahead, hate on me bitches!! HA HA HA...I kid, I kid.I've never been a fan of Shamu and think he/she is an asshole...Ever since I was a kid I just couldn't buy into the bull of Shamu and achieving the ""dream."" I guess Sea World considers the dream to be your purchasing countless souvenirs and overpriced food...or is it your paying them to feed their animals? Pretty clever idea there, Sea World. Get the idiot patrons to pay to not only see your animals but also to feed them. Completely genius. Up until February (I believe) Sea World offered what we like to refer to as ""beer school"" which is a fancy term for getting saucy (for free) while testing various beers and snacking on delicious crackers, cheeses and chocolates. For undisclosed reasons they have discontinued this, which is disheartening. There's nothing like viewing ginormous animals while tipsy on free alcohol!My most favorite animal in the world is the dolphin, and thanks to Sea World (and my desperate ex bf trying to impress me) I was able to achieve one of my life-long dreams; to swim with dolphins. Well, it wasn't quite swimming, but I was able to hang out with them in the tank and enjoy their company for a short while. It was awesome!! I also enjoy visiting them in the viewing tank and get excited like a fat kid eating cake when one swims up to say hello.The shows aren't really all that exciting, unless you watch the idiots in the audience who sit in the soak zone go crazy when they get splashed. I do have to admit that I'm actually very impressed by the ""Pets Rule"" show, because they have successfully trained cats, birds, pigs and many other household animals that seem like they'd be impossible to train.Viewing the sharks can be interesting at times although more often than not they prove to all that they are in fact the true assholes of the sea by upturning their noses at people. I'd pay anything to see that tank capsize and the sharks devour the very humans who point at them like idiots. The penguins are cool to check out, as are the polar bears and beluga whales. I believe the flamingos are there as filler, and the sea lions are more often than not very bitchy and bark at you all day.The rides are pretty fun but I wouldn't suggest going on them unless (1) you have a change of clothes (2) you are about to leave or (3) you enjoy walking around sopping wet all day. Since I am a platinum pass holder I get free parking (saves about 12 bucks a trip), VIP seating to shows, discounts on food, unlimited free rides on the sky ride and sky tower and much more for the low price of 11 bucks a month. If you are a San Diego resident, I suggest you invest in one of these, because it's a cool place to go when you've got nothing better to do and want to kill an hour or two. It's also nice to be able to come and not have to try and cram everything into one day's trip."
1581,8/19/2012,2,"I am so sorry to say, I was disapointed. Â The shows were aweful, the food worse and this place is not good for anyone under 43 inches.We took our neice and she could not go on any rides except for the three in the Sesame Street section and they entertained her for about 3 min. She liked the water shooting everywhere though.As for the shows. Â My family would come here at least twice a year and the show were great. Â The Orcas and dolphins would do wonderful tricks and the trainers were informative and entertaining. Â Not anymore. Â The Dolphin show was said to be 25 min. Â It was 5 min of the dolphin twirling in the water, waving, and splashing and one jump then they put them away and people came out dressed as birds to do a diving show for the other 20 min. Â My neice asked if we could leave. Â She could give a rip about it. Â It was much the same for the Orca show. Â On this one all the trainers do is play a recording here and there, no interaction with the audience and wave their arms and blow whistles at the Orcas. Â The Orcas gave good splash though. Â The rest of the time we just walked around and looked at the animal exhibits and fried in the sun. Â As for the food. Â It's an amuzement park. Need I say more. Â  All in all so sad."
1582,1/25/2015,4,What a blast! I came to Seaworld back in 2012 and was mesmerized by how well trained the whales and seals were! It was worth every single penny because there are many shows throughout the entire theme park...love shamu the most!
1583,8/14/2011,5,"This place was a lot of fun!My boyfriend and I went here a couple months back for my birthday and it was my first time going. The first thing we did was go eat at ""Dining with Shamu."" It included a buffet style breakfast and an up close and personal shamu show! It was incredible!After that, we walked around to see all the different shows. My favorites were the dolphin show and the main shamu show. I also loved petting the sting rays and looking at the sharks :)The only complaint I had was that I thought the food was overpriced and it was so crowded but we had been expecting this so it didn't ruin our good time. I would definitely go back!"
1584,2/18/2010,1,"Summary: apparently this park's target audience is now five-year-olds who don't speak English and don't know the difference between real life and Saturday morning cartoons. Â Give it a miss.I love the Zoo and the Wild Animal Park, and pretty much every aquarium I've ever been to, especially Monterey Bay and Baltimore. Â I own a saltwater fishtank and a scuba card, and am fascinated with the fishes. Â And though I've lived in San Diego for years, the last time I went to Sea World was when I was a little kid. Â As I recall I thought it was meh, okay, Marineland was better. Â Went today just for the heck of it and because my wife has been wanting to go. Â Parking was only $12, less than I was expecting, so that was good. Â Prices, and you already know, are insane, despite the fact that you get to come back for a year's worth of unlimited visits. Â We came after noon knowing we could go back (now I'm hoping we don't get around to it).Got here early afternoon, and there was a Shamu show starting soon. Â Despite the fact that the park seemed nearly empty, the Shamu amphitheater was packed. Â They were playing smarmy music and videos on cool screens above the tank, and the whales were frolicking. Â A performer came out to pander to the guests in uniform and rev up the crowd's unblinking patriotism. Â Finally the actual show started, and it got very ugly very quickly. Â Smarmy videos of a kid dreaming of whales and carving a wooden whale tail. Â Then, surprise, surprise, the kid is now the host. Â Cue even more smarmy videos and music.Now, the whales are awesome. Â  They leap in the air, they swim on their backs, they teach tricks to their young (the only fact I gleaned from the entire performance). Â They even push the performers around and splash the audience, just for grins. Â (Yeah, they grin, too.) Â So that was fine, and I've seen these shows before and it's interesting to learn about adapting natural behaviors blah blah - but there was none of that here. Â Smarm, smarm, smarm. Â Half an hour of this raw sugar had me fearing a spontaneous diabetic coma. Â If anyone from Sea World reads this, please please please ditch this crap and make some attempt to educate me rather than plucking at my heartstrings. Â I would never attend this show again, and I will recommend against it to anyone who will listen.The whales are amazingly cool. Â Spend some time watching them in the side tanks. Â Don't go near the stupid show.It seemed to take longer to get out of the amphitheater than we had spent suffering through the performance. Â The park has about half a dozen amusement rides - nothing Magic Mountain, but some that are pretty elaborate. Â For my money, I'd rather have seen more interesting aqualife exhibits. Â Of course, they appeared to all be shut down today. Â Maybe they only open them up in the summer? Â Doesn't matter to me, I'm there for the fish.My wife insisted the next stop be the pet show. Â This one I can't complain as much, as I knew what we were getting into. Â It wasn't nearly as awful as the Shamu show, but I could have seen better doggy and kitty acts on TV, without the kiddy smarm to go with them. Â It was a cool day for San Diego - t-shirt weather - and it was a Thursday afternoon in mid-february. Â The parking lot had a lot of cars, and the walkways near the shows were littered with parked strollers, but otherwise it was a ghost town. Â I guess everyone went to the Shamu show and then spent the next few hours in the restrooms voiding their lunches?We saw the penguins, and the sharks, the starfish pool and the saltwater aquarium building. Â Pretty underwhelming exhibits - the shark one being interesting to walk through the underwater tube, would have been better if it weren't on a moving walkway through a short stretch without a whole lot of sharks. Â As you walk around the park, and in the exhibit buildings, there's piped in smarmy muzak and soft christian rock that made my skin crawl when I noticed it (and I assume rotted my brain and encouraged me to be a better citizen, when I didn't notice it). This being weekday in February, most of the exhibits, restaurants, and shows were closed. Â Made me think of the restaurant where the food is lousy - and such small portions!With the park closing soon, we went over to the bat ray petting pool, which was actually my favorite part of the afternoon. Â Not sure the big guys like to be petted, but there's a kiosk selling $6 trays of fish niblets they do enjoy, so it's probably a fair bargain. Â I got to try out my waterproof video camera, and touch the soft silky wings of several 2-3 foot rays. Â This I might look forward to doing again, if I'm unlucky enough to get dragged back here.If you're looking for recommendations, give it a pass and hit the Birch Aquarium ( yelp.com/biz/birch-aquarâ€¦ ) instead. I haven't been there yet, but it can't possibly be any worse than this place."
1585,7/20/2013,4,We had a great time at Sea World! Â Our favorite was The Shamu Show. Â So cool! Â We also loved watching the beluga whales swim and the penguins...Amazing! Â It was really fun to feed the bat rays or sting rays. Â The sharks and turtles were also really cool!
1586,4/1/2012,2,"This is not the SeaWorld of my youth!! I feel guilty for talking my friends into dishing out the steep $73 admission price because I couldn't stop yapping about how it was a ""must see"" for those who are not native to SoCal.The dolphin show was like a poor man's cique de solis. AWKWARD. Maybe I'm a nerd, but I like hearing about the animals and watching the interactions between the trainers and the animals. We didn't even get to learn the dolphin's names!! The poor pilot whales that used to be in the show were just trapped in one of the back tanks and we only saw them as we were walking over the equally disappointing shamu show. SADNESS. Also, secretly my favorite part of the park was seeing the Budweiser Clydesdales and they aren't there anymore! I guess Anheuser Busch sold the park (along with it's integrity). Â So no horses and no beer school. Oh well."
1587,10/21/2010,2,"If Disneyland can claim to be the ""Happiest Place on Earth"", then Seaworld should use the tag line ""Saddest Place on Earth"". They can have the losing quarterback at the superbowl say ""I'm going to Seaworld"". Yes, it is that bad. Seaworld is a sad display of humanity. It takes previously free animals and forces them to perform tricks for their corporate masters. Honestly, it is probably the only place where the majority of people are going to be able to see Dolphins, Orcas, Sharks, etc... the down side is that it takes these once free animals, teach them tricks and locks them up in a swimming pool for the rest of their lives. I am sure these animals would be much happier in the ocean. As for the park itself, its not that great. kind of run down. everything over priced, as expected, and no more free beer samples!! There is no happiness at Seaworld and I will never come back. 2 stars for being able to see these poor animals which I would never get to see otherwise."
1588,10/22/2012,4,"Sea World let's us have 4 free tickets as military a year, which is great because we couldn't afford to go otherwise. This place is fantastic because of the all you can eat wristbands which are definitely worth the money. In fact, for amusement park food this place has great stuff. So there is that. I home school a 9 year old and I also have a 2 year old so there aren't that many places where both of them can get something out of it like SeaWorld. The Sesame Street play areas and rides are great because I can wear her out right as we get in, and then spend a good part of the day checking out the other attractions. In fact, we can spend all day here- learn something, have some fun with the toddler, take in some shows, walk around, ride the attractions and eat to our hearts content. The only thing preventing SeaWorld from getting 5 stars in my eyes is that the Manta Ray ride is always broken when we go, so we have never gotten the chance to ride it. Additionally, it can be expensive and we would like to go more often but ticket prices are more than other local attractions. I really enjoy that it is never too busy there either. All in all, when we shell out the cash SeaWorld never lets us down."
1589,4/6/2016,1,My experience wasn't great. There are protesters in front of the building. Â I was intrigued to what they were promoting. Â I talked to a few of them. Â It really opened my mind.. but I had already have paid tickets. Â I went inside and couldn't believe how small it was(Tanks). Â Screaming kids everywhere too. Â It was dirty as well. Â I've done my research since then on how the animals are treated and I regret ever putting my money to SeaWorld.
1590,9/27/2016,4,"Visited Seaworld on 9/26/2016. It was my two year old sons first time. And I have not been in YEARS.We payed for preferred parking $22 and basically got first row because we showed up when the park barley opened. Next we wait in line for my ticket.. I told the gentleman working the counter I wanted to do something extra for my son on our first seaworld trip, penguin experience, dolphin, dine with shamu or something??He started to explain the passes and how I should get a year pass or whatever, I told him no , we are okay. I just want to know about the other things previously mentioned.I read that they don't recommend the penguins Â except for 6 and up so I told him we will dine with Shamu at 1oclock. He tells me okay, if you get there 30 minutes early and are first in line you can pick where you sit. Cool.So we're off, first things first we go to the kids area, it's was super slow in the area so we rode all the rides in what seemed like 5 minutes lol.The attendant even offered to let everyone stay on instead of get off and walk around again.So then we headed to the dolphin show...We were kind of late so they told us we HAD to sit up at the top right even though I saw open seating right in the front middle... after about ten minutes of heat, we opted to walk down and do something else. My two year old saw the shamu bubble blower so we got one of those. And walked over to the concession and got some ice cream and cold drinks.We went into the shark exhibit, which was probably one of my favorite parts of the day! I thought it was very cool, my son was kinda scarred but we made it out without him crying.Then we went to feed the sea lions and otters... sooooo cool. We bought three things of the fish at $5 a piece.At this point my son was over walking so we went back to the front to get a stroller.It was about 12:10pm so I thought we should head over to shamu so we could get a good seat for lunch.We were first in line, it was pretty hot, and my son was pretty irritable. But every couple minutes more people showed up and the line got to be pretty long. So I was happy we got there first UNTIL we checked in- the guy said ""oh it's all reserved seating it doesn't matter what time you got here, the best seats are by the glass"" So I asked if our reservations were for by the glass, they were not.So I was pretty ticked off.Then I found out that lunch was a buffet, you couldn't even order off of a menu. My salmon had the bones all over in it. And I was just not pleased with the food.There was an open table at the glass so after we ate we kept going over there to watch the whales as for the table in front of ours kept standing up to take pictures.The entire experience just sucks.After we got done doing that we went back to play area, touched some tiger fish and headed to the gift shop.I got my son a shark, a toy and a cup.I saw guest services so I headed over and told them about the lunch and they fully refunded me- which I was happy about. A lot of the consession stands where closed I'm sure due to it being slow but it was really hot and we had to walk for for drinks and they had no games open.I spent about $400 and to me it just wasn't worth it.We have done Disneyland, Legoland, universal studios and knots, and to be honest sea world is just really lacking.THE ANIMALS LOOKS VERY HAPPY AND WELL TAKEN CARE OF.Some of these reviewers need to stop watching blackfish"
1591,10/16/2012,1,"This was one place we decided to stop on my honeymoon.In our experience, we only went because it was free (with CityPass) and we had already went to Universal and Disneyland. Â After visiting those parks we noticed that there were not enough shows and hardly any rides. Â We were also disappointed that there were little to no opportunities to interact with animals.Shamu was the best show... Sesame Street wasn't bad either.Staff is somewhat rude and totally unhelpful compared to the 2 other noted parks.We would only recommend going if you get the citypass - otherwise pass on this park. Â The little ones wont enjoy it and you will scratch your head wondering why you made the trip."
1592,7/23/2014,4,"I like this SeaWorld, it's a nice amusement park and the shows are pretty cool with enough times throughout the day (on weekends especially) to see them all if you get there early. Â It has some great exhibits and a couple rides as well. Â It is pricier than the San Diego Zoo and its club membership program isn't as good as the zoo's either. Â So for that alone, I got to knock it down a bit. Â But when you got great exhibits and shows from cirque de soleil.. err de la mar, to sea lions that are pretty entertaining to watch, it makes the experience worth it. Â A great place to take friends and family who are visiting."
1593,3/22/2015,5,Had a great day! Â Within minutes of being in the park we had already interacted with multiple animals. Â Nothing against zoos but sea world offer a far more personal experience with its animals. Â My only real complaint was the choice of music for the dolphin and orca shows pretty cheesy. Â The sea lion show was a great hit though. Â Would love to go back next time I'm in the area.
1594,7/31/2014,1,"A mob scene and waste of money. Â Too many people to see the small, overcrowded exhibits, Atlantis, the best attraction not working, the shows were cheesey and not nearly as good as they use to be. Â Greedy place oversold tickets. Â  Won't return!"
1595,7/22/2012,4,"Things have definitely changed since the last time I've been here. You can't feed the dolphins anymore (you can still touch them tho), can't take the starfish out of their pools, and there are no more trainers in the water w/ the killer whales. Â The Shamu show isn't the same since the trainers don't go in the water anymore, but it's understandable why. A killer whale killed its trainer during a show in Florida in 2010, so a judge has said that there must be a physical barrier btwn the whales and its trainers when they are near each other & cannot be in the water together during a show I believe. Blue Horizon (dolphin & pilot whale show) isn't as fun as it used to be anymore either. Â I feel as if this show & the Shamu show focuses more on the trainers than the animals themselves. The lines for the rides are pretty darn long. Â Shipwreck rapids went up to over 90 minutes, Manta Ray was about 45 min, and Journey to Atlantis was 75 min (it took less than that tho). Â Manta is faster than I thought it would be. My stomach flipped a good amount of times. Â Food's alright. I always go to the Calypso Bay Smokehouse & order their brisket. It's pretty good but I heard their desserts and fruits taste pretty gross. Â Their churros are a hit/miss. Â The first one was good but the second one was hard, oily, and tasted old. Â Their turkey legs are pretty good. Clean bathrooms! If you want to save some money, make sure to bring your own water bottles in. Â Also, if you buy the sports bottle, it's only 99 cents for a refill. Â Plus, you can bring that back whenever you visit! Make sure you keep the straw tho."
1596,5/1/2012,5,"We recently returned from a trip to San Diego where we visited Legoland, SeaWorld, and the San Diego Zoo. Â Our daughter had so much fun on her trip.We LOVED SeaWorld! Â We loved that they had the ""Sesame Street Bay of Play"" section for toddlers and little kids. Â Our 2 yr old daughter loved riding Elmo's Flying Fish and I think the highlight of her day may have just been meeting Elmo and Big Bird. Â The rest of the section was so much fun and a neat addition to make sure that there is something for everyone, including the littlest visitors.Toddler stuff aside, we were really impressed with how peaceful and tropical it felt at SeaWorld (loved the tropical music they had playing everywhere), and seeing all the animals. Â We saw the ""One Ocean"" Shamu show, and coming from someone who had never been to SeaWorld in her 30+ years of life, I was impressed with it and enjoyed it. Â Our daughter loved it and I wasn't sure if at 2 yrs old, she would love sitting through a show, but there was enough action going on that she was Thrilled!, screaming and clapping every time the whales did jumps and spins!We spent 6 hours at the park and could have spent longer (we saw only 2 shows + the Sesame Street 4D show - so 3 shows in all) but our 2 yr old was getting tired so we headed out after 6 hours. Â We could have easily spent a few more hours or even a 2nd day to see everything and hit a couple rides had it just been my husband and myself, but we wanted to hit the Zoo the next day, so we'll come back again on a return trip to SD.As usual, I got a discount on tickets to get us in to the park and did not pay full price (our daughter was free since she's under 3) and that was a nice savings. Â Do your homework before arriving!"
1597,1/10/2015,5,"The staff is incredibly friendly and despite recent accusations (blackfish, PETA) they still do all that they love with a smile on their face. I've recently come into contact with a fur seal, Megan, that actually lost half of her brain due to algae poisoning and you can now find me there every week visiting her. I strongly recommend you find her and call her name out because she LOVES people and may even follow you around! The trainers & information people are so nice and very informative and can answer any question you have. The people working food stands are also very kind and funny. Never had a bad experience here and I've been too many times to count!"
1598,8/5/2016,5,"I love this place, they know how to do things right , the employees help for everydody about all, its good place for family with children's, i Â realy recommend to go there,"
1599,4/18/2015,3,"My six years old daughter enjoyed seeing dolphins in real life versus just in books. Â She had a great time at Sea World, which means I had a great time watching her have a great time. Â She enjoyed watching the trainers and dolphins at Dolphin Point over the actual shows.As a child, I remember watching the orca and dolphin shows at Marineland (now defunct) in Southern California. Â From my memories, the shows back then where more entertaining and acrobatic in nature. Â Today, Sea World's orca and dolphin shows seems more about dog tricks (wave, speak, roll over, etc...) and splashing the audience."
1600,7/10/2013,4,"Spent a nice day at Sea world and was happy as usual. Â I was unaware there was a baby whale that was born recently so I was pleasantly surprised. As usual, the food is pretty damn good for a theme park! Â Always impressed with the food quality here. Â I was especially pleased with an employee by the name of Shaq that personally walked my girlfriend and I over to where the baby whale could be easily seen. Â This employee went above and beyond my expections for a theme park employee, you could really tell he enjoys his job and was happy to help!"
1601,6/13/2007,1,"With another full day of conference for Roger, the kids and I headed over to Sea World Saturday. Â  Seriously, overall we had a great time taking in shows, doing the tide pools, and walking/breathing/seeing all things under the sea. Â  The kids really enjoyed the Pets Rule show and my all-time favorites are Shamu and the dolphins. Â   Â  Â  What was scary for us was that as we were leaving the park, while the kids were walking in a beautifully grassy area near the Hospitality Center Jd4 stepped on a small sewer drain cover (probably only about 8"" diameter) which was partially open because it wasn't bolted down and fell in thigh deep! Â Her sandal got stuck in some sprinkler piping and I had to take her sandal off before I could get her leg out (very muddy, of course). Â  Â  Â  Although she appeared to be fine to me she said that her ankle hurt her and so not wanting to take any chances I rushed over to a worker to see if I could get some ice. Â Well, considering the fleet of medical personnel/ AI squad that appeared on the scene (which I found out during the course of the treatment stood for Accident Investigation) you'd think something much more serious had happened. Â  Â  Â  What I was disappointed in was the number of times I'd have to repeat my story and the ""reports"" they had to file just to get some ice. Â I realized that more than showing any concern for my daughter's well-being they were more interested in potential loss prevention. Â But, ironically enough, after Jd4 was ""treated"" and deemed ok and as we were walking away I noticed that the Sea World team of 6 started to disperse too.  Â  Â That's when I nearly lost it. Â It wasn't so much that I had to file a report before they would give me a simple ice pack; or the number of times I'd have to repeat what had happened; or that Os3 was starting to have a melt-down because he had been forced and strapped into his stroller and was reminding me all to repeatedly that he wanted milk (which I had run out of); or that I had had a very full day with 4 active kids in a very crowded theme park. Â No- aside from all that, what I could NOT believe was that they didn't leave a worker to guard that defective sewer drain to ensure no one else slipped into it! Â  Â  When I exasperatedly pointed out (a tad bit frustrated) that the other sewer drains ALL had their covers BOLTED down but that this particular drain cover wasn't bolted down which caused the accident to begin with...and we were extremely lucky that she wasn't injured...(anyone heavier or older, I'm sure would have broken something)... they finally seemed to catch on. Â Or maybe it was because I insisted and even looked back suspiciously after we had walked away 10 yards or so to make sure a worker was still there...They said they'd call me a few days later to follow-up but never did. Â I would have expected a bit more from a well-known amusement park such as Sea World. ...For the trouble, time, and scare it cost us you would think they would have comp'd our park fees..."
1602,4/4/2014,5,"Do your own research. Don't rely on one ""documentary"" to persuade you from not understanding what SeaWorld does for not only the animals here but also in the wild with their conservation programs. This place is simply amazing, and believe it or not, the education is much more than kids these days get at school (in terms of animals rights, care, and conservation). Bravo, SeaWorld. Keep up the fantastic work."
1603,5/31/2013,4,"We took the children for the first time to Sea World and they enjoyed it very much. Â Sitting about 4 benches up in their Soak zone, you are guarantee to get drenched. Â Make sure you get the raincoat if you don't want to walk around the park soaking wet and you can use it again on some of the wet rides. Â So very useful.Bella was below the height requirements so she missed out on all the rides :(( Â Max ride the rides and he loved it.Shamu show wasn't as good as I remembered going as a little kid. Â After the tragic accident in Florida, We're not going to see the trainers in the water doing stunts with the whales anymore. Â Sad but true that Safely comes first !!! Â Tickets are getting expensive. Â We got it thru my Mom in law's work for $51. but at the door it's $70 for kids (3-9) and $78 for 10+. Â Or buy it on line, I think you get some percentage off too.Have fun and get wet"
1604,6/3/2014,4,"Sea World is awesome. The trainers take good care of the creatures of the deep. Sea World is expensive,including food, like everywhere you go, but I'm in the military and you get a free pass annually for you and your spouse. The shows are the most fun part. San Diego Sea World is small compared to San Antonio Sea World. San Antonio Sea World is AMAZING. FIVE STARS FOR SAN ANTONIO. EVERYTHING IS BIGGER AND BETTER IN TEXAS. Anyway, Sea World is amazing. Go there, now."
1605,5/13/2010,4,"Shamu!! Oh how I love you.I have a two year pass to this amusement park. And why not since I live so close by. Definitely an expensive place when going the one-day admit pass route. A tip for the locals- during the off season (winter months) prices drop and you can score great deals on a year or two year pass), mine was a little over a hundred and buy one year get second year free.I love coming here on off days when it is not too busy to catch a show and wander around. Clyde and Seymour is my favorite to watch. Love the special exhibits/shows they hold in honor of various holidays. Although summer here is the best as there are the most shows available to go to I do enjoy the winter months as it is also fun to go ice skating inside the park."
1606,8/5/2014,5,"I absolutely LOVE Seaworld and I HATE the fact that they r getting all of the negative attention that they are getting around the stupid Blackfish thing. I posted a pic from there and some of my friends put bad things on my post because of that! Stupid! Seaworld is amazing and they do so much for the environment and animals, they don't deserve it! It didn't do much I don't think to hurt business as the place was packed!"
1607,5/3/2016,1,"I just spoke with customer service and now I'm even more upset. They confirmed that they have heard several complaints about the website overcharging people, I told her then why hasn't it been fixed? Then she tried to back peddle and say it must be an issue with the server, the tablet, the app, the Web browser, so pretty much any way you could make a purchase will cause the site to fraudulently charge you several times. Then the representative said that she would NEVER use the website to make a purchase, that she does not trust her card information online, so even their own staff would not trust their own website. They issued a refund for 2 of the fraudulent purchases and then told me it would take 30 to 60 days for me to get my money back, which is ridiculous. I will never come back, I will complain where ever I can, I already sent in a BBB complaint. I would appreciate for all of the charges to be refunded as soon as possible. Fix your website, retrain your phone staff."
1608,8/28/2006,4,"I had a really good time yesterday. Seriously though I'm one of those people who absolutely HATES going to amusement parks or any of those themed parks for that matter. We only went because of the lil guy but I ended up having a great time.I had no idea that Anheuser Busch owned it and was really surprised there was beer tasting. Okay, okay, so yes I downed a 6ozer as soon as we got into the gates but then I didn't have any more throughout the day until we left.The animals on display were okay, I mean if you've been to a zoo then you're not gonna be all that impressed because you've probably seen it before. But the shows were really cool as they even were able to train CATS to do tricks. For $150 (and previous appointment) you can swim with dolphins (which they have in Hawaii also) or, you can just watch the show. I think the dolphin and whale show was the best one we saw.The food places were also better than I'd expected with everything tasting rather good instead of the usual fast food flavors you get at parks like these. All in all I had a wonderful time, got drenched on the Rapids Ride and my butt was just damp all day long, but hey, it was cool. Next time I'll bring a change of clothing!"

1610,1/2/2011,4,Another fun amusement park in Calif!!!Tips from Queenie: bring ur own disposable raincoat if u planned to go for the water game... coz they are selling $10+ inside the park while u can get them somewhere in ur neighborhood as cheap as 99 cents....
1611,6/14/2014,4,"People say this place is evil. In my opinion, they are hippy liberals just wanting to cause a ruckus. I love sea world and take my kids here all the time. The shows are fantastic and always enjoy a splash from Shamu!"
1612,1/7/2014,2,"For starters I'm morally opposed to keeping large, intelligent sea mammals in small enclosures, but out of curiosity I took the kids for a school field trip. There are now many fun rides and a nice play area, but they've over commercialized all the animal attractions. As you enter or exit each attraction there's a store. The enclosures didn't seem updated since I was there 25 years ago. And the ""Shamu"" show was essentially just splashing the crowd for 10 minutes. The polar bear paced back and forth under 80 degree heat. Sea World seems confused, are they a theme park? An aquarium? Do they even care about animals or simply use them for profit? I will not return until they demonstrate humanity."
1613,2/20/2015,5,"First time in 2 decades and I've returned. The place is amazing, great attractions, great learning experience, and overall great staff. I must say the staff from customer relations, I think his name was Christopher Simpson, anyway he was so helpful, pleasant despite the fact that the park was full and crowded and people where asking questions left and right ( I was one of them) He was polite, concise, and made my experience and my families day amazing there. We need more people like him. I highly recommend this place, the shows were spectacular, especially their Lunar New Year Special, the acrobats were amazing! They not only touched base on China's culture but other Asian Cultures as well. Come enjoy this great place that's doing so much to rehabilitate sea life. 5+++ stars :)"
1614,2/10/2012,1,"I was recently given some free Sea World day passes. Â I hadn't been to Sea World in a really long time, so I was excited to go! Â Geez, I guess as a kid the park seemed a lot bigger than it really is. Â Also, a lot of the exhibits seem really outdated. Â I remember the Shark Encounter and the penguin exhibit being state of the art when they first opened, but now they look way too small for the poor animals! Â This also after staying at the Atlantis Bahamas which has an AMAZING aquarium and shark encounter BTW.Also, the shows are cheesy and boring unless you are younger than 5 years old. Â We saw the dog show and the dogs seemed bored or tired since they weren't following commands. Â Being a dog lover and owner, I would never force my pet to perform tricks all day.Also for calling themselves Sea World, they are trying hard to have other non- marine animal exhibits. Â They had reindeer during the holiday season and a sloth and large capybara. Â Also the dog show mentioned above.They are also trying hard to sell your child a wide eyed cute stuffed orca, penguin, sea lion, etc. Â Luckily, I don't have kids, but i couldn't help but notice every mom roll her eyes in frustration every time their kids went, ""Awwww, mommy look!!!""They are trying to make the park more amusing with rides like the Atlantis, roaring rapids, and a soon to be opening Mantis, but overall I find this park to be overrated. Â I recommend out of towners to save their money and enjoy all of the other beautiful (and free SD attractions).Oh, I also had the most unflavorful, overpriced, and undercooked churro here!"
1615,12/20/2014,5,Im at SeaWorld right now i have an all year pass so ive had many good experiences here i love it here especially Watching Shamu and the dolphins its the best place to take your family my family is here dad mom two little brothers and one little sister awesome day to see all of SeaWorld before the year ends it the best day to come and play in the Snow here i went just an hour ago the snow was fun and they have a little fake house you can throw snowballs at and sledding also make a snow castle and snowmen but be careful its very slippery i almost slipped but it was real fun i suggest YOU GET OUT HERE WHILE THE SNOW IS STILL HERE
1616,9/23/2015,2,"The animal exhibits did not seem well kept this visit- the Penguins could barely be seen through the glass that was all covered with sweat beads of water and scaly- needed to be cleaned. Same with the Otters. Everything seemed depressed -stalls Â closed for food, no more 4D theatre show, it looks like they are hurting - likely from that documentary movie on whales.I even asked one of the workers who said yes, attendance was down. AND VERY EXPENSIVE- $96 a person- which is outrageous really for the little they have. Won;t be back again."
1617,10/10/2014,3,"I don't know why, but when we went there almost everything was closed! Only a few of the stands were open and some of the rides were closed. The only real thing we did was The Sea Lion and Otter show(which was absolutely delightful) and the Manta-Ray! Which made it worth it, but we were out of here before 1pm."
1618,12/20/2011,3,"This place is showing its age. Â Many of the attractions, shows, and rides seem a bit dated. Â Expect to be nickeled and dimed everywhere that you go in the park. Â They even charge you $5 to dry off after getting wet on one of their rides.Based on the advice of other Yelpers, we snuck in our own ""contraband"" food, since Yelpers uniformly say the food here is bad. Â They do inspect bags at the entrance, so do so at your own risk. Â Some people actually managed to bring in huge plastic containers of food.Tip #1: Â The first two weeks in December is a great time to visit almost any theme peak if you want to avoid long lines. Â There was no waiting for any show or ride on the weekend that we visited Sea World in early December. Â Tip #2: Â Avoid the $14 parking fee by continuing north on Ingraham St. past the Sea World entrance and turning left on Dana Landing Road. Â There's ample free parking on the street (watch for tow zones in the parking lots). Â Walk across Ingraham & follow the signs for pedestrian access to Sea World. Â It's a pleasant 10 minute walk."
1619,4/27/2011,4,"Teachers get a FREE 1 year pass this year! Yahooooo!commerce.4adventure.com/â€¦The Tub ride gets you very wet even when you have a poncho on...hehehe.The Atlantis ride just sprays you lightly and gives more of a thrill!The Sea Lion Show was very entertaining for the whole group including a 1 year old, 5 year old, all the way up to mid 30's!"
1620,3/6/2013,5,"Was in San Diego on vacation.It's fabulous!! The park is Â not BIG - it's very manageable. There are tons of shows - you should see then all. [You can get very wet!! Especially at Shamu!] Blue Horizons is great!! They ride the dolphins.There is are amusement park rides, very informative presentations, many animals [marine] are right there!, you can feed sea lions [one waves to you - no lie!], - feed & touch bat rays, etc.It's VERY worth it!!Parking lot is LARGE! Go all day. All your time will go quickly!"
1621,3/28/2015,3,Sea world is always one of my least favorite places to go to but of course we have to go for the dolphin show. That was really fun and well choreographed but make sure to bring a hat because the relentless sun is very overbearing in that big arena. The apes are also pretty great to see. Otherwise I don't care much for sea world and the swarms of people all around. Too busy.
1622,2/18/2015,5,"Had a blast this week with the kids; shows were awesome (even though they seemed heavily girl-oriented), rides were great with a short wait-time and the day went by flying due to all the fun. Definitely a great place to take the family."
1623,1/27/2014,5,"Had to share this letter from my brother to SeaWorld about some above and beyond customer service they received there: To all that were involved and helped us on 1/25/14 we want to thank you for such an incredible experience. As a family we visited the Park to help celebrate our daughters 7th birthday. Her name is Sophie and loves dolphins. KC the trainer kept her promise and allowed Sophie to pet the dolphin and made her feel special on her birthday. We were having a great time when our youngest daughter who is 2 1/2 fell from a bench and hit her head resulting in a cut which bled requiring staff to call for the EMT. Mark the EMT was so kind and cared for our daughter in a professional and heartfelt manner. Thank you Mark! To top it off, the staff from the Shipwreck Reef Cafe when above and beyond to assist us in caring for our little one while Mark the EMT did his thing. Chris and Yessica brought us newly prepared food, and went so far as to give us desserts along with a candle and sang Happy Birthday to our middle girl Sophie. They made sure all of our needs were met. We just want to express our sincere thanks and gratitude to all those involved and want to be sure each individual is recognized by management for such an outstanding job. Sincerely, Kurt, Kathleen, Kaley, Sophie and Gracie"
1624,9/29/2010,5,"Seaworld has changed a lot since my last visit nearly 2 years ago. Â Last time the Sesame street section was still under construction. Â Wow, what a great play area for the kids and a great value add. Â Tip: Â Be sure to do all the ""dry"" activities before your kids hit the water play section as some areas request that the kids not be wet upon entering. My son had a blast in the above ground habitrail which was huge. Â He also enjoyed the punching bag section. The area is kept very clean and was a nice break from all the walking. The rides here at this park are a blast. Â  Be prepared to get soaked for sure. Of course, Shamu didnt disappoint with his tricks and spectacular splashing. Â We will come again for the new show next year. The food is overpriced for what you get but still this is an educational and great time for the whole family."
1625,12/27/2010,5,"One of my personal favorite theme parks.Since the accident in Florida the Shamu shows are not as engaging as when the trainers go in the water with the whales and I miss Dine with Shamu!The New Horizons (new dolphin show) is pretty good.I would recommend the dolphin interaction program and wild arctic interaction programs. Â The wild arctic interaction was my favorite. Â You go back stage to see seals, polar bears, walrus and then spend some time in the water with the belugas. Â Our latest trip was on Christmas day and there is a lot of things fenced work (Shamu Close Up, the killer whale gift shop House of Douse, etc.)SeaWorld is worth the trip! Â Hopefully new and exciting things coming in the future with the new owners."
1626,10/31/2012,5,"I enjoy Sea World. I always have. I have been twice for the Halloween Spooktacular and it has always been a fun time. I remember when I was younger you could see just about everything in one day. Not true anymore. It is huge.We got to go see the dolphins at the Rocky Point Preserve (you could leave me here all day as far as I am concerned) and the Sea Lion show is absolutely the best. The dining plan was by far the smartest choice I had 4 kids, and 4 adults in my party. It was worth it. The food was good, not 5 star stellar but good. The rides didn't have long lines and were a good time. I cannot complain about my trip here, it had something for everyone and getting to watch my 2 year old play catch with a dolphin with pretty worth it."
1627,12/28/2016,3,A fun place to take the family once you finally get inside. Â It is a little pricy. Â Parking is TERRIBLE. Â We waited in line for over 1 hour to park. Â Not exagerating. Â Parking is $17. Â Be prepared to walk a long way to the main gate. Â There is no parking lot tram.
1628,4/1/2015,5,"Okay first of all I would like to say thank you to my baby sister for taking me for the first day here. It was amazing. I had so much fun! I have a 2 year pass and I love every time I go with her, we have a blast."
1629,6/10/2012,4,"Get the iPhone app. Â It's invaluable to plan the day. Â It will drain your battery though so be prepared for that. Â I had 5% battery left by 11pm when we left the park.Saw every show, rode Manta 4 times at night after the fireworks. Â Manta is really great. Â Most of the shows are great esp the dolphins and the two Shamu shows. Â The Arctic explorer ride was a bit lame after seeing a similar one at Disneyland. Â The 4D show was also quite bad.Had a great time even though our Dine with Shamu experience left much to be desired.Bottomline: Kids had a blast, was a nice leisurely paced day. Â Had a great time."
1630,6/23/2010,5,"Haha yes, I am indeed writing a review for SeaWorld because I must tell the world how amazing their Dolphin Interaction Program is! It's an out-of-the-world experience (at least for someone that loves dolphins as much as I do) as they let you play with them and train them for a good 30ish minutes! The shows are interesting too and the other exhibits are okay - but really, I would go back just for the dolphin interaction program!!"
1631,6/5/2012,5,"I'm actually quite sad that so many of my friends aren't interested or don't like SeaWorld. Â It's great fun, because it's not a place where you fall into lines and lines and lines to ride something, although that can happen if you're here for that.Since I was a kid, I always liked the shows, especially the older dolphin show. Â However, they've since lost some of their appeal. Â Maybe it's because I'm older? Â Or maybe because it's stuff I've seen before. Â Actually, those two excuses go hand in hand, don't they? Â Irregardless, they're still fun to watch, but I will admit that the new Blue Horizons (Dolphin and Bird) and One World (Shamu) is a bit too...cheesy?That said, I found myself having fun watching the Pets Rule show...only because it was a surprise for me that SeaWorld had so many different land animals, and the stage is so much closer that you'll be surprised how close those ostrich come.Anyway, what gets me still anxious to go to SeaWorld is the aquariums. Â They're still fun and interesting, even if they are really old. Â I particularly like the two salt-water aquariums, but the newest Turtle exhibit really shines. Â It's brand new, so the tanks are huge and deep -- it really feels like the animals are much more comfortable in there, and instead of small tanks, you get this really large viewing tank for even people in the back can (sort of) enjoy.As for Rides, Manta is great. Â The newest ride they have, it's actually quite fun. Â It doesn't seem all that fast when watching from outside, but it's not bad at all for a park catering to animals. Â The wait's not that long, either. Â This was because there's always two cars ready to go, so the line moves quite swiftly.By the way, even if the Fun Pass ($73) sounds like a great deal -- you do get the rest of 2012 for free -- you do still have to pay for parking. Â But, if you buy the silver season pass at the local Costco, it's cheaper than normal ($99 for a year) and you get FREE parking for the length of the term. Â :)"
1632,8/18/2014,4,First trip to Seaworld at the age of 30. Went with some family to take my 2 year old son. We all had a blast. Wish food was a little cheaper and need more activities for the little little kids. Sesame Street area was awesome.
1633,5/16/2013,5,"Love it! Â Obviously perfect for kids. Â I have been taking my daughter here for just about 3 years (and she is turning 3 in 2 weeks). Â Summer is great - water play, sesame street characters, fun rides. Â Winter is awesome too! Â  We LOVE coming here for the Christmas Holiday. Â Two years so far and both have been a blast! Â Especially the SNOW! Â We have season passes and we live 3.5 hrs away. Â LOVE IT!Shamu show is always entertaining as well as the other shows they have. Â This is a perfect place for families!"
1634,4/28/2013,5,"Spent a day at Sea World this weekend and although the price was a little offputting, the experiences were completely worth it! The Shamu shows were amazing, the dolphin show had elements of Cirque Du Soleil, the grounds were spotless and the food was very good with a nice variety. Loved the Manta coaster, the parking wasn't too bad, the penguin, shark and Wild Arctic Encounters were genius and it was all in all one of the better days I've spent in any amusement park.The only complaint I have are the bubble guns. Please Sea World stop selling those things!!! I did not pay to sit and be hit in the face with bubbles while I'm trying to watch a show."
1635,5/17/2014,5,10/10 amusement park! You're not getting the full experience if you don't watch the shamu show. One time outside the gates there were like a hundred crazy weird @ss people protesting sea world because they wanted the animals to be free. I disagree because the animals in sea world get well fed and don't have to worry about being eaten alive in the wild. I bet the killer whales in the wild are mad jelous of shamu
1636,5/9/2012,2,"Maybe I'm just a jaded old man now, but this is not the SeaWorld that I remember as a kid. Â The park seems a lot smaller. Â There were way more snack stands and gift shops than shows and rides. Â The dolphins were no longer impressive to me and Shamu did not kill a trainer. Â It's true perhaps that you can't have your childhood back.Of note, you can see the recession on full display. Â On a weekend, there was almost no wait anywhere and there was clear focus on the Mexican market."
1637,7/18/2014,5,"I have always loved to visit Seaworld and have had a season pass for years. The reason for this review though is that I was walking along the beach at night several weeks ago and as I approached a stranger he said ""watch your step, there is an injured seal here"" I looked down and sure enough there was a seal laying in the sand having difficulty breathing. I looked up the number for seaworld security and called them right away. They called their emergency crew and came out within an hour. They lifted the seal out of the sand and took him right away to the park for a check up. They thanked me and I them. Hopefully the little guy made it"
1638,1/18/2014,5,"Park is clean, Â fun and handles crowds very well. Â  Mix of shows, Â rides and exhibits provides a nice variation of activities. Â  Animals seem happy and well taken care of. Â  And yes, Â I have seen Blackfish. Â  We just bought season passes again and plan on going back several times this year. Â  Thanks Seaworld for providing such a great family friendly attraction."
1639,9/27/2012,5,Amazing place .. I've never in my life has this much fun ...and. The best part I got to see all the cute sea animals I love soo much ... It was one of my best days ever.
1640,12/19/2013,1,"I took my family to Sea World during the thanksgiving holiday. Â We usually have a great time, however, I must caution you that the Christmas Cafe had bugs running inside the saran wrap covering the food that was going to be placed for display. Â Also, we usually get the All Day Dining Pass and eat at the restaurant near the front of the park and encountered very rude employees that were more interested in going home than providing a good experience for the park guests. Â They were only putting out food when the line was long and the park was not scheduled to close for close to an hour.what I find disappointing is that I've contacted Sea World about this and no response."
1641,11/25/2012,4,"3.5 stars. My second time here within the year and I think I'm done with everything I want to see. I'm planning on going a third time with family just so they can see all the Christmas decorations and Christmas themed shows, but once you've been there once, it's pretty much the same thing. Sea World is a smaller themed amusement park as in, you can see mostly everything you want to see within half a day...if you don't go on the rides. Waiting for a ride may take you an hour depending on what kind of day it was. During the summer, I went on Shipwreck Rapids, which is a raft ride, and it took about an hour's wait time. The ride was really fun and we got soaked, which on a hot day, was a nice relief from the heat. There are a bunch of shows and I went to all of them between both trips. Here's a review of all of them. The Shamu Show: One Ocean - This is their day show. Watching Shamu splash everyone was pretty entertaining. It's not quite as entertaining since the trainers aren't allowed to go in the water anymore, but it's a safety reason and I'm all for that. There's a night version of this show with lights, but it's pretty much the same thing. If you are sitting in the soak zone, day or night, you will probably get wet as I found out at night. Blue Horizons - Dolphin show with some birds in it. It's ok. It's nice to see the tricks, but I didn't bother seeing it the second time when I was there. Clyde and Seamore shows - This is my favorite show here. It features two sea lions and a super adorable otter. During the summer, I went to both shows of theirs. They have a day and night show. There's some kind of theme during the day show and during the night show, after you've seen most of the shows at Sea World, they will make fun of all the other shows. Their Christmas one is also cute and when I come back a third time, I'll be sure to see this show again. If you come maybe 15 minutes early (and I suggest you get there earlier if you want a good seat), there's a stage crew guy named Biff who interacts with the audience while you wait for the actual show. He's pretty funny and I just simply love watching him and the actual show. Christmas Tails/Pets Rule - a show for pet lovers. I saw the Christmas version and so I can only go off that. The pets are supposedly shelter adopted and perform tricks that are pretty amazing. There were dogs, cats, pigs, kangaroos, ducks, birds, and ostrich like birds. It's kind of like a dog show, but with a variety of other animals and a theme. Polar Express - This may be a Christmas themed show and I'm not sure what this theatre is during the regular season. It's a 4-D show kind of like the Muppets and a Bug's life show at California Adventures. You will get slightly wet, but really, it's nothing to be worried about. Animal Encounters -Sea otters - sadly the second time I went, they three otters were napping and there was no real interaction. I love sea otters too. So sad. Bat Rays - you can touch them and feed them, but they are slimy. There is a wash station in the area to wash your hands after touching them. Penguins - You see them on an moving walkway and they are pretty adorable. Dolphins - cuteShark Encounter - rather a dreary atmosphere and you're on a moving walkway parts of the time to see the sharks. There's no Great Whites there. Turtle Reef - Lots of turtles, enormous and smaller sized ones.Wild Arctic - there's a ride to get into seeing the beluga whales, walruses, and polar bears (but Â I didn't see any polar bears while I was there). The ride is like Star Tours at Disneyland. Sea Lions - you can feed them and they are hungry. It's amusing to see the interaction between the sea lions. Freshwater Aquarium - we came here and luckily, we were almost in time for the Piranha feeding. It was crazy the way people were piling in. If you can't see anything from where you're standing, just wait until the feeding starts. People will look and leave and more room will be available for you to see. The feeding isn't super quick or anything. It's rather slow and so you'll see what you want in time. All in all, I had fun both times. Third time is probably my last time for a while though."
1642,2/22/2014,5,"Sea World is definitely making improvements. Â They have a roller coaster ride, a skytram ride and more! Â I was pleasantly surprised. Â I love Six Flags, but Sea World is much more family friendly and laid back. Â I love it and will be back. :)"
1643,4/11/2013,4,"I really like SeaWorld. I've always liked marine animals more than other animals and have been going to SeaWorld since I was a little kid. The exhibits focusing on sharks, penguins, and the arctic animals are great and the new manta ray area is nice and still has some semblance to what it was before. The rides are fun too.As for the negatives, SeaWorld is more for kids than anybody else. While the recent rides are nice additions, there's still a lot more that's geared to kids than at similar places. I know mostly families go but there are areas of the park that I haven't been to in years for that reason. There's something a bit off about the place too. i sometimes feel like they're trying to make things work but they just don't. Rides might be shut down, exhibits might not necessarily be fully functional based on whether it's a weekend day during summer or not, and there are times when they're doing stuff to make money but doing it in away that provides inconveniences for the customers.Overall, i really like SeaWorld but can only handle it a few times a year. It's fun and really unique, don't get me wrong, but it's not quite there. I highly suggest a visit and possibly a couple more but not on a constant basis."
1644,12/25/2014,4,"I was blown away by the improvements made by the new ownership and/or CEO of SeaWorld! Â The rotating tower had finally re-opened, there were less shows but all for the better as the animals were so much more energized. Â I was so happy to see these improvements. With all of this positivity, it makes me extremely disheartened to share a horrific incident AND even more, how it was handled. Â On Dec 23rd, we caught the noon Shamu show which was going extremely well until TWO killer whales got stuck in the stage left gate, directly in front of us! Â We all screamed in horror, begging the trainers to open the gate and free the whales! Â It took about 3 long minutes for the gate to be opened. Â As if that wasn't enough, experience a male trainer had the audacity to come out and tell us, ""It's ok, Folks, the whales were just playing."" Â Are you kidding?? Please don't insult my intelligence. Â I couldn't watch the show for another minute. Â I realize that recently firing your CEO was an effort to dramatically reduce animal cruelty so I would think you would take this event very seriously. Â Similar to elevators, I suggest you immediately change those powerful gates to auto open if animals have not cleared the closures. Â I would also demand that your trainers do not blatantly lie to the audience!"
1645,6/23/2015,3,Sea world from what I know rehabilitates the sea animals that have been injured and releases them when they are rehabilitated. I have heard that they have abused animals but have not done the research myself but trust me I will. Which will decipher whether or not my family and I will ever come back so here's from what we've experienced. The dining with shamu was an awesome and very expensive experience. But the kids and I loved it. The swimming with the Dolphins while I was pregnant was the most beautiful experience I have ever had the dolphin would not leave my side and kept playing with me because (he or she) heard the babies heartbeat it was just too adorable and the other participants looked envious of all the attention the Dolphins have my miracle baby. One of my favorite things to do at sea world is to see the magnificent and beautiful Clydesdale Budweiser horses and Dalmatian. The fireworks and shamu show was fun and we loved that they sold hot cocoa for us freezing babies) I have come back to update my review. I have done some research and I do not agree with the way seaworld has captured and kept the marine life in smaller then acceptable tanks. I don't agree with the trainer in Florida being blamed for why she was killed by the whale when these animals are abused and their are no reports of a killer whale harming a human being in the wild.
1646,11/27/2012,3,"2 teenage girls and I...fly in from Denver to San Diego Friday morning. Â OB on Friday, SeaWorld on Saturday. Food wristbands and admission for 3: $300. Soaked on rides:3 times. Â A day at SeaWorld:An experience. Â Rides are OK, we were fortunate that some of the lines were short. Â Shows were fun. Â Would I spend the same money for another day at SeaWorld? Â Not for a while. Â On previous trips, the exhibits attracted as much attention as the rides and shows. Â Not so much any more. Probably the most significant change between last and current visit to SeaWorld:The trainers no longer swim with the whales. Â I get the safety and security and whomever did or did not and whatever should or should not...the shows just did not have their former sparkle."
1647,10/16/2017,4,"Love this park, we visited Legoland after SeaWorld and was wishing I had bought 2 day admission to SeaWorld rather than Legoland. We visited on a Wednesday and it was sooo nice We purchased the all inclusive admission for our family of three and we ate, drank and snacked all day every hour. And they had lots of food choices, healthy and tasty food choices as well as the regular pizza, hamburgers and fries. My favorite interactive thing was the Manta Rays, they come up to you like puppies wanting to be pet right out of the water and you can purchase 5 little fish for $5 to feed them, that was so funso many thing to do and see. I love animals and fish, dolphins, whales, I'm an animal lover. I wanted to stay longer. We will be returning soonMy family really enjoyed it. The price was great for all inclusive, way better value than Legoland. If you don't like big crowds and love animals go visit Seaworld on a Wednesday cuz it was sooo nice."
1648,1/19/2010,4,"By the time I was about 7 years old I had been to Marine World in Vallejo several times. Â This was before it became Six Flags, and the park was still dedicated to marine animals. Â I remember walking under my mom's umbrella (an Asian thing), trying to find some shade in the hot sun. Â I would sit in the first row of the wet zones of all the shows - and immediately regretted doing so for the sea lion show as I did not know as a wee kid that sea lions live in salt water, until it splashed in my mouth. Â And boy did I fall in love with the killer whales.I haven't been back there ever since it became Six Flags. Â I'm not a fan of roller coasters and would rather look at animals. Â So when my boyfriend and I decided to take a super spontaneous and unplanned trip to Southern California, it was the perfect time to visit Seaworld for the killer whales.Admission is pricey - $69 a ticket. Â Also, parking is $14. Â My friend, a student at UCI, helped me get tickets for $55 with her student discount, and they were 2-day admission tickets! Â I have another chance to visit Seaworld for free before the end of the year! Â That's awesome because their new dolphin show will be opening at the end of May 2010.It was hard to be a kid again and sit in the soak zone when you have to worry about your electronics, and especially when your damn boyfriend refuses to get wet. Â My favorite show was the sea lion show - it was very, very funny.My boyfriend finally loosened up for the shipwreck rapids ride - we packed everything in his waterproof backpack and put on a brave face for the 4 little girls we were on the ride with. Â We saw people getting off the ride dry, so we weren't too worried. Â However, we ended up SOAKED from head to toe - thank goodness we brought extra clothes and towels to dry off, and to clean the seagull sh*t that landed on my head. Â Note: beware of seagulls - they are VERY aggressive and there are a LOT of them.The killer whales, dolphins, and beluga whales were beautiful .. I cannot wait to come here again."
1649,9/9/2014,5,"We took my twin daughters here for their 10th birthday. We had bought all of us tickets for the dolphin encounter last year around Thanksgiving. Our daughters had no idea we purchased these tickets and were surprised in May when we got to Sea World. They thought we were only going to Sea World. Of course it is not fun walking all around in the Sun, but that is part of an amusement park and that is something Sea World has no control over. My wife is currently pregnant and could not ride Atlantis so she went over to make sure that our names were on the reservation list for the dolphin encounter. After she confirmed it, we went to the Artic and off to the penguins. My kids did some shopping then we took them to the Dolphin show. After that we stopped at the place we were supposed to check-in at for the encounter and my kids were in heaven! I have never seen them this excited before and I knew we did the right thing by doing this trip. The girls loved the fact that their names were on a locker and they had wet suits for them. I will say I was a little bummed because they no longer sit you down in a class and educate you about dolphins. Instead it is straight to the water. The fours of us were grouped with 2 other kids which was a bummer because one of them, I believe his parents lied about his age) was way too hyper and not following directions. He constantly interrupted the trainer who was trying to explain what we should do or not do and giving us tons of information. We still had a lot of fun and the trainer had told my wife that when she was pregnant she still trained dolphins all the way to her 9th month. My wife was 4 months pregnant at this time and had a lot of fun doing it. We decided that if they offer the same deal at Thanksgiving this year, we will buy the girls the Beluga Whale encounter as a present. After the encounter, we went on to watch some other shows and the kids wanted to play in the kids area. We let them do that and made the day focus on them. We had such a wonderful time and look forward to when we will go back. We live in Los Angeles and making the trip to San Diego is not always easy, but it certainly is fun. We prefer Disneyland because it is so much closer and the kids really love going there. We also have the premium annual pass at Disney. If we lived closer to San Diego we might consider buying Sea World annual passes, but that is something only time will tell."
1650,5/8/2011,4,I was in San Diego for a conference and I stopped at Sea World during a weekday. It's been yrs since I have been here. I had a great time and by the afternoon i had seen everything at the park. The cinnamon popcorn was good.I had tickets for the San Diego zoo but I left those at home:(- great day event for anyone.
1651,7/4/2014,4,Sea World is one of my favorite places to go in Southern California. Â However you need to know what you are getting into here. The good: The animals of course. Love the locations where you can touch and interact with the animals. The sea lion and otter show is very funny and is the best show there. The bad: The price. Every time I go everything is just more expensive. $15.00 to park?!? Ever since the new owners took over it seems like the actual animal part of sea world has taken a back seat to rides and getting more money. Â We went to see the shamu rocks night show and it was lame. Â The most entertaining part was the baby whale swimming around doing his own thing and messing with the performance. Â If you can go during off season. The park is tiny so when it is busy it is very crowed. Overall I will most likely go back. I hope the new owners can turn the current trend around and focus on what this place should be about; learning about and saving the animals.
1652,8/23/2009,5,"SeaWorld at night!We trekked down to SD to finish off our two-fer tickets. Â Got there around 5pm to experience the nighttime shows.Going at night was SO MUCH BETTER!No roasting in the hot sun.Not as crowded.Not too much being bumped by strollers.Very laid back ambiance. Â During my two smoke breaks, we met some very friendly folks from South Africa (loved their accents) & a very hyper New Yorker who we couldn't get away from fast enough!We went to see the Dolphin & Shamu shows.The nighttime versions were much more enjoyable with the added light shows & pyrotechnics. Â More pizazz! Â Add to that all the kiddies waving around their blue $5 light sabers in the stadium. Â The shows were a bit more rock n' roll compared to the kinda cutesy daytime shows.Topped off with Â pretty decent fireworks show at 9:50pm.Very, very enjoyable experience."
1653,7/16/2007,5,"I LOVE DOLPHINS and am absolutely fascinated by all sorts of marine life. After 15 years since my first visit, and since my boyfriend has never been, we decided to take a road trip down to San Diego with some relatives and friends.I swam with dolphins on several occasions in Hawaii, and although I didn't get in the water with these magnificent creatures this time, the Dolphin Encounter was the next best thing (and you don't have to pay an extra $200!) It was the closest the rest of my party had ever been to dolphins, and it was a joy watching them as they pet and fed them (even though a seagull managed to steal a fish).Shipwreck Rapids was a fun ride, and it probably would have been even more fun if the weather had been a little warmer. It was pretty cold the day we went (with on-and-off sunshine and moments of heat), so we decided to get ponchos (which came in very handy). The ride is similar to the rapids rides at Disneyland and Magic Mountain, but with this one, it's a 99% guarantee that you will get hit with water because near the end of the ride where the picture is taken, you go through a waterfall. I'm the type of person that likes to buy these souvenir photos, but I ended up not getting this one because we were all ducked down trying to avoid the water. Oh, well.The only other ride in the park is Journey to Atlantis. This is also a 99% guarantee you'll get wet in this ride, too. The wait was pretty long, but it was fun. There's a big aquarium right next to the ride with these dolphins that look like miniature orcas. I can't remember what they're called, but it was something I have never seen before.We saw most of the animal exhibits: sharks, penguins, fish, and manatees. If you watch Conan, then I'm sure you know about HornyManatee.com. My younger brother urged me to take some pictures of him posing with one of the manatee statues. Maybe you'll see them on Conan.The Cirque de la Mer show was pretty interesting. It doesn't compare to Cirque du Soleil, but some of the performers have amazing abilities.Sea Lions Tonite was, in my opinion, the most entertaining show there. The performers are hilarious, both the animal and the human kind. One would appreciate it more after seeing all the other shows the park has to offer (unfortunately, we didn't get to see them all), since this show is basically a parody of all the other shows.We did also manage to catch Believe and Shamu Rocks. Of course, this was a great show. After all, Shamu is the highlight of Sea World. I enjoyed the Shamu Rocks show more, mainly because they played several popular songs and because of the fireworks display at the end.The tickets we got are good for 2 visits, so for our second visit, I'm hoping we'll get to see the Dolphin Discovery and Wild Arctic.Tips:- If you're going to buy a poncho, purchase them from the vendors you see walking around, and not in any of the stores because the stores charge you tax.- Wear flip-flops, sandals, or any other open-toed shoes, unless you want to walk around in soggy socks and sneakers the whole day. - Bring your own towel, food, and change of clothes.- Bring plastic / zip-lock bags to keep your stuff from getting wet."
1654,12/9/2017,2,"i was not impressed when i went to sea world. Â all of the shows are like one giant infomercial about how they're doing some sort of conservation something or other (without actually giving a s... to real conservation). Â if you look carefully at the facade, you can see stuff that makes it kind of sad. Â and i'm not crazy animal rights nut either! Â but hundreds of fishes in a small tank is not healthy at all. Â or the giant whales and dolphins who are in a tank. Â it's a big place and you can totally spend an entire day there. Â it's definitely kept up, but it just gave off kind of a slimy vibe to me."
1655,4/3/2016,2,Sea World has gotten to be very disappointing. It was my first time back in about 6 years. We took the boys 5 and 2 thinking it would be fun for both and they had a good time. I think they liked the playground the best. It's hard waiting patiently for 20-30 minutes for a show to start. Now the shows have turned into one long political statement about how great Sea World is and they positive impact. I think it's great that they making efforts but turning the shows into boring repetitive talk isn't entertaining. I think the shows should be cancelled all together. It's about time that made the rides free because that's probably what's saving them from having to close down the place. The worst part is how much they charge for everything. Done when did lemons start costing the same price as wine? $18 for Lemonade in a souvenir cup is crazy. The beer is cheaper.
1656,1/3/2014,4,"I went to San Diego SeaWorld for the first time this past Sunday. At first I was shocked at the price - $84 for an un-discounted adult to get in! I didn't want to spend the money and wasn't expecting to be too impressed.The first thing that shocked me was the amount of people that were there. The line for entrance and tickets was very long. Pro tip - use your smartphone to purchase tickets so you don't have to wait in the ticket line.By the end of the day I must say I was very, very impressed. I saw the Orca show, the dolphin show, and went through the shark tank. I arrived at the park late so I didn't have time to do much else.The dolphin show and especially the orca show more than earned my money. I can't believe how they can train these creatures to do this stuff. It is unbelievable. It takes me six months to get my dog to understand he needs to pee outside and these guys have orcas that do backflips and wave to the crowds.This isn't a place I would go very often (maybe once every few years) but I am glad I did and think you would enjoy it also."
1657,9/2/2014,3,"SeaWorld is not, at its core, an ""amusement park."" It is first and foremost an aquarium.. a really big aquarium with a few rides. I went in with Universal/Disney-like expectations, and I was let down. But that's my bad. So you have to understand that it's a lot of ""see & watch"" things, like a zoo or aquarium, as opposed to ""do & ride"" things.The shows (we did 3): -""Blue Horizons"" (dolphins): Excellent show! There was supposed to be some kind of backstory, but I honestly didn't get it at all. A princess or something? Let's be honest.. I'm not there to hear a story. I'm there to see dolphins flip. The interaction with the humans was incredible! My favorite show!-""One Ocean"" (killer whales): The orcas are always magnificent. So big and powerful. They can jump so high, it's majestic! The fact that the trainers are no longer allowed in the water made for a really lame show. The trainers basically just danced on stage..? There was also a really cooky message about being connected by ""one cean"" and ocean conservation. It felt a bit phony because it was so over the top (uh, there's four oceans). -""Pets Rule!"" (dogs, cats, pigs, kangaroos, birds, etc!) Â : This show was really cute. I was amazed they could get the cats to do anything! So fun. It would be *so* helpful for SeaWorld to install some roofs over the audience seating in the stadiums. It wasn't a very hot day (maybe around 78 degrees), but we sat out in the sun and completely baked during those shows. Sweat rolling down everywhere. Some people obnoxiously had their umbrellas up, poking others in the face! Please SeaWorld...shaded shows! I wanted to see 2 other shows, but I was too hot! We stopped and saw a lot of different aquariums. They're all over, and it's almost overwhelming how many there are! Everywhere you turn, there is a body of water with some animal in it for you to check out. -The ""arctic"" place was cool, literally cool! It felt so refreshing. The polar bear was awesome, but his habitat looked really sad. He was pacing back & forth on his log like a bear gone mad. How comfortable is a polar bear in San Diego, anyway? The belugas were incredible! -The penguin viewing area was kind of stanky. Also the glass was foggy so you couldn't see them too well. -Loved the shark encounter!! My 5 year old is a huge shark fanatic. I loved seeing some larger sharks. Normally aquariums just have small leopard sharks. I believe they were sand tigers. -There's a few places where you can touch some sting rays and star fish. -Flamingos, turtles, sea lions, fish.. so many things to look at. Overall I was impressed with the habitats. It was easy to view it all too. Everything offered a great vantage point, even with tons of people there. My 5 yr old was able to see most of the stuff too without needing to be lifted up, so that's nice. Now for the rides. Do NOT come to SeaWorld for just the rides. You'll be sorely disappointed. There are very few of them (only two ""thrill"" rides). The lines are long because everyone's trying to squeeze onto the very few rides. The rides are mismanaged (shipwreck rapids should have the max amt of people in each boat every time- they were sending boats down with only 3 or 4 of the 9 spots filled! no wonder the line was so long). The rides are very short. ""Wild Arctic"" was so horribly done and outdated. Also, the people are really stingy about height requirements. My daughter tried to ride ""Riptide rescue"" and was 44.9999999"" but got turned away for the 45"" requirement. The little girl behind her also got turned away because the lady said the only reason she met the 45"" requirement was because her ponytail was high. Really? We're getting that nitpicky? Give me a break. Some people can only afford this trip once in their lifetime and the kids may never get to come back.. let them ride if they're so, so, so close. The food at SeaWorld was yummy and surprisingly not all that overpriced. We paid $35 for two adult meals, one kids meal, and two drinks. We ate at Calypso BBQ place, and it was delicious BBQ! Besides the food, everything else was outrageously priced, even for amusement park standards. $16 for parking? $25 for a stuffed animal? Give me a break. Everything was a money making ploy. They put Disney to shame with the amount of stuff they were trying to get money for! It was really a turn off. Overall, I feel like we got our money's worth. We paid $50 per ticket for the weekday ticket, so 3 people for $150 felt OK. I would never have paid the $84 per ticket though. I think we'll be back some day, but I'm not dying to go back soon."
1658,11/1/2013,1,"SeaWorld is an absolute drag. If you like to view captive cetaceans, pinnipeds and other sea life, then you might like SeaWorld. If you enjoy being ""entertained"" by these creatures, then you might enjoy SeaWorld. If you enjoy bad food and crowds and over-priced low-quality everything, then SeaWorld might be for you. I found it to be an awful time. Never again for my family."
1659,7/28/2007,4,"My family and I really enjoyed it Â here. Â We were able to see most of the show...We really enjoyed the seals ,Clyde and Seymour ( we saw both of their day and evening show) the stage manager of this show was really talented and very funny ....werent able to see The Shamu rocks and the fireworks show...my husband said that we should have purchase a 2 day ticket b/c there so much to see and do...my daughter and my husband was able to ride the Journey to Atlantis... my son and i just checked out other stuff like the penguin, etc... Â Check the place out!!!"
1660,1/17/2012,3,"It pains me quite a bit to give this place three stars. Â Before Anheuser-Busch sold it to The Blackstone Company in 2009, this place was above and beyond five stars. Â The last time I went, mind you as a Platinum Passport holder for nearly a decade, was shortly after the Sea World trainer was killed in Florida back in early 2010. Â I haven't gone back since. Â I felt the direction of Sea World, which is now known as Sea World Parks & Entertainment, went opposite of what it was intended for. Â That is why I stopped going and cancelled my passport. Â Instead of allowing people to grasp the concept conservation, enjoy learning about the animals, the nostalgia and awe of watching trainers work with the world's top ocean predator... it seems to be geared toward more rides and ""showbiz entertainment"" minus the animals. Â Customer service started to take a dive as well as the food quality too. Â My mom and I were torn watching the Believe show, which was top notch at one point in time until the Florida incident. Â One of the biggest drawing points to me was watching the Shamu show was the bond/relationship between these whales and their trainers. Â Shamu making a huge jump out of the water while the trainer balances on his/her nose; being pushed around to emulate surfing on water... man, those were simply amazing things to watch. Â Now watching very little to no interaction is depressing. Â The general public feeds off of the close relationship of what these trainers had with these magnificent animals, and now, it feels the soul of what drew people into the park is now gone. Â Thank goodness I have a lot of photographs and video of what it used to be. Â The dolphin show in the past was excellent. Â It offered tons of laughs, gave a chance for a family to be part of the show... Â It was awesome. Â Seeing dolphins and pilot whales in one show was amazing. Â I haven't seen the Blue Horizons show as it was still under construction the last time I went. Â From the general consensus, it seems like my suspicion of the ""transition"" from education to entertainment is correct. Â The Pet's Rule show was great. Â Seeing that they use rescue animals and even training cats to do tricks is mind blowing. Â Worth watching! Â The Cirque de la Mer show offered in the summertime is worth viewing too. Â :)The Seal Lion Otter show can be hit or miss, but I LOVED the night version (usually shows up in the summer) as it spoofed off of popular television shows and mocked the other shows in the park. Â The pre-show offers tons of laughs. Â I've seen it back in the day when it was called ""Fools With Tools"" then ""Deep Deep Trouble"" and such. Â Loved the infamous ""Tiny"" that usually shows up near the end of the shows. Â One of my fondest memories was doing the tours (BTS, Wild Arctic, Penguin Encounter), the Beluga Whale interaction, Dine With Shamu, feeding the dolphins, laughing my head off at the seal lions barking for the fish and visiting the Clydesdale Hamlet (which is now gone when Anheuser-Busch pulled out). Â You name it, I've pretty much done it. Â I loved this place and it's unfortunate that most of its shining moments has come to an end. Â Until I see change in the right direction back to how it used to be, I won't be coming back. Â A Disneyland passport and a membership to the San Diego Zoological Society are keeping me happy now. Â I will say that the place is definitely worth a shot, but not at a full admission price and don't expect so much value in return."
1661,12/27/2011,4,"We recently went to SeaWorld and had a So Cal City pass, so we did not have to wait in line for tickets and just basically walked right in. We payed the extra $5 ($19 total) for closer parking, which was great because it's right at the front of the park. Â When you're tired at the end of the day and do not want to walk anymore, your car is right there as you exit.We didn't go on any of the rides at the park because it was too cold for us to get wet. We learned our lesson a few days before at Splash Mountain in Disneyland where we got totally soaked. Â We walked around the park to see what was around. Â I love love loved the penguin exhibit. Â It's so cool to see all the different kind of species there are and see them swim, run, chase each other, and just hang out. Â We sat down a good 20 min just to watch them. Â I think my bf did this to keep me happy since he knows I love penguins sooooo much!!In the morning, it wasn't too crowded, we didn't have to wait long to see any animal or fish or turtle, or shark etc. People would look, and then move along. Â Anytime there was a kid trying to see, I would just move aside and let them see, it's not hard to see over a 4 y/o head since they're so much smaller then I am. Â But parents should watch out for really pushy people and rude people. Â I witnessed a guy shove his way up in front of a group of kids to see the killer whales up close. I wanted to slap him for being rude, but his gf yelled at him.We watched the dolphin show, seal show, and killer whale show. Â All three where great and of course, we stayed away from the splash zones. Â I did have a good laugh at all the people who got wet though. Â Those whales can make some big waved and splash super far. Â If you do not want to get wet, stay away from the ""splash zones""The food there was decent, like any park it's a little expensive. Â We had sandwiches that came with potato salad and I ordered a soda. Â It was about $24 for the both of us. Â And my bf went and got a beer with a cup he could take home. I think that was $8. Â And they had a huge variety of beer also.If you want to get souvenirs to take home, this park isn't too expensive. (not like Disneyland) I got two shirts and a stuffed. The shirts where $20 each and the animal was $13. Â My bf got a shot glass for $7. Â Not too shabby.We had a very fun day and enjoyed ourselves."
1662,5/24/2012,3,"After waiting months for the construction of Manta to be complete, and holding onto my Platinum Passes for an extra 9 months in anticipation of the ride, I was completely disappointed. About 8 months ago I tried the test seat and was told I wouldn't have a problem riding the Manta, as I am a larger man, and this has been an issue on other roller coasters. Today I waited in line for over an hour an a half in excitement to finally get to ride the Manta, only to be denied the thrill when the lap bar wouldn't close enough for the ride to allow me to ride. I am quite disappointed in Sea World San Diego, that there is no warning that larger people will not be able to ride. I have been able to ride many roller coasters, including California Screaming at Disney's California Adventure, with no problem, yet I am not able to ride the Manta."
1663,10/30/2011,1,"Sea world has turned into a noneducational, crappy amusement park, with sad looking animals. Â As a child, I went to Sea World a few times. Â I remember it having excellent shows with knowledgeable trainers who incorporated educational information about the animals into each show. Â I remember a clean environment that was focused on teaching children about wildlife conservation and protection of species. Â Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Â Sea World has turned into a 2nd rate zoo that is 1/2 carnival. Â When my kids were asked what they liked most about Sea World there answer was ""The rides and the gift shops!""Our kids were excited to go to Sea World. Â They walked into Sea World ready for all their questions to be answered. Â They were excited to find out all they could about their favorite animals, ex: Dolphins, Whales, Sharks, polar bears, and penguins. Â Instead of learning about these animals, they were bombarded with gift shops around every corner and carnival games on every pathway. Â They wanted to get their picture taken with the woman dressed up like a mermaid and they wanted to ride the numerous rides around the park. Â FAIL SEA WORLD! Â My kids came for education and adventure, and they ended up being sucked into your carnival games and rides.I wish I would have read reviews before I went. Â One review I read (after our trip) said it was under new ownership. Â I don't know that for a fact, but I do know that something horrible has happened to cause such a drastic change in the quality of this place. Â At $60-$70 a ticket, I would think twice. Â SEA WORLD ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE, AND IT ISN'T WORTH THE $."
1664,4/23/2013,4,"Good place to take family. Lots of animals..dolphins, whales, sharks, penguins. Kids love to get wet and play with water so it's a fun place for them. For teenagers/young adults, this place is ok. If you're looking for thrill rides, you better look somewhere else. They only have 2 thrill rides: Manta and Journey to Atlantis. Manta was new and it's a nice addition. The highlight of this park is the shamu show. However, I feel like the show has been downgraded since the last time I was here 4 years ago. The trainers are no longer allowed to be in the water with the whales. So they're mostly just watch them from the side and instruct them to do tricks (jump, shake flippers, splash water...which kids seem to love). But I feel like the old shamu show was better. The park is actually kinda small, and you can definitely do everything in 1 day on a not-so-crowded day. I thought the $78 ticket price was kinda steep but then it's buy one and get the rest of the year free...so not too bad.If you decide to go, try to go on a sunny/hot day. A lot of the rides/shows will get you wet, so if you go on a cloudy/cold day, you'll be cold for the rest of the day unless you bring a change of clothes. They have a human size dryer machine that blows hot air at you but you have to pay $5 for it and it doesn't completely dry you.I didn't try the food so I can't comment on them. Overall, it's a fun place to see all the sea creatures and all the different animals. If you have never been here and you're in the area, definitely check it out."
1665,12/26/2014,5,"Sea World is a wonderful place for the entire family to learn about some amazing sea creatures! The park has recently undergone some major improvements and the staff is great, but our favorite time of year is Christmas. The park has some awesome holiday decorations and is a must see at night. They have some special evening shows all dedicated to the true meaning of Christmas and it was a blessing to see an amusement park display so much Christmas cheer. Thanks Sea world for keeping it real we are grateful you are here in SD."
1666,2/20/2014,4,"I came for the pure nostalgia and 'cuz my bf never been. Â From what I remember Seaworld now seems more ""amusement park"" than before. Â It never used to be that way I thought. Â Rollercoasters? Weird. Â Shows with flying acrobatic dancers? Weirder. Â But fun jumps and such from animals...same...kinda. Â I guess after the Blackfish documentary trainers can't be in the water with the animals...which sucks. Â My fav part as a kid was when they would jump in with the whales and jump way up high out of the water. Â So...it's just the animals doing tricks and getting people wet...eh. Â Overall still good..bonus I can walk around the park with a beer...a Stone IPA at that."
1667,12/6/2011,1,"RAGING pissed. I'm a passholder who came to Sea World today to let my daughter enjoy a little elmo in the Bay of Play and Sesame Street 4D Show. Â  Of course with small children, we had many delays getting to sea world and missed the 2:15pm showing by just a few minutes :(So we played and waited around for 2 hours until the 4pm show. Â It was freezing cold, but my daughter was so excited to see Elmo's 4D show we could not leave. Â Finally we approached the theater to see a group of employees. Â Apparently, they canceled the 4pm showing but did not take it off their map & schedule (which is printed daily). Â A manager even told me I was mistaken, until he looked at his own schedule then apologized but pretty much said ""Too Bad So Sad"" Â Boo!And to think I was actually considering upgrading my pass today because the parking attendant talked me into it... think ill just join my friends' SD Zoo pass train next year and renew my Disneyland pass. Â Amazeballs - at least i could bring her to the bay of play to point out elmo a few times and make her forget about the 4D showBummer - Making moms wait with cranky babies in the cold for shows that are not happening is MEAN."
1668,6/1/2017,2,"We usually like Sea World. We have had passes for 5 years but after todays experience we will not be renewing them. Today we arrived before park opening to experience the new land and we were told that all of the attractions in the new area were supposed to be open today. It also does not say that anything other than the polar bears are closed today both at the parking lot and on the offical site. We went streight to the submarine ride and the employee says ""we are not open yet"". I said ""ok"" Â and stepped to the side to wait with my family. Â Then she says very annoyed ""we are not opening today"". So why not just say that to begin with. Then we went on anothrr two rides in that area. The employees in the new area were extremely rude unlike the usual friendly employees at the park. At the octopus ride my husband, myself and my toddler went to go on it. The employee said that we had to wait for the next one, Â ok no big deal. Then when it came time for us to load onto the ride she asks how many? I told her 3, she says are 2 adults? I said yes, which was obvious when we walked up but anyway. Then she said are both adults planning to ride? Let me see we were all waiting in line.. Â anyway she said she would have to split us up into 2 ride cars. Then my husband said nevermind i will just wait. Then she said u had to take the baby harness of my baby to ride. So she told me to go get on the green car. I took my toddler and we got on then she comes by and says no you have to ride in the back. Ok how am i supposed to know this? She should have said that to begin with. Now i had to climb out and move to the back and move my toddler while she waited there impatiently. Â The rides had greese on them so now our clothes are ruined. I would not suggest this part of the park to anyone ever, it sucks. I am so annoyed at the way we were treated that I am writing this as I stand here at Sea World."
1669,7/17/2015,4,"If this review was based solely on my visit from Wednesday it would be a 5 star rating. Went back today for the 2nd visit on our 2 day passes and it was so very crowded compared to Wednesday. The price of the food is extremely high for the quality. They have all day food passes I've used before, but not with it unless you plan on eating 3 means. A person can get a decent meal for around $15-$20. Good idea to bring your own water or drinks too, that saves a bunch. Loved the sea lion show show and the pets rule show. Shamu show fills up fast do get there early if you want soak zone seats, and be prepared to get drenched!"
1670,6/19/2009,4,"I had many reasons for coming here, a to do list of sorts for exploring the amazing world of the seas. My first reason: I just had to see one of those killer whales up close. Â And they are incredible! Â To think that in the wild they are ravenous, sea lion gobbling eating machines, and here they are tame show ponies. Â A fascinating dichotomy. Â At the whim of their master's command, they will swim backwards just to get those tender morsels in the bucket.The park itself is wonderful, as there is life everywhere. Â Not just in the habitats, but walking or flying freely though the park. Â Even in the habitats with the sea lions, you can spy curious sea faring birds trying to get a piece of the action.Second Reason: The Rocky Point Preserve, where you can feed dolphins. Â I love these intelligently beautiful creatures.Third Reason: Â The Atlantis water ride, an aquatic roller coaster, situated next to the dolphin aquarium, where you can watch them swimming below the water.Fourth Reason: The aquarium de la mar, where gorgeous saltwater echosystems abounded, and I found nemo.I have to admit that the highlight of this visit had nothing to do with sea creatures, not in the least. Â It was the Budweiser hospitality center located in the park. Â Here I feasted on bratwurst with sauerkraut, after enjoying a very happy round of beer tasting. Â They had some exciting products like orange and lime beer, or pomegranate and grapefruit enhanced beers. Â Even stouts and energy beers were there for the tasting. Â I know there is a limit to how much one person can sample, but I believe I hit every bartender so that I could try everything twice! Â Family and adult fun abound here.Something I recommend you try is ""Dining with Shamu.""Overall, with its conservation efforts and beautiful habitats, it is worth spending the $65 for the admission price. Â Always look online, because they often have two for one specials, or adults at kid prices. Â But, expect to splurge here because that $65 does not feed you or your kids, or the dolphins."
1671,11/8/2007,5,"I absolutely loved Sea World. It was a great place to take my girlfriend for a riveting weekend afternoon. The aquarium near the end of the adventure was great. The Shamu show was breathtaking... and this place isn't even my style. But to see the poetry in motion of the whales and their trainers was something definitely worth the $60 admission. The dolphin show was cool as well with the bottle-noses doing tricks, and there was a cool R.L. Stine short movie that is better suited for kids.Altogether, this is a must-see if you're in the San Diego area."
1672,7/4/2014,5,"If you're military you get in for free, so I would suggest that if you're ever in the area to come on down. It's worth it whether you're looking to have a good time or waste some time before you go to a fancy dinner place downtown. (Eddie V's hint hint...)Anyways something that's really worth the [$()$][$()$][$()$] [$()$][$()$][$()$] [$()$][$()$][$()$] [$()$][$()$][$()$] [$()$][$()$][$()$] [$()$][$()$][$()$] if you want that little bit extra is the dolphin interaction program letting you get up close and personal with them and also learns little but about their crazy personalities! We had Dotty a very kind dolphin who had over come some life threatening medical issues. It was also fun getting to swim with her. Go and have some good old family fun and I hope you enjoy your time there because the shows are worth it if anything else. Bring your own camera to take your own photos because I wouldn't recommend paying for the ones they take, prices there are a total rip off but what park DOESN'T have outrageous prices for all memorabilia and souvenirs. Also make sure that you eat a big meal before you go to cut down on food costs. Yes I'm going tonight because of the fireworks!!!!!!BOO-YAH!!!!"
1673,5/12/2014,1,Attention San Diego moms! My sons annual pass did not scan on our second visit and there is NO pass line!!! We are standing out in the heat with no shade and a baby in the long tourist ticket line for an hour. I spoke with two customer reps and they said there is NO other option. We will not be renewing our passes!!!
1674,7/12/2014,5,I live right by Sea World and I have a silver pass. I enjoy my time I spend there and also with how nice the employees are!!!
1675,6/1/2016,3,"Knowing that Seaworld had animals that can't be viewed in most areas, we decided to make the trip for our toddler. Â Like the rest of America, we saw the blackfish documentary and have some ill feelings toward Seaworld. Â The park actually felt sad. Â You could tell that the park is suffering after that documentary because it wasn't very busy on a Friday of a holiday weekend and many of restaurants and snack bars were closed. Â Throughout the park all you could hear was Seaworld employees talking about everything Seaworld does for animals. Â All of the exhibits were very nice and we really enjoyed seeing all the animals. Â  Â The shows were great, but they were all very crowded and you had to get there pretty early to get a good seat. For little kids, they had the Sesame Street Bay of Play that contained unique playgrounds, a splash pad, a few rides, and an opportunity to meet Sesame Street characters. Â This area was very nice for kids. Â All in all, we had a very nice day at Seaworld and felt that the ticket prices were fair. Â If Seaworld wants to stay in business, they need to work on making the the atmosphere feel more positive and energetic."
1676,5/13/2012,4,"Came here on the last day we were in SD. It was a Monday so we were lucky that there weren't huge lines. I think if there had been huge lines, I wouldn't haven't been so happy with my experience. We saw a whole bunch of animals, including non-aquatic ones. The first one we came across was actually a porcupine! It was actually super cute and apparently they're more like dogs and you can actually train them! We attended the sea lion and the dolphin/whale show. Definitely go for the shows! We missed the Shamu show b/c of our flight time, but were able to check them out doing tricks in their tank. Overall, a fun trip, cool variety of animals, and I'm glad I had the chance to go. Tix were $73/pp. I think one time was good for a while, but I wouldn't mind coming back at all. It's rare that you get to see so many different animals all in one spot. I imagine it can get quite packed on the weekends, so go on a weekday if you can manage."
1677,7/1/2008,3,"Let me just say I really, really enjoyed their ""Shamu Rocks!"" show. The whole stadium was prepped with mainstream rock songs like Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts' ""I Love Rock N' Roll"". Everyone from toddlers to adults stomped their feet to the beat and I raised my fist in concurrence.The images splashed on their four hi-def screens were very colorful and vibrant. And of course, let us not forget the darling killer whales. It just amazes me how smart they are and how capable they are of doing all those tricks. I have to admit, though - I kinda felt bad watching them. I'm sure it's some form of exploitation, but...oh well. All throughout I felt like I was watching that ""Free Willzyx"" episode on South Park. I also liked the Arctic exhibit and the simulated ride. It was like stepping into a different world. And was that real ice on the wall?Only had the chance to try the Skyride and Shipwreck Rapids. Both were really fun. I got soaked in the latter. Remember to pack a change of clothes if going on this ride.In any case, Seaworld felt kinda old and outdated. But the darling animals are what keeps this theme park going."
1678,1/24/2016,1,"This place is even worst than you expect it to be!!! The only good thing was the rides. Not even all of them the wet ride was terrible! I would never go on it again. The shark,penguin,sea lion,dolphin,killer whale, and manta ray exhibits were all way to crowded and small for the animals. They looked very unhappy and sad. I would never come back here ever again. Don't waste your money here. They should change the name to whale prison."
1679,7/9/2008,4,"I was excited for this, my second trip to Sea World. You see, I LOVE a good amusement park. Always have. My friends give me an awful time when I mention Sea World. Some have referred to it as ""Sea Hole"", whatever that means.. I have to admit I again had a good time! I just don't get all the ""locals"" who dis on it. Is it Disney World? No. But I don't think it tries to be. I am very pleased that there are still so many animal attractions. Up north our Marine World had almost NO animals the last time we went, and the roller-coasters had quadrupled. Sad. Sea World at least has maintained it's roots a bit better... The shows themselves are entertaining. The displays are beautiful in some areas, and I more than once had to pry my partner out of various animal attractions. (He could stare at fish swimming *for hours*) It is a perfect day-trip... especially for us locals that are 5 minutes away! I would not recommend making it your number one destination in San Diego tho. The zoo is better for that. But should you have a chance to do a day at Sea World, go for it!"
1680,8/23/2014,4,"It was my first time here. Sad considering I've lived in socal my whole life! What can I say I had a fantastic time. The explorers reef was one of my favorites. Something about those cleaner fish kept me coming back. The penguin exhibit, the wild article with polar bears and beluga whales! I will say that rays are my favorite and I spent a lot of time at the ray petting tsnk. They were amazing! That night we opted for the dining with shamu package. Buffet style and it was pretty good. The show was informative and entertaining. I can't wait to go back!"
1681,11/20/2016,5,Every time we go we have an amazing time. The staff and attractions are great. You can truly tell they try 100% to make the park feel and look spectacular.
1682,7/22/2010,5,"I love SEA WORLD!!! I love spending the day watching shows and looking at different marine animals.My favorite whales to see at Sea World are the Belugas. I love that whole section, the Wild Arctic. The walruses are super cute and fun to watch. The penguins are adorable! I loved the manatees!!! I could watch them for hours! Sea World took them out though. Which is a bummer! They said Florida has them now. I miss the manatees :(The Pets Rule show is cute!!! I loved how well trained each of the animal was, especially the cats! Cats are so hard to train!The Blue Horizons show was fun to watch! Dolphins and acrobatics makes it interesting!Both Sea Lions Live and Sea Lions Tonite are hilarious!!! Some of my favorite shows there. They both gave me a good laugh!I love the Cirque de la Mer show! It was funny and kept me entertained the whole time. Love it!The Shamu Believe show is cool. The killer whales are gorgeous!I love the touch pools with the rays and dolphins. Feeding them was fun! The water in the rays pool is super cold though! Still, it was a really fun experience!I love the all day dining pass. It is worth it if you're there for the whole day. It includes your entree, side or dessert, and a beverage. It was nice not having to pay each time. So I really love Sea world. Just wished they'd bring back the manatees. I really hope they do!"
1683,6/5/2016,2,"Very disappointed. Â They said they do not offer a Veteran Discount yet at the end of the day during the Shamu show they told the audience the they let current and past military free admission to thank them and ask them to stand to honor them. Â We asked when we got there and we're told they did not have the discount at this time. Â The girl helping us said ""Maybe in August"". Â Then we go to pay and it's Â $89 per person. Â We thought it was $69. Â The girl said ""Oh that's for online purchases only"" they couldn't even extend that discount for a retired veteran. Â Then we buy souvenirs at the Shamu gift shop and they do not provide you with a bag. Â You must purchase a bag or not get one. Â I mean it's only 10 cents but it's the principle. Â You want people to buy souvenirs but won't give them anything to carry it in. Â We have been to several parks and I have never had to pay for a bag and a Veteran was always recognized. Â Knotts Berry Farm is an excellent example. Â We got free parking and admission. Â Not that that much generosity is expected but don't go announcing to your main show audience that you give veterans free admission when it is a FLAT OUT LIE."
1684,11/15/2012,3,"A classic for children but for adults it is ok.The shows have gotten really lame from what I remember. The shows are very focused on saving the ocean and the earth and it is not that fun. The dolphin show seemed like a human show featuring dolphins. Although the shows lack, it is a classic date spot and an aquarium for kids."
1685,8/23/2014,5,"I have been coming here for the last 10 years and the new entrance is really good!! Â Lots of interaction for the kids and kids at heart. Â If you are local, get the season pass you can go for a few hours and enjoy all of the hidden places. Â  TIP: Teachers can get a free season pass. Â Check it out!!"
1686,12/16/2014,5,SeaWorld is the happiest place on earth and with good customer service and satisfaction. I recently went there and had a blast. that is until a bird from the park pooped on my wife's arm. It was kinda funny but things happen. I know its something that you cant really be prevented. Â I just happen to be walking next to a manager (Herber) and was joking to him about what happen when he smiled and offered some compensation. I said to him that its no problem and he insisted that he would do a little something for our unfortunate situation. I truly do appreciate his utmost concerns about Â SeaWorlds customer service satisfaction. He is a positive and inspiring asset to SeaWorld. Â Thank you!
1687,5/16/2016,1,"Poor customer service at guest relations. Sea world should inform customers of the option to upgrade pass within 7 days instead of telling customers ""you supposed to ask"". Won't be renewing!!!!"
1688,8/10/2016,5,SEAWORLD is my FAVORITE PLACE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!! I'm 13 right now. And when I grow up I would really love to work there as a killer whale trainer. It's been a dream of mine since I was 3. It's a great place for younger and older ages. The rides are uniquely fun. And the shows are more inspiring than anything in my life. I DEFINITELY reccommend it. Just ignore the protesters. They think they know what they are talking about. But they don't. I STAND WITH SEAWORLD
1689,2/17/2011,4,"Dear Shamu, You will always hold a special place in my heart. Even though your cousin in Flordia is going through some emotional issues right now. I say, let's just forgive and forget. let the show begin it's been much too long since I've seen your beautiful white spots on your face that most people think are your eyes. I hope to see you soon. PS - splash your salty water in my mouth one more time and I'm gonna getcha ;)"
1690,7/27/2015,5,Haven't been here for a long time and just went today and had an amazing time with the fam bam!
1691,5/4/2012,4,"*sigh* memories memories!!This was the family's number one hangout spot for the entire 90's decade. We always had the year pass set. What has always sold me about Seaworld was how personal you can get with trainers and the animals.I remember when the trainers performed in the water with killer whales and kids were actually able to sit on shamu (with the trainer holding you of course). We were also there when the trainers rescued and rehabilitated J.J. the gray whale before releasing her. It was open for the public to see. Those were a few of the reasons why I loved it so much. I understand how/why everything had to change (ex: incidents like the one in Orlando 2010...and not to mention some visitors acting like morons). However, it's still worth going, because there are many wonderful memories to be made here. If you're like me and you like being with animals one on one, I highly recommend the dolphin encounter (where you get to swim with the dolphins in their pool) . I heard there's a beluga whale encounter now too... I would love to try someday :)"
1692,8/8/2009,5,"Went here yesterday and had a great time! Â If you don't want to wind up spending a buttload of money, come equipped with sunscreen, a towel, and bottled water, because the prices for these items at the park are ridiculous.But other than that, the experience is awesome. Â I went with a couple friends and we checked out all the shows and most of the exhibits. Â It's amazing how well trained these animals are and how they interact with their trainers. Â It'll blow your mind, man. Â Don't come here expecting to stay too dry, especially if you're sitting in the front row of one of the whale shows. Â We were in the very front for the Dolphin show and this giant dolphin dude splashed us about 6 times. Â We were annihilated with salt water, but it was still most excellent(it was also really hot out, so it was refreshing). Â I won't ruin too much, but the shows are amazing and the animals are fantastic. Â And what is up with this guy who didn't like the sea lions show? Â Are you kidding me? Â Do you not like laughing or something? Â And to the folk who think the animals should be in the wild, know that most of the animals at this park were BORN there and hence have no idea what the wild is like. Â Parakeets are naturally wild animals in the outback. Â I have two as pets, purchased from breeders. Â If I were to throw them outside, they wouldn't survive five minutes. Â Also, I don't know what goes on behind the scenes, but based on how those animals interacted with the trainers, it's safe to say that they're treated very well.Great fun. Â Can't wait to go back!"
1693,9/9/2014,5,"I loved this place.. Isn't that adventure but still has many things to do.. They opened many new things since 2011.. So I'd definitely go back again every couple of years.. BTW.. THEY HAVE FUN CARD.. you buy it once $89 and you keep going till the end of the year.. Plus, All Day Dining is worth it.. They have great food.. but sometime it gets busy.."
1694,4/29/2012,5,I love animals and I think that Seaworld is one of the best places to find out about animals (specially for kids - SOmetimes I do to pet store to check out hamsters and chinchillas which are good for fur coats - kidding kidding kidding)I like the show but I can recommend to visit this place during cold times - We visited it last summer and it was horrible my skin: shoulders face arms - were red.i love Shamu show - very brave guys who is working with them I like to touch cramp-fishes.I recommend this place to everybody and most of all for kids!
1695,3/26/2012,2,"I think the only things worth coming here for ... is the dippin dots & the ladder game. Waited ages to watch Shamu because we missed the first showing... Â I think the baby sitting in front of me smiling was more entertaining, to be honest.Seaworld needs some new creative directors. It's as if I took a time machine back into the 80s. Couldn't even find it in my heart to buy a souvenir sweater. All of the ones that they had available, were like the ones that dorky kids in elementary school wore two sizes too big - every. single. day. I like the seal show, that was cute. Other than that, spend your money at the ZOO!"
1696,8/20/2014,2,"Was not really exicted to go due to Blackfish but had fond memories as a kid so wanted to take my kids. Seeing the beautiful killer whales was extraordinary, but the human aspect of the show was not impressive on any level (dancing in wetsuits). Â Aside from the play area that did have lots to do for our 2 and 5 year old sons, the rest of the part was simply disappointing, forgettable or too crowded -- on a Monday -- to even attempt to see. Â I would spend valuable vacation time at the Zoo or beach instead of Sea World (and its numerous obnoxious stores)."
1697,7/31/2014,4,"Spent all day at SeaWorld and came away impressed with the service, staff and especially the shows. Â We started the day on the Manta ride, then took some picks on top of Shamu. Â Headed over to check out the dolphin show and hung out in the soak zone. Be aware that the seats live up to its name. Â Hit all the rides in the park except Atlantis broke down so a little disappointed. Â My kids hung out in line for nearly 40 minutes then were turned away. Â Oh well, I suppose better to be safe than sorry. Â All in all, spending the day with Shamu was worth it because we topped it off the evening Killer Whale show topped off by fireworks! Â Nice work Sea World."
1698,10/8/2013,1,"I got the annual pass, big mistake! Â This place seem more like a business then a conservation to better wildlife. Â $15.00 parking, tiny parking space, dirty tanks, overpriced admission and what seemed to be unhappy animals. Â Small tanks with many large whale seem to be the theme of this place. Â I noticed on my last visit that the trainers do not get into the tank with these killer whales, I wonder why? Â If possible, I would rate this place zero stars!"
1699,8/19/2014,2,"Overall: disappointed with what the park had to offer; had higher expectations of attractions and entertainment; really bummed about food options.After visiting Disney, Knott's, Hollywood Studio, Warner Brothers, Wet'n'Wild, OC Fair, etc., I had high expectations for this park. Unfortunately, I was let down after walking through the whole park and feeling empty and bored.PROS: *very clean, organized/set up (lay out)* great customer service at the gates* nice gardens and amenities*ok shows/fun animals*plenty of adult beverages available CONS: * the sea circus was closed * the crepes place was closed; the Mexican food place was closed; the sausage place was closed.... OK...!!* the Starbucks coffee was a joke: got a caramel mochiato without it actually containing any caramel or whipped cream and waited 5 more minutes for an Americano even though to make the mochiato they needed coffee and the Americano requires coffee Â sooo... ??? they couldn't explain what was the hold up* the restrooms were hard to find and, even harder was to find an associate to help us out*the dryers after the ride were $5 for like 3 minutes and did nothing for us*the sea lions show was a bit lame* the food options/variety was laughable... after walking around for 30+minutes looking for something NORMAL and OPEN, we had to settle for chicken tenders and fries... the OC FAIR, the Orange Food Fair, Disney, etc., all had MUCH BETTER FOOD (the price was high but that was expected)WORST: the shows are nice but when there were just 4, we didn't have much to do for the rest of the day except walk around, see the aquarium, eat, walk some more, and go home. For someone traveling to here for a few hours, I was pissed.*10am-7:30pm.... so every other park stays open until 10 or 11... I understand why this park closes so early... there's little to doOVERALL:Nice experience for someone with little children or just to see for one time. After living in the OC area for 5 years, I had to see this park as I'd heard so much hype about it growing up. HOWEVER, I don't think I'll be coming back with so MANY OTHER OPTIONS IN SO CAL."
1700,6/29/2016,4,"Me and my husband haven't been to Sea World in a while and wanted to take our son and my mother to see the shows and ride the rides. Â One thing I definitely recommend IF you want to ride the main rides is to pay an extra $25 for the front of the line pass. Â It saved us so much time (5 minutes versus 45 minutes on each ride) and enabled us to ride all the main rides (Journey to Atlantis 3 times) and see all the shows we wanted to see all in one day. And we arrived at 10:00 and left at 6:00. Â It was a Wednesday, but at the end of June so kids are already out of school and with their families and that made it crowded. Â In my opinion, I wouldn't spend the extra money for the shows reserved seating. There was always a place to sit even though we only arrived about 10 minutes early for each. Â But it was only an extra $5.00, so I don't feel too bad. Â In summary, the front of the line pass is THE WAY TO GO IF you want to ride the main rides AND see most of the shows in one day."
1701,10/16/2011,5,"Just went here with my wife and kids and it was just as good as I remembered from my visits as a child. We saw the sea lion show with Clyde and Seymour, which is always funny; got soaking wet at the Shamu show and enjoyed the dolphins and bird show with some amazing divers and acrobats. My kids enjoyed picking up starfish in the tide pool, penguins are always fun to see and the Arctic Adventure was not only a fun ride, but really made you feel as if you'd gone to the North Pole to see polar bears and ice caves. The kids has a blast at the Sesame Street play area and the kids rides like the teacups and airplanes. My eight-year-old even decided that he was ready to ride a roller coaster, so he and I went on Journey to Atlantis and had a great time.Now that I'm the one paying for the visit, I also appreciated the relative inexpensiveness of the park. If you search online, you can find discount codes for admission. We saved $20 per ticket by using a code I found. Additionally, you can bring in your own food and have a picnic which saves on having to pay for overpriced food and drinks at the park. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices at the souvenir shops throughout the park. SeaWorld is a great family amusement park and a perfect way to spend the day in San Diego."
1702,11/2/2014,1,"Don't expect they will extend any help when you have issue with your ticket . Just feel sorry Â , don't wont care."
1703,3/4/2007,5,"The Park offers a huge variety of shows and entertainment. The new Believe Show is superlative, I really enjoy the polar bears when they are not taking a nap ... they play with a variety of toys that change from day to day. Ice blocks with food treats frozen in and trying to catch one of the many steelhead trout. The 'Pets Rule' show surprises you with well trained cats!!, dogs, pig, doves ...etc, most of them were rescued from pounds.The Dophin show, that also features pilot whales is amazing. During the Summer make sure you see Cirque de la Mer, an acrobatic, aerobatic, water show only the 'Cirque du Solei' folks can put together.Taking advantage of the free 'Fun card' upgrade makes sense if you live in So Cal since it lets you come back for the rest of the year for the daily admission price.The park has an outstanding landscaping lay-out with blooming flowers all year and seasonal decorations throughout the year. It is meticulously clean and well groomed. When they get their new entry turnstiles working it will be th perfect place to spend a day outdoors!Bring a change of clothes for the kids, since they WILL get wet, perhaps for yourself too if you plan to sit in the splash zone or take the ride down the rapids.The various restaurants have decent food at a fair price and you can have a beer with it, since it is owned by Anheuser Busch. If you eat in the hospitality center, you get a couple of beer samples for free.It would be difficult to see all the shows, ride all the rides, and see all the exhibits in one day. If you visit from out of town with kids between ~6 and 16+ they would probably love to spend a second day and take the rides, see the aquariums or shows they missed."
1704,3/8/2008,4,"I grew up in San Diego, so I've been to Sea World 7 times. This place never gets old with new attractions popping up. Recommendations:- Check out the Shamu show, at least once daytime and once in the evening during ""Sea World Holiday Nights."" The Christmas carols sound beautiful. I have yet to watch Shamu on a summer night. That should be fun. Make sure to head to Shamu stadium at least one hour before show time if you want good seats. Don't forget to check out other exhibits, such as the sharks, penguins and dolphins.- Discounts: If you are active duty, a veteran, or a military dependent, take advantage of the lower admission fee. Even better, go on the day when military families have FREE admission. It's happens every November. I'd go to Sea World either because I was a dependent, or a friend works at Sea World. :)- The ""Pets Rule"" show is amazing and cute.- If you're feeling roller coasters, Sea World has ""Journey to Atlantis."" If roller coasters aren't your thing, Shipwreck Rapids is a great ride. My friends say that people who wear raincoats in these rides might as well not ride. That is very true.- Like all park food, Sea World food is pricey..but you MUST order funnel cake here! They're fresh, tasty and worth every penny.Overall, Sea World is both fun and educational."
1705,5/31/2014,2,"Sea World is quite amazing and does some fine work in education in support of marine life and the environment.However, the park's nightly fireworks explosions disturb wildlife, domestic animals, and neighbors in San Diego. Â It's time to get rid of them!"
1706,8/26/2012,3,"Normally I'm not a big fan of marine life and aquariums but then it's my bf's bday and I knew how much he likes sharks and fishes and such so for his birthday I took him here....he hasn't been here since he was 7 or so...and I myself have not been here for like 7 years or so. Cool thing is I got the tickets for a better price because of UCI student discount...if you get the tickets there it's $73, online $63 and for me (UCI discount) $58.....so 15 bucks off is good haha They open at 9am which was great and I was driving from Costa Mesa, so just 1 hour and 26 minute drive...not bad. We got there around 10 and there were a lot of people already. The parking was kind of chaotic because they blocked out certain areas with cones and driving through it made me nervous.They had a few new rides...well I haven't been here for a long time and I don't even remember them having rides when I was there...we went on the Sky-ride but not the new Manta or Journey to Atlantis ride or the Rapid ride though. I don't remember SeaWorld being so small...we saw every exhibit and watched two shows in like 4 hours. I really don't like crowded places...especially when it's full of children and strollers....and some exhibits can get pretty bad....luckily they don't allow strollers in the exhibits or it would be very difficult to move through one. I really liked the Penguin Encounter exhibit...but I didn't get to see the Polar bear in the Wild Arctic exhibit...it was super crowded too.....oh I also liked the helicopter simulator in the Wild Arctic exhibit...it was kind of fun. The other exhibits were okay....the aquariums are like any aquariums you see...to me if you've been to one Aquarium - you pretty much been to all cause they don't change much.The Shamu show was fun .... sat on the top level of the soak zone and got really lucky with not getting wet at all...I can't say that for the other rows though...they were pretty drenched. We were also lucky it wasn't such a hot day...it was overcast until about 2 when we were about to leave. Overall SeaWorld is really only for tourist and children. and as a local - going there once or twice is good enough....don't need to spend that $63 or $73 dollars more than twice in my opinion."
1707,2/17/2015,3,If you have a Go San Diego pass like I did you can skip the long and dreadful line in the front and go straight to the gate to get inside. Â Shamu and the Dolphin shows are highly recommended but skip the Sea Lion and Otter show as that was very cheesy. Â My kids 6 & 3 even complained they wanted to leave before the 20 minutes was over. Â I'm not sure how the acrobatic show is but we passed on the Pet Show because I remembered it being a bit corny too. Â The penguins were good to see as some turtles and sharks. Â My kids loved the Â Sesame area and liked watching the dolphins swim under water.Skip the food! Â It is over priced but if you must get the ribs at Shipwreck Cafe. Â My husbands beef sandwich wasn't good after looking at the fish and chips that looked worse. Â Our strawberries had some soft and molding pieces and the bathroom there has outrageously long lines. Â Refillable soda cups are $18 here.
1708,4/2/2012,5,"How can one have a bad day or be stressed when you get to see the fuzzy polar bears napping in the Wild Arctic, laugh at the Sea Lions begging for food at Pacific Point or get splashed at the Shamu Show?Sea World is our favorite place to go to see and interact with animals. We've been to the zoo and wild animal park and both disappoint by comparison. We have been season ticket holders for 3 years now and love going. We upgraded to the silver because it includes free parking which adds up to a huge savings.Here is a rundown of the shows and animal encounters available at Sea World:Sea Lion Show - always good for some laughs. Clyde and Seymour (and OP the Otter) always put on a good show with the help of their humans. There are special shows during the holidays and Halloween.Shamu Show - what incredible animals and how they can jump! Our favorite is Ulysses - he is the biggest one with the fin flopping over on top. We did the Dinner with Shamu once and not only was it good food, but we learned about the Sea World whales and orcas in general. In the summer they have a special night show to rock music which we prefer to the more mellow daytime show.Penguin Encounter - always a must for me since I have been to Antarctica and seen many of the same types of penguins up close. The display at Sea World does not do justice to how funny and cool these animals are! Make sure to stop outside to see the Magellenic Penguins!Wild Arctic - There are two options to enter - one is a flight simulator, but you can avoid it if you don't want to waste time or get motion sickness or....Once inside, you will see the Beluga whales! Next is the Polar Bear who are sleeping most of the time. This last trip all 3 were awake and active. It was dinner time - about 5:45 PM, so perhaps that was the secret! We spoke with one of the Sea World employees who told us that Charlie is the big one and the two smaller females are Sinja and Snowflake. Also at Wild Arctic is a walrus who is HUGE!!!Blue Horizons Dolphin Show - The new show is pretty cool with the acrobatics, but we feel there is now less of the dolphins, which is what we came to see. We prefer the old show for that purpose although it was pretty cheezy!Pets Rule - Sea World fosters stray dogs, cats and even some geese and now a kangaroo. All of them perform in a cool show about how animals love to play. We always enjoy this show!"
1709,5/7/2008,4,"Sea World is a lovely place. Â Watching the fish is so relaxing and calming. Â If you can go when it's not crowded it's wonderful. Â For a little excitement you can go on one of the rides. Â My youngest likes the Wild Artic ride. Â It's similiar to Star Tours at Disneyland. Â Shipwreck Rapids will cool you off on a hot day. Â Journey to Atlantis is all right. Â My kids would rather watch it come down then actually go on it. Â Unfortuantely, the last time we were there we went on the ride and it scared my youngest. Â It scared him so much that now he's afraid to go to Sea World even though I tell him we won't go on Journey to Atlantis. Â One day though, he'll get over his fear and we'll be back. Â One thing I don't like is they don't let you bring in your own food into the park. Â Their food is pricey and not all that great. Â They do have tables outside of the entrance though and you can eat your own food there."
1710,5/29/2012,4,"Lots to see-Whale, Dolphin and Sea Lion Shows...Elmo 4D Theater Show...Aquariums with Fish, Sting Rays, Huge Turtles, Penguins and Polar Bears, a Few Rides for kids 2 big Rides for Adults...Games... and so much more. Â  I never get tired of seeing the same shows, I've been coming here for years. $73.00 for Adults$65 for children 3-12 years of age Â  Parking- Ugh....$14!!!Yeah the price makes me cringe but here's what's great about Sea World vs. the other amusement parks-- Â you pay this price once and you can show up all year long as many times as you want for FREE, except for parking. Â Yeah Baby! Â You just have to place your thumb print in a screen and your in. Â  I seem to miss every time I visit this place the Dolphin show and I finally caught it this time and was really impressed with the performance that went into this with flying parrots and professional divers in costumes. Â  The biggest attraction is always Shamu and who doesn't want to see a huge whale stand straight up and splash the crap out of everyone in the ""Splash Zone"" area. Â Not to mention the other beautiful flips and leaps these whales do. Â  Â The Sea Lions are adorable, I never get tired of seeing those adorable animals put on a funny performance act. Â  You have to plan ahead when heading out to Sea World, Â look up the times of the shows on their website so you can plan your day accordingly as to when to get there so you don't miss the shows you want to see. Â They have a cute Elmo show in 4D I highly recommend- kids love it. Â Nothing more awesome than seeing your little one in awe over it. Â They also have a huge play climbing structure, bouncing air thingy and games to win prizes. Â They have little kids rides and Â they have two rides for Adults too- Â A Splash water ride and a roller coaster that drops out of the sky...Mountain whatever..same difference it gives you the heart attack your aiming to get. Food wise- I never eat at any of these amusement parks for the obvious reasons...it's food that sits around and it's way over priced. Eat a big meal before arriving is my recommendation.  My only advice to Southern CA residents- avoid this place during tourist season May-September just for your own sanity."
1711,5/9/2014,2,"Had a lot of fun. The Madagascar live show was amazing. Into interacting with the animals a big plus for all the young kids and adults. Only downside of the day was when we got to the Arcade, we played the ring toss and Rojelio the guy in charge of the game did not care when we got a ring until a bottle ignored us and when it was knock off buy a different player he said tough luck. The only employee at this park they need to get reminded that he is here for the tourist and to make sure that they are having a fun time building memories and hoping that they will return. Not a great way to make an impression. To the rest of the staff, Great Job!"
1712,3/24/2014,5,Went here on a Monday and it was awesome! The day was filled with great surprises (50th Anniversary of Sea World San Diego) so they were giving away random prizes and we got chosen for two free Quick Que premier capabilities that got us front of the line for rides and premier seating @ shows. All the pictures we took on rides and photo booths came out great and there was a lot of availabiliity of animal interaction. Food was alright and many of the smaller kiosks and specialty foods were closed. Other than that the rides Manta & Atlantis are great rides with short lines. Great experience this Spring Break!
1713,6/11/2013,3,"Shamu show was the best of the shows. Sat in the soak zone and got a rain poncho. And got drenched. Blue Horizon show - was mostly a Cirque du Soleil type show with acrobats performing more than the dolphins. Of the 25 minute show, I'd say the dolphins were out in the front about 8 minutes. The Sea Lions Live show was good. What I thought was a pre-show warmup was actually the best part of the show. Biff and his CD player were great.The rest of the park was just ok. Loved the polar bears."
1714,6/8/2016,3,"Well considering that they are using gigantic, wild animals for entertainment and profit (lame), the place was actually pretty good. Â The shows are cool but after the big ""Black Fish"" movie (you should see it prior to going to Sea World, just do it) they are now all about rescue and less about ""appearing"" as thought they do it for the money. Â Good luck with that, I'm not buying it. The food was actually really good and clean, not your proverbial amusement park crap, which was way nice. Â The food is expensive (about $45 for a family of 4 to eat) so you should either bring your own food and snacks or plan to eat there twice and for about $15 per adult or child- don't get caught up in the meal plan they offer, we tried to use up what we spent on it and it was nearly impossible. Â If you make a plan to go Monday through Friday you can buy tickets for $50 on the Seaworld website (Regularly $79 each), from a computer or your phone and then you can show them the tickets on your phone (I did this from the parking lot minutes prior to walking in), parking is $16 and the parking lot is pretty decent- get there early, 10-10:30. Â You really won't be able to see all of the shows or see all of the exhibits in one day, no matter how well you plan, so buying the pass where you can come back might be a good idea, although I'm good, I don't need to go back until they have a different agenda. Â Something along the lines of ""Sea World: come see how we help rehabilitate injured wildlife and then RELEASE them back into their natural habitat"" Â Hopefully one day the rest of civilization will realize that keeping wild animals in captivity, for entertainment purposes, is simply not acceptable."
1715,6/27/2009,4,"I haven't been to Sea World in over 20 years, and the wife and son #2 had never been....since we had a day to kill in SD, I surprised them both with a trip there.I HATE paying for parking, but I know, I know, it's kinda norm at these kinda things. Â Parking was easy, and it was a short walk to the ticket counter.Tip - discovered (quite by accident) that Sea World and Southwest are running a promotion through 2009 - 20% off/ticket by showing your Southwest FF card...probably the best deal available.We got there at 1:20, and walked straight into the Shamu show,and got great seats! Â (methinks this is not something you can do on a weekend). Â Well done 25 minute show...truly amazing how the trainers can work with these animals.From there, bought cheap SW food (cough), then wandered around the park. Â We hit all the shows and had an overall great day there.The not so good - so what's up with nickel-and-diming you on the Sky Tower and Sky Tram? Â I mean, come on...you've charged us to get in the park, then $5 more to ride these? Â Geeesh. Â There's a point gone.ALMOST deducted another point on the Artic Adventure. Â A flight simulator (same model used in the Star Wars ride at Disneyland), but using VHS film (I kid you not) looped. Â We're talking 240 rez in a 1080 world, and it showed. Â  It was actually kinda embarrassing. Â That said, after the ride, seeing the polar bears and belugas was pretty cool.Great day, recommended!"
1716,8/7/2012,5,WOW!!! What an awesome day Â it was!! I already booked my next visit there!!! Since I'm an animal lover it was a Â very unique experience for me with this oOpportunity to get a closer look on some of nature's most amazing creatures. Could you believe that the Dolphins encounters we're sold out completely for the next couple of days??? This place is a must see One single thing they could improve is to put some more restrooms around the park.
1717,6/3/2013,2,"You can sure tell Blackstone owns the park now. Everything is up, way up. Admission, concessions and shear thievery, $15 to park ! Â To make matters worse, the shows are even less than they were before. I had been there four times previous under Bud and I can't remember the shows being as short as they were and way to much bs-ing from the cast and less action from the animals, read: filler. If you've never been before it might be worth it but for return trips, forget it. Sadly I think SeaWorlds days are numbered, AB truly cared about the operation.Damn that inbev."
1718,12/2/2011,3,"I have mixed feelings about Sea World. I think the admission price is way too high. Especially in comparison with the San Diego Zoo which has a much wider array of attractions. The ""aquariums"" at Sea World are pretty small and you really only get to see a handful of fish at each one. I'd much rather go to a full blown aquarium.The good part of Sea World is you get the opportunity to see a select few species of sea animals fairly up close. If you're in to dolphins and killer whales, Sea World is for you. If not, it's probably not your thing.The really freaking awesome thing about Sea World is their Dolphin Interaction program. Basically it's a swim with the dolphins thing. You're in the water with the dolphins for about 40 minutes and have the opportunity to hug, kiss, and dance with the dolphins. While there's no real swimming with the dolphins, you do get to grab their dorsal fin and have them pull you 50 feet or so through the water. It was really awesome. There's an additional cost associated with it, and while it's not cheap, it's totally worth it. Though I admit I didn't have to pay for it. My wife got it for me for my birthday. What a great gift! I've always been fascinated with dolphins and will remember this for the rest of my life.That being said, if I hadn't have signed up for the Dolphin Interaction, I'd have to say that Sea World is not worth its admission price."
1719,7/15/2013,1,"Crime is rampant in the Sea World parking lot. Â Do NOT come to this place with any valuables in your car.Our story: we visited SeaWorld during a vacation to San Diego and parked our car in a paid ($15) parking lot adjacent to the park. Â After a few hours at the park, we came back to our car to find that thieves had stolen everything valuable out of the car -- our luggage, a laptop, two iPhones in the glove box, a bag containing cash and miscellaneous items (toiletries, jewelry, shoes, etc). Â  Everything valuable in our car was out of sight and covered with towels and our car (a GM SUV) was locked and the alarm was enabled when we left the car in the parking lot. Â The thieves apparently had a device that disabled the alarm and unlocked the doors - there was no forced entry into the car. Â After discovering the break in, we immediately tracked down the SeaWorld security. Shockingly, the employee didn't even want to come out to our car to take a report -- we had to insist that she accompany us to our car. Â There was absolutely no effort for SeaWorld Security to ""make good"" to us -- not even an ""I'm sorry this happened to you - all your stuff was stolen, we're sorry"". Â Nothing. Before leaving the park, we filed a report with the San Diego police. Â The police officer dispatched told us that this happens in Sea World's parking lot at least 10 times a day, if not more on busy days. Â In fact, while waiting for the San Diego police, another car drove by and reported to the police officer that the car next to them had a smashed window. Â The police told us the Sea World parking lot is well known for these break ins. Â I'm hoping to get the police reports for the SeaWorld parking lot to ascertain how many are reported, but based on our interaction with the officer, it seems to happen very frequently. Â If you google around, you'll find multiple people complaining about this same thing happening to them - luggage stolen, electronics swiped, thousands of dollars worth of valuables taken from them while they were at the park and left their car in a paid parking lot controlled by SeaWorld.An article in the UT San Diego that was published in August 2008 demonstrates that the SeaWorld San Diego parking lot was experiencing repeated similar car break ins five years ago. Â The August 2008 article describes exactly what happened to us -- no forced entry into a GM SUV. Â utsandiego.com/uniontribâ€¦ The article claims that thieves stole $40,000 in personal property from one family's sport utility vehicle while it was parked at SeaWorld. Â It is unacceptable and unfathomable to me that five years later, this sort of theft is still occurring when SeaWorld clearly has been on notice their parking lot is a huge target for thieves and hundreds of thousands of dollars of valuables have been stolen from paying SeaWorld customer's cars. Â Why have they not installed video cameras in their parking lot like the other theme parks to prevent this from happening?? SeaWorld has plainly failed to adequately enhance security for the parking lot -- despite reports of rampant, repeated break ins going on for at least five years, no video cameras have been installed. Â The park has also clearly failed to hire enough security guards to patrol the parking lots to prevent these crimes from happening to customers who pay a lot of money to go to their park. Â Their customers (like us) are paying the price.  On a personal note, the most upsetting thing of all was that SeaWorld security did nothing at all to make us feel better about this unfortunate incident. Â This is primarily a park for children, and it is upsetting to have to explain what happened to children when their luggage is gone, or their favorite toy or blanket has been stolen. Â SeaWorld customers are entitled to a reasonable expectation of security when they pay $15 to park in their parking lot. Â This level of security was not met. Â SeaWorld has done NOTHING to effect change to protect their customers from crime they are completely aware of is happening on their property."

Â Luckily our son is only 2, so he was free-but seriously, how do families do it? Â The place is on the small side--and it felt like we were herded in like cattle, the place was so damned crowded, it was hard to enjoy some of the animals.While we enjoyed the animals, and saw a couple of the shows, who was the genius who decided you had to walk through a flurry of stuffed animals and crappy toys to exit some of the exhibits? Â Well played--my 2 year old screamed that he wanted a toy every time we walked through one. Â But screw you seaworld, I resisted, and my kid is fine with the snake we bought him at the zoo.I guess if you want to come to say you've seen it, go ahead. Â But it was too hot, too crowded, and I wanted to punch the people who kept pushing into me to get a closer look. Â I much rather recommend the San Diego Zoo or the Safari Park (Zoo--FREE PARKING!! Â and it's $10.00 at the Safari Park, but we enjoyed it so much more, so I won't complain)."
1721,9/3/2013,4,"I love sea world. I got to see shamwow last night and it was one of the most exciting part about coming to sea world. The sting ray ride was also very fun, it's definitely worth the wait! Worth a visit, but I wouldn't recommend the season pass!"
1722,10/8/2013,2,"It has been about 5 years since my last visit. Â It's now almost $80 for adults. Many of the shows have become overly ""corny"" as another reviewer wrote. Â A few even have Coca Cola commercials written into the script. Corny and tacky. Does that prevent the ticket from being $90? Â Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the biggest show, Shamu. Video montages that have nothing to do with the show but drag it out making it difficult for younger children to focus. The trainers no longer swim with the whales so it's a lot of ""fringe"" interaction. Most of the shows are sorely over produced to the point of distracting from the talented animals everyone enjoys, especially Blue Horizons. The one exception is Pets Rule! Â That is a great show. Sea World could take lessons from Disney on story telling and production quality. Sea World is obviously trying to compete for the younger audience having done away with the Clydesdales and revamping that area into a children's picnic activity area. The hands on exhibits such as tide pool or manta ray are still fun but you might as well go to a aquarium for that experience. Honestly, for almost $80 you might as well pay a few more dollars and go to Disneyland."
1723,5/9/2010,3,"While on spring break vacation with the kids on April 7, 2010, I decided to take the kids here since they had never been. Â Keep in mind, this was just a few weeks after the Killer Whale killed the trainer.Likes:The shows were good. Â I especially enjoyed the shark experience. Â I also enjoyed the killer whale show. Â The scenery surrounding the park is awesome. Â They planned the location very well. Â They also do really well with the grounds inside the park. Â Very well kept plants and trees. Â I really enjoyed seeing the wide variety of plant life.Dislikes:Food selection sucks. Â I hated the fact that you have to pay this astronomical amount of money to get into the park, then they want to charge you a fee for rides inside the park like the water ride. Â I really hate the fact they serve alcohol inside the park too. Â You know how some folks get with a little booze or buzz. Â Their true, trashy colors come out.The kids had a good time, so that good enough for me. Â A-OK it is."
1724,4/16/2015,3,"I've lived in San Diego for 18 months and just visited Sea World for the first time today. I won't lie, I have seen a certain documentary that casts a pretty negative light on the Marine Park. Needless to say, my expectations weren't very high going into Sea World and I really only ended up going because my Mom had always wanted to go. We arrived and I immediately wanted to head over to the main attraction; Orca Whales. These have long been my favorite Animal and I had only seen them far off the California coast years ago. I was standing on land as a pod of them swam in the ocean about 300 yards off shore. It was remarkable. I am actually thankful that I have that memory, as it was far more majestic and way less saddening then what they have at Sea World. We approached the tank and a feeling of sadness came over me. I don't know how to describe it, as my Mom and many others around me were extremely excited to see these beautiful animals up close for the first time. To put it simply, the Whales just look like they don't belong there. I watched them swim in circles for a few minutes and then asked if we could leave. We did and the next stop was the Dolphin's, which saved Sea World for me.The Dolphins swim and play with each other, trainers and even guests as they dart around their pool. It is far more enjoyable to watch, as many of the Dolphins are having a genuinely good time. I recommend seeing this section of the park.After a ride on the Manta, which is a fantastically themed roller coaster, we headed over to the Shark and Sea Turtle Rescue section. Again, both of these are excellent in their own rights. The Shark exhibit display, including the walk through tunnel is very impressive. I also spent a lot of time watching the Sea Turtles, most of them going crazy as it was feeding time! We then headed to the arctic exhibits (Penguins, Polar Bears, Beluga Whales and a Walrus) which was the highlight of the day. Seeing the Beluga Whales for the first time was truly an awesome experience. To me, these Whales seemed pretty happy in an enclosure that was much much better/more naturally themed than their Orca counterparts. The penguin exhibit was fantastic and at this point, I was having a much better impression of the place. We rode the Atlantis ride, which was one of the best flume rides I have ever been on. We then headed to Shamu Stadium to watch the Orca show -- If I can some this show up, it basically just doesn't belong in this park and in this day and age. The show is about as far as you can get from educational and seems like something out of the 1970's. The whales all look miserable, going through the motions looking for their fish reward. They fire water cannons at the pool and trainers dance and throw fish. Orcas spin and jump and wave and soak the crowd, which sounds like fun but it just wasn't. I didn't clap, I didn't laugh, I honestly didn't know what to do. After the show, we headed to the raft ride and we got absolutely soaked! This was a lot of fun and a really good attraction for a hot day. After checking out the Octopus building and a few other fish exhibits, we headed home. We both really enjoyed coming here and I would recommend it to people who ask. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I can't because for the 75% good things, there was still the other 25% bad, which was anything that had to do with the Orcas Whales. I understand they can't just release these animals back into the wild, but please stop making them perform tricks like they are pet monkey's. If I could give any advice, it would be to release some whales into the stadium and EDUCATE people on these fantastic animals. Build them an enclosure that doesn't look like a motel swimming pool. Do these things and people will stop associating this park with animal cruelty. 75% is a C and C's are average. Go for the A Sea World. The Orcas deserve it and so do we."
1725,5/1/2016,5,"As a first time visitor I really didn't know what to expect, especially after all of the negative press. Â I found myself pleasantly surprised and the ticket price was more than worth it. Â I spent the entire day here and managed to see everything, some things more than once. Â The whole place was zoo meets aquarium with a few rides sprinkled in where I learned a ton and walked a ton. Â While I didn't choose to participate in feeding any of the animals it was interesting to observe others doing so. Â The various animal shows were entertaining and educational, though the orca show was a bit lackluster likely due to the upcoming changes. Â If I had to pick some favorites I'd say the walruses, stingrays, and penguins would be my top choices. Â Another major selling point was the designated stroller parking so that seating, aisles, and views weren't blocked by inconsiderate parents. Â After this fun filled day I can definitely see myself returning here and checking out other locations."
1726,5/13/2010,4,"You definitely have to go to SeaWorld at least once in your lifetime! Â It's definitely a cool place to go, it can get a little old if you go too often, but if you go once in a while it can be a blast!The shows are all awesome, but at the same time that is a downfall of SeaWorld since it isn't a place for the thrill seeker. However they do have a couple of rides for adults and kids if you wanna get wet.My favorite thing about this place is that once a year active duty military and their families get in for free. Â That's a pretty awesome deal. Â They also have deals like if you buy a day, you get the year free, or if you buy a year, you get a year free!Did I mention they have free beer sampling????This is definitely something every San Diegan should see at least once!"
1727,9/7/2010,4,"I guess you can call me an amusement park junkie. Â My husband and I have had annual passes here for 5 or so more years and keep coming back. Â Being a San Diego local, having annual passes to Seaworld is a convenience and a luxury. Â On any nice day it's great to head over to Seaworld to catch a show, play carnival games or just stroll around. I only gave the place 4 stars because a few of my favorite things about the place have changed. Â Since Anheiser-busch got bought out, they no longer offer free beer samplings, beer school or the beer pairing sessions. Â The Clydesdale and donkeys are no longer there and the Manatees that were on exhibition were returned to Miami after the contracted dates Seaworld San Diego had planned. Â Although I like the new theming with Seseme Street and they new 4D show with Elmo... I still miss the Pirate show that was there for so long. My favorite parts of the year are the holidays at Seaworld. Â They do a great job during the Halloween season and give kids candy and have people dressed up. Â Last Christmas they had an ice skating rink. Â They also have different parts of the year dedicated to different groups as well and theme them appropriately... like ""Salute to Heros"" and such."
1728,12/20/2013,1,"Went there last year and was not impressed. Â Food was ridiculously priced and not satisfying. Â The place just seemed run down and the employees (not the trainers) seemed bored. Â We had more fun just doing things in San Diego more than going to the park. Â It was supposed to be the highlight of our trip, but turned out quite the opposite. Â Not returning. Â I've not recommended the place to any of my friends or family."
1729,8/14/2014,5,Sea World is all about the live shows so plan accordingly. Loved the whale performances. View show times online the day before you go and plan an itinerary of which show you will catch and at what time. Arrive 15 minutes before show time to get good seats
1730,7/27/2014,5,Sooo love this place! My little family spent the entire the day there minus lunch time. We got there pretty early and the lines were crazy but we were able to get tickets and get in pretty quickly and found that the facility was clean and the staff for super welcoming. We were actually able to see a lot of shows the exhibits my favorite of course for the the Penguins. I like the fact that they have $0.99 refills on soft drinks if you buy a souvenir Cup. And you can bring it back to your next visit and the refills are still $0.99! The only negative thing was the weather but that's something out of SeaWorld control it was just really hot and I wish some of the arenas where the shows were enclosed so that we wouldn't have to sit in the hot sun. Please bring plenty of water and sunscreen.
1731,9/30/2011,4,"I have been coming to Sea World for years and have always enjoyed it. This review is based on recent trips to Sea World with my boyfriend, now husband (Love!).- Compared to the Sea World of my childhood, Sea World is now a more ride-oriented park. There are several water rides amongst all the marine life- most recently I went on the Journey to Atlantis ride, which is similar to Splash Mountain. The ride was fun, other than the part where it broke down for about 15 minutes and we were stuck waiting at the bottom of the big drop for it to start back up. - As you'll see through their exhibits, Sea World is super active in conservation. They have been involved in many different efforts, including oil spill clean-ups and animal rehabilitations. So at least you know that some of the money from your super-expensive ticket (and outrageous parking) will be going to a good cause, besides you and your family having a great day :) - The animal shows are a lot of fun, especially for kids :) The Shamu show hasn't changed much from the ones I saw as a kid- lots of awesome jumps from the Orcas and trainer-orca tricks. The current dolphin show, Blue Horizons, is more of a human acrobatics shows than a dolphin show- dolphin tricks are only like 30% of the show! Most of it is people in costumes doing tricks and lip-syncing wanna-be Disney songs, haha. **IMPORTANT NOTE- when the sign on the seat row says SOAK ZONE- that means you and your Digital-SLR will get wet. If you don't wanna get wet, DON'T SIT THERE! I swear, every time a splash happens, people scatter like leaves. Like they didn't see this coming. - Several of the animal exhibits, including dolphins, sea lions, and bat rays, have times where you can feed the animals for a little under $10. My favorite is the bat rays- they are so soft and squishy and they all pile on top of each other to get the squids. Sadly, the bat ray exhibit is closed right now because they are building a new ride/exhibit. - On my most recent trip, I had the pleasure of visiting the newest Sea World exhibit, Turtle Reef. Awesome new exhibit!!! There is a large aquarium with many turtles swimming about that has many viewing opening so that you don't have like 30 ppl crowding around a tiny window. There is an interactive map of turtle conservatism efforts worldwide- including TEDs. There is also an interactive video game where you and 3 other players play as turtles swimming to the beach to lay eggs. It is fun for all ages haha. My husband and I are competitive so we had a good time battling it out with each other haha. Luckily there are 2 games, with 4 players, so lots of opportunities for everyone to play :) - Attention Military Families- you get one day a year free :) active-duty military members and up to 4 dependents can get in one day a year for free :)Overall- I really love Sea World! Highly recommend going!!"
1732,10/3/2012,4,Loved Seaworld! great fun and cheap thrills. Loved the Shamu Story and the fact that you could pet the dolphins. Great place to bring the kids and family or even for adults
1733,8/9/2014,5,Thank you Sea World for the free entrance for my family!!! My husband works so hard as a Battalion Chief and has very little free time with our family and to be able to go to Sea World for free was an amazing treat! Â We had a fabulous time! Â He is currently working multiple fires in Northern CA and has been gone 6 days with no date set for when he can come home. Â This is the normal life of a firefighter and his family so we so cherish days that we can be together! Loved the Dolpfin show and new ride.
1734,5/25/2007,3,"Man has this placed aged, and not in a good way. Â Seems to me this park got left in the dark, with regards to updating the facility. Â Rides are dated, and boring, food is meh, at best. Â Shows are getting rather dated and why haven't they been able to keep up with their sister park in Florida?Service/crew members were nice I think that was the only positive of the park, well minus the ridiculous process in which you ""try"" to enter the park. Â Security checks were a joke, these folks need to take a lesson from Disney. Â Speed it up boyz!!!Shamu show was okay, I was glad after all the hype about the ""trainer"" and his whale fluke necklace, that was highlighted in the show, this item, easily found in the souvenir stand near the exit of the show. Â It was cheap, and it's about the cheapest item you can find to take home with you.Florida is WAY better, more shows and better rides. Â This park needs to step it up a bit."
1735,1/12/2010,3,"We really enjoyed our trip. Went in January and it was crowded but not overly so. If I lived down here, I'd buy a season pass just for the kids play area. Â Ton of fun for the toddler. Â Nice that they have a couple of rides (I believe 3) that two year olds can ride and, of course, the scheduled photo shot with Elmo was a highlight.No need to discuss the shows, but Shamu was still a hit as was watching everyone get splashed. Â Hit up the dolphin feeding area early and we were able to pet dolphins no problem, not sure if it was b/c we went early, or if it just wasn't crowded. Â Kid loves petting rays, so there you go. Â We walked by breakfast w/shamu, and at first glance, I don't think that it was worth it, but didn't do it.Really liked the mellow and big manatee exhibit. Actually liked all the big animal exhibits. Â The aquariums are much smaller than long beach, but the exhibits are pretty albeit small. Preferred the ocean exhibit to the fresh water. Â As expected, everything is overpriced and they do have a lot of add-ons for a fee, which is annoying, but I guess the standard. Â We ended up going to the Shipwreck CafÃ©, based on a review below and I believe the reviewer that this may be the best restaurant, but it was still disappointing. Conceptually sounds good, but the salmon had been sitting under a heat lamp & the ribs were dry. Best thing on the menu were the chicken fingers on the kids menu. Â What I am pleased to see about sea world is how easy it is to get brews in spite of Busch selling the park, which reminds me about how sad I am that Busch Gardens is no longer around."
1736,4/21/2012,4,"I love the Shamu Show, the Sea Lion Show (the comedian, Biff the Stage Hand is hilarious with his dance routines based on old movies), the Shark Encounter, the Penguin Experience, and the food was great too.However, the Dolphin Show was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The trainers are Circus de Soleil wannabes. Too many costumed trainers flying through the air and diving into the pools in bird-suits and tights. Not enough dolphins performing. It's like the humans are upstaging the dolphins. Â My granddaughter who loves dolphins was really disappointed. She had more fun and interest watching the dolphins in their holding tanks backstage than watching the performance called ""Blue Horizons."" Â It's like a circus review, with schmalzy water acrobatics, and rope twirling, and diving tricks. I think these trainers or human performers are trying to fulfill some fantasy of being in Las Vegas shows, by stretching the boundaries of sea-park entertainment. I recall with great satisfaction the old dolphin shows of the past, with summer-saulting dolphins, jumping through hoops of fire, and leaping straight up out of the water to grab a mackeral off of a long pole. This is all displaced by some ego-centric performers who put themselves before their animals. Â This is more of a diving show, than a sea-life show."
1737,1/30/2014,3,Umm... Seaworld San Diego. $4 churros and monstrous crowds. Can't say if its geared towards adults or children as it doesn't really appeal specifically to either. The crowds are what killed it for us. Note to self; don't ever come again during a school break.
1738,1/19/2015,5,Amazing Experience there Last Sunday. It was my 2 year olds birthday ....we debated on going because of the rain. Im so glad we still decided to go. We had a group of 8 with us. My son loved everything from feeding the seals to the Shark Encounter. Around 1 pm we got a little lost looking for a nice restaurant to eat at. We were all so hungry and out of nowhere came the nicest sea world staff ever. Madeline and Kathleen directed us to a great eatery within the park. When we got ready to pay they pulled out there badges and gave us their employee discount. It was so nice of them. Then it just got better....as my family and I were eating they came up with a surprise bag full of gifts. It had rain jackets for everybody in my family and some other great sea world gifts. We now are season pass holders and recommend everyone to go. Thank you Sea World for making my sons 2nd Birthday a Success.
1739,7/27/2014,2,"I went with my family yesterday. It's been a while since I last was there. Lots of things have changed. It was super hot. I don't understand why sea world don't invest in tents/ covers, like universal studios (especially that 90% there are shows) Â or misters like disneyland. Tickets are not cheap and surely they have the money for that. Some of the areas smelled like dirty water. The worest area was the shark one. My sister and I couldn't handle the smell. The most famous show ""Shamu"" is shorter now and they didn't even mention Shamu word in the show. The dolphin show was more of people doing acrobats than of a dolphins show. 2 rides were down. Â I am assuming lack of maintenace. I didn't enjoy my time as I thought I would."
1740,10/17/2012,3,"My first show was the dolphin one. It broke down but THANK GOD. they showed us all the tricks and got to know all the dolphins which was pretty good. Nifty tricks. We decided to come back later for the actual show but IT WAS SO LAME. I came to watch DOLPHINS, not trainers in whacky bird costumes doing tricks. The dolphins only did TWO tricks at most. SO disappointing.Shamu -__- The trainers didnt even go in the water at all! Maybe the orcas were acting up and were in killer-mode but it was REALLY disappointing.The sealion show was SO CUTE. Yeah it got messed up a lot but the hosts were great with entertaining. My favorite by far :)Pet show was SO FUN. I loved all the nifty tricks and how the cats turned into white cats after being dipped into ""milk"" haha. Funnel cake was really good BUT dont go to the ""create your own"" really low quality funnel cake there. the BBQ joint was REALLY good. I really loved it there. Def take advantage of the all day dining. So worth it."
1741,9/3/2013,5,"I LOVE SeaWorld. I gotta admit the Shamu show is pretty boring now that the trainers don't get in the water with the whales but everything else is great. I always thought i'd be a trainer at sea world when I grew up and i'm so glad i didn't pursue it bc if I had and then I wasn't allowed to get in the water I'd be pretty bummed. I thought I drastically changed my career plans from Marine biology to psychology but ironically enough now I do behavior modification with humans and not animals but it is the same thing! I love watching the shows and how the trainers can get huge animals to perform with just behavior principles and positive reinforcement. Anyway enough about me. The Sea Lion and Otter show is hilarious. The new ride Manta is great. I liked it better than Atlantis. I like that you can touch a lot of the animals like the dolphins, star fish, rays, etc. Ship wreak Rapids is an oldie but goodie. That ride never gets old. Prepare to get wet but you'll love it in the heat and at least it's not stinky fish salt water. For $79 you pay for a day and come back free all year with only 5 blackout days; you can't beat that!"
1742,11/26/2011,4,"I have been coming here since I was about 6, and have watched this place grow & change to what it is today. I must say, that overall, the additions have been great. The park is always clean, the lines are never excessive and you can typically get a decent seat at all of their shows. The restaurants are typical amusement park type cafeteria food, and your best bet is probably the Shipwreck Cafe. As for the shows, I would definitely suggest (in order) Dolphin Show, Shamu and the Sea Lions. All of them are entertaining, but the Dolphin Show is definitely the best by far. The rides have been a great addition, and really help round out the day when you are tired of looking at sealife. Neither are too scary or fast, and are perfect for all ages. I personally am terrified of roller coasters and did just fine. Definitely a must see for tourists or OOT guests, and locals should all go at least once...it's definitely worth the cost."
1743,9/24/2012,3,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers. The shows were great (we saw the Orca show and the dolphin/bird show) and the dolphin interaction was fun. I wouldn't pay extra to swim with the dolphins since there is a big crown watching while you do it (personally). Unfortunately, I am more used to attractions like Disneyland which gives you a major bang for your buck. Their focus on safeguarding the environment and education was great but Sea World isn't quite the ""overall experience"". Additionally, their food was HORRIBLE. My hamburger didn't taste like anything, literally... no flavor. The funnel fries were pretty tasty (hard to go wrong with sugary friedness). Having never been I was glad to go and we had fun. I won't go out of my way to attend again unfortunately."
1744,3/2/2012,5,"I went here on a date so this review might have a small bias haha.Highlights of the experience were the water rafting ride, the main SeaWorld skyscraper ride, and the Arctic area was also very cool (...literally haha). Â The whales and polar bears were a good attraction as well. Â Although we didn't catch them all, the best show was the Sea Lion show! Â It was one of the night shows and the main guy was hilarious and the Sea Lions were also quite impressive. Â  Overall the experience was great. Â The criticism I would have is that the food/drinks are too expensive (although I think that is to be expected in a theme park atmosphere) and again it is not as mystical of an experience as I remember as a child."
1745,11/28/2011,5,"IT'S FRICKIN' SEAWORLD! Â WOOHOO! Â Still an awesome place to spend the day. Â I get the silver pass every year (actually got a deal on a silver pass that gives 2 years) which offers free parking ($14 per car normally) and discounts on food and gift shop items.Two downers: The new dolphin show is weak. Â I LOVED the old one. Â It was funny and entertaining. Â The new one is too pretentious. Â But......not NEARLY as pretentious as the Shamu show. Â Unfortunately they decided that it was too dangerous for the trainers to be in the water with the whales so some of the best tricks are no longer available. Â They try to make up for it by having more whales in the show at once (which is nice) but doesn't quite do it. Â WAY too much of the show is voiceovers and TV nonsense which I don't need to be there to see.The Sea Lion show is still awesome, as are the dolphin interaction and many of the other exhibits. Â Annual passes are a must!"
1746,4/15/2012,3,"My first and only visit to San Diego's Sea World was a fun experience. Â I had previously been to the old Sea World in Aurora, Ohio many years ago before it closed down. Â I got to pet a dolphin!!!!Other than that, it was a glorified zoo/aquarium. Â We didn't get to go to any of the shows. Â There seemed to be a lot in the morning, and they spuratically throughout the afternoon. Â We got there around noon, and had missed all of the morning shows. Â By the time we were finished walking around, we had missed the mid-afternoon shows, and didn't want to wait 2 hours until the next Shamu show :( Â So, I didn't get to see Shamu. I do feel bad for the animals, but my rating does not reflect my personal opinion of that.The park was very clean. Â Parking was Ok. Â My visit was as expected."
1747,6/6/2011,4,"Ahh, good ole' Seaworld. I don't know if I'm wallowing in pride or swallowing my shame when I admit that I've been to Seaworld more than 20 times. At least I have some sort of merit every time I casually joke around about how many times Shamu has died and been replaced. It's been crazy to see how much this place continues to change.Admission. NEVER EVER pay the full admission price, as there's always a million special offers and deals going on. With a little consumer research, you can easily find a way to pay around 50 dollars per ticket. Heck, even try Ebay for tickets (With caution and research, of course!).Food. Blessed with forgiving taste buds, I'm not a harsh food critic. But something about Seaworld's food just tastes so bland and mass produced... and it's overpriced. Granted that we had the 40 dollars wristband that allowed us to eat all we wanted, the food is just too expensive for that cafeteria nostalgia. There really aren't any other places for fine dining too.SHAMU SHOW. What the hell happened to the show? Yes, I know Shamu killed a trainer not too long ago, but I remember the show to be so much more exciting and long! There's simply no interaction between the hulking mammal and the trainers and the plot felt cheesy. Sure, maybe it's the sheer expectations from my childhood still lingering in me, but I was just disappointed in how uneventful and short the show was.Attire. I'm quite bad at judging the adventure at hand and dressing appropriate. Dress comfortably as you'll have a lot of walking around to do, and dress warmly (Ponchos too!), especially if your crazy ass insists of sitting in the splash zones. Waterproof mascara and suncreen, my ladies!Journey to Atlantis Ride. It was pretty pointless, as well as short. The big drop in the end was anticlimactic compared to the whole ride. Plus, we had to pay for a stupid locker to store our stuff beforehand.SKYTOWER. We got incredibly lucky and went on the tower right when the fireworks were on! However, I recommend the Skyride above this one for a more exciting and well, intimate ride.Attractions. Seaworld strives to be educational, and I do think you can learn a lot through all the exhibits while being incredibly amused. Being able to touch the tide pool creatures is always a slimy excitement, and seeing sharks above your own head was beautiful. You can see quite a few animals up close, like the walruses, sharks, penguins, beluga whales, polar bears, etc. Use Seaworld.com to plan out what you want to see and once you hit the park, immediately go check the times of the shows, as they're limited and fill up quickly!Overall, Seaworld is what you make out of it. The first time experience is fascinating in terms of seeing all the animals and shows, but you can only remain so interested the second time around."
1748,1/23/2014,4,I grew up in Mission Bay and used to come here all the time as a kid. Now that my kids are old enough to enjoy it we decided to bring them here. They loved it!!!! All the shows were as great as I remember. I love the sea lion show always so funny! I love how they have more rides than they used to especially for the little kids. It was a very fun vacation! The food there was good I just think that everything here seems a bit overpriced. Even at Disneyland it was cheaper to buy a bag of popcorn during a show.
1749,4/21/2015,1,"After Blackfish and the publicity SeaWorld has received about how badly they treat their animals, I don't know how anyone could come here. I last went about 2 years ago, and the whales' living spaces are far too small for them. Some of the rides were fun enough, but the orca show is their bread and butter, and their animals didn't look happy or healthy. I can't imagine what other corners the company has cut to make a few bucks."
1750,10/2/2012,5,"The kiddos love and enjoyed the whole place. There was a large playground area for them. Petting zoo was pretty nice. The animal shows felt like a muscial, you dont see the trainer interact with the animals as before.Super hot during the summers so don't forget your sun block and hats!"
1751,8/3/2011,4,"69$ for a ticket to the park, quite expensive, especially when you re adding 15$ for parking, food inside the park and a little souvenir for the cousin in vacation.I went there with my lil cousin, first time for her seeing sea animals, so i can say i had such a great time with her.We got there by 10 and started with the atlantis attraction before it gets too crowded: very short roller coaster but fun.Then we did the wild arctic ride and it was a good one, the Beluga are very impressive.The Sealions show is a lot of fun even though if one of the sealion has been lazy and didnt want to do anything. The Dolphin show: i ve heard everybody complaining about the fact they dont see that much the dolphins anymore, i think it was a good show, u just have to be a dreamer and just take the show as it is. Dont forget that the animals are not in their natural environment, they re in a water tank entertaining people all day long, everyday.The Shamu show: very impressive especially when you know that Â they can be dangerous for human so even if the show is not long or not as impressive as people are expecting to be, just remember that it s not that easy to train them and they can get tired repeating the same thing all day.The rapids: if you dont want to get wet, dont go there.Over experience was great. I dont know when im going to go back but if i am, next time i ll stay for the nights shows."
1752,9/8/2013,5,"Took my kids for the first time ages 3 and 5 . We had a blast!!! The kids loved the animals, the staff was helpful and friendly. Example: pacific point where you feed sea lions was closed. After the sea lion show the trainer heard me asking about when it would open and how sad we were to miss the opportunity and she offered us all pics with clyde. It made my day!! The rides were a blast and food was really good.Tip: get there a half an hour before park opens they let you and all thou rides are closed you can head to what you want to do/ride first and get right on at open. Tip: pay the extra $5 for parking. $20 total . It put us right in front of exit. And at the end of the day with 2 tired kids you will so thankful you can exit and get right in your car.Tip: buy the all you can eat food passes! $35 If your kids are 4-5 and under no need to get them for your kids. Everytime u walk thru u can get an entree and a side OR dessert and a drink. And you can walk thru at 4 locations as much as you want. We walked thru for breakfast, lunch, dinner,snacks,and bottled water (yes all the bottled water you want which sells for $2 each at stands) all for $70 Have a blast we did. And our ticket deal was buy a day get a day free deal for $63 on there website. So cant wait to go back in september and finally feed those sealions :)"
1753,2/7/2015,5,It is amazing here. So many different shows and so many opportunities to interact with the animals. I didn't like that you pay for parking on top of an already expensive ticket but you deal with it. We spent all day here and had a great time.
1754,1/5/2014,4,"Had a great time with my kids... Getting in was a little frustrating but I understand they are revamping the main entrance door their 50th anniversary next year, but it still could have been more streamlined... Enjoyed the shows... Was a little bummed that the trainers don't swim with the orca's anymore but it was completely understandable... Will go again."
1755,7/15/2011,2,"I'm being harsh a little bit on purpose. Â As an *adult* this place is waning. Â There is no innovation here on their part. Â Honestly, it hasn't changed that much since I was a kid. Â For *kids* I'm sure they love every second of it and that's probably what counts...but hey, my 8 year old doesn't have a Yelp account, so you get me.I saw they had an iPhone app when we walked in so I downloaded it. Â No data updated. Â The app was worthless. Â Don't advertise it if you aren't going to use it!Dolphin Show - wow...this sucks. Â 70% humans, 10% intro, 20% dolphins. Â Seriously. Â They need to go back to the old show. Â The acrobatics were cool but I didn't come to see the ""O"" show, I came to see the *dolphin* show.Cirque de la Mar - this was cool. Â As a kid I remember the bay shows being things like Batman and Robin. Â Things have progressed, but the pre-entertainment was good and I enjoyed the show.Pets Rule - while I think this is cool I'm still confused what a cat/dog show is doing at a marine life park.Anyhow, I was underwhelmed completely. Â Seriously...they need to innovate to step it up. Â And ditch the new dolphin show."
1756,11/20/2013,5,"Just went for Christmas at the park, and it was amazing!! The tree by the entrance is really cool and the new holiday shamu show is much better. Sea world is definitely stepping up there holiday game!"
1757,8/1/2012,5,My son is six now and I've purchased a year pass every year since he turned 3. Â Now my daughter is able to enjoy it too. Â It's nice to be a season pass holder to go for just a few hours any time we want. Â We love it.
1758,7/28/2013,2,"I have to give this place two stars. Â First, the tanks seem really small for the animals. Â It hurts to see animals in captivity like that.This place is super expensive. Â $15 for parking is outrageous. Â Food is extremely overpriced for what you get. Â Exhibits are okay, and it's pretty informative. Â Staff was rude and didn't seem to care. Â Probably my first and only trip. Â The zoo is DAYS better."
1759,10/11/2013,3,"I was so excited to go to Sea world, and by the end of the day, I was not satisfied. I'm not sure if it was because I had not remembered what it was like, but .. I did not remember Sea world being that boring. ESPECIALLY the Shamu show.. Didn't they ride on shamus? Or was the only the dolphins? Whatever it was, everything was pretty impressive, but I feel old now that Sea world does not excite me. I wish I had a beer.. or two... or ten before I went in.. Lol"
1760,1/17/2014,4,I have been here for the las year a couple of times and i would recommend this place to any of my friend and family. The fair grounds are clean and easy to navigate. The shows are magical and the kids would have a great time. Even though its not as big as Disneyland there is still a lot of shows and attractions to go to.
1761,7/10/2012,4,"I liked this place. Â Its cool for young kids. Â Unlike most rides at other theme parks where you have to be over 5 ft tall to ride, all the rides here can accommodate kids 36 inches and above.The shows were OK. Â I felt bad for the whales. Â Their space just looked too small. Â All they could do was to go in circles every five to ten seconds.The rope/net climbing jumpy house thingy was a hit with my kids.Most of the rides didn't take long to get on (compared to other theme parks that take an hour plus). Â The average ride had only about 20 minute wait.We'll probably do this park again in a few years."
1762,2/12/2012,4,":D Second time at SeaWorld, First time at this location though,We came sometimes before noon, straight to the first show. Wanted to watch all of them so we was pretty much walking from one to another, I like it because I'm quite indecisive and hate standing one place ""where should we go next?"" urg hate it. Â So pick up one of the directory/ showtime's on the back, and plan your day here! Â We bought our tickets at my nieces school so it was cheaper, I dont remember exactly how much but yeah, check with your school first before you buy your tickets. Â Food is once again as expected, expensive and isn't really good. I didn't visit all the shop but seem like they sell really similar souvenirs *shurgDid bought a few things for my parents :) cute key charm and some frigde magnetsI think the one i like the most was seeing the big polar bears, they're hugemongous! well a lot larger than i expected! I think the first time i went to seaworld in texas, we went on more rides than actually watching shows or looking at animals. Â Funniest thing is for all the show, we sat on the soak zones but didn't get a tiny bit wet! :) yay us! bottom line is, just like safari park, I would come back here in a few years or maybe on a date :)"
1763,5/31/2012,5,"There are few other places that let you interact with sea life the way SeaWorld does. Â You can pet dolphins, feed sea lions, and watch the killer whales do tricks! Â There are several shows at Sea World that run several times throughout the day. Â The dolphin show was fun, the whale show was AMAZING!!! Â And yes, if you are in the first 12 rows or so, you will get DRENCHED-if not by the spraying fountains, than by the whales deliberately splashing you with their tales! Sea World also has a brand-new, underwater roller-coaster and a few other rides.The price is pretty steep... $73 for an adult. Â (Maintaining whales and sea lions is expensive!!!) Â However, if you order the tickets online and print them from home, they are discounted to $53."
1764,8/8/2011,4,"Between Legoland, San Diego Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park, and Sea World for a 2.5 year old girl I chose Sea World.* She could go on all the rides in the Sesame Street Play Area* Â Very little wait time in lines* Splash Zone while watching dolphins, sea lions, whales jumping* She can easily put her face against the glass and be in awe for as long as she wants.* Lots of indoor places to stay cool - aquarium, penguin encounter, wild artic, shark reef, turtle reef, etc.* Distances between attractions is short so it's easy to watch a show in the blazing sun and then run indoors to cool off ... or if you got wet you can even dry yourself in a HUMAN dryer by the Shipwreck Rapids, for $5 of course.======================So why only 4 stars:Here's the CONS:* Food is overpriced for quantity and quality (compared with Disneyland and Knott's).* Feeding the dolphin now cost $6/tray and the line is longer than ever ... ok it's not a con ... it's inflation.* Shamu Show and Dolphin Show have less and less Shamu and dolphins in the show. Â I remember in the 80's and 90's the shows were primarily featuring the whales and dolphins swimming, jumping, frolicking with the trainers. Â Also I felt it was more educational in the past because the trainers would describe the animals and talk about what each animal can do. Â Now I'm watching more people performing and more computerized imagery. Â At the Shamu Night Show, Shamu jumped only a few times and the rest was us watching the jumbotron. Â If this is your first time, you might think it's fun. Â But compared with 80's and 90's, the shows are just shells of what they used to be.I'm thinking the shows are toned down because of the accidents. Â But I feel like they should still make it educational for the children in the audience and not so much like a circus or music concert. Â I even hear the kids behind me in the shows asking questions about how does Shamu knows when to jump ... or how much dolphins eat? Â I remember ALL THESE general questions were covered in the shows in the 80's and 90's. Â Now kids are left not getting their questions ever answered. Â It's sad that this GREAT learning opportunity has been lost and replaced with brainless entertainment.====================But on to the PROS:* EVERY SINGLE employee is super helpful and nice. Â I did not meet a single employee in the 2 days I was here that was mean or rude in any way. Â I can't say this about Disneyland. Â The trainers are nice too. Â The parking personnel is also nice. Â Why can't all theme parks hire people like Sea World???* Seamore and Clyde is STILL THE BEST SHOW EVER! Â I've always loved their day show so this time I decided to watch just their night show. Â I was laughing from beginning to end. Â All 30 minutes. Â I still love how the sea lions perform too. Â This is one show that has kept up with the times and stayed true to trainers and animals performing together. Â We watched the 8:30 showing and it was a packed house. Â It's way past my 2 year old's bedtime but she LOVED watching it. Â There's constant LIVE action and comedy in this show.* Pet's Rule is still amazing and educational. Â It also hasn't changed much. Â Which is why I keep coming back.* Nice clean park despite the construction at the Manta area. Â (Even this got spoofed at the Sea Lion Night Show).* Fun coaster rides keep on popping up. Â I like this because it keeps the lines short for other non-coaster attractions.* The sky ride is now free.* The spinning tower needle is now free too.* More opportunities for older kids to meet and greet with different animals in the park (beluga whale, dolphins, shamu, etc.) Â Yes all these encounters cost extra but at least it's available if you've got the money.====================I purchased an annual pass from Costco so I'll be coming back again. Â Will update my review if anything new pops up."
1765,9/30/2012,3,"This place has changed a lot since I was last here. Â Now it has rides and a moon bounce Â and a huge jungle gym to climb in and a water area. Â Take the kids and let the energy go!Yes, there are animals around the park, but it is more like they are a side show instead of the main attraction like I remember. Â Signs directing you around the park are few and far between and almost useless. Â Getting lost in the park is very easy and walking by things you want to see or do is likely.We did ride Manta, the blue roller coaster. Â What a great ride! Â FAST, smooth and lots of twisting fun. Â They have a lot of trains on the tracks so the line goes fast. Â The ride is a good length.We also saw the dolphin show. Â Just okay. Â Like I said before, the animals seemed to be a second thought. Â There were people diving and singing and twirling, doing acrobatics during the show. Â The whales and dolphins came out here and there, but only for a bit. Â Get there early and make sure you get a good view.FYI - The price to get in for a day is the same as a membership."
1766,8/30/2015,5,"Sea World was fun with the family and the best part was getting to interact with the Dolphins, they're so cute and adorable like little puppies Â very very hot though, and got sunburned really bad."
1767,11/14/2015,5,"We had an amazing experience today at Sea World San Diego. I brought my almost 8 year old son with Autism, my daughter, and my family to Sea World today. My nephew, who also has Autism, has food allergies. The staff could not have been more accommodating, understanding or encouraging. Either they Â have some of the best training, or they are hiring the right people, perhaps both. Bob, the Director of Culinary Services went out of his way to ensure our kids special dietary needs were met, over and beyond the call of duty. Every team member was positive and sweet to us. Even when my son or nephew would step over the line by not following the two finger touching rule or even be inappropriate with their noises, they would smile and gently remind them of the rules. When I would apologize they would wave us off and say ""I understand."" We have never been treated with the kind of respect and kindness like we received at Sea World at any other theme park or museum. I also am comforted knowing that the kindness shown to us by the staff, is even greater for the animals in your care. If your peripheral staff are that well trained and that instinctively kind, I can only imagine the love and care the animals received from those dedicated to their care. Â We WILL be back and will be very vocal in our special needs community about how amazing Sea World is."
1768,4/2/2012,3,"Sea World is good for a one-day trip, but so expensive.We went on a cloudy and cold day in March so it was not crowded at all. Â If you go on a day like this, you can see everything in a day. Tickets: Expensive, but we went during their promotion of buying a Fun Card and it's good the rest of the year at regular one-day admission price. Â (However, if I use my fun card again, I know I will still end up spending a bunch of money on parking, food, etc.)Food: Expensive, and the restaurants we ate at were buffet style with no indoor seating (not fun on a cold day, and I imagine not fun on a hot summer day either). Â The Calypso Smoke House had really good smoked chicken and brisket though.Shamu Show: Â Disappointing. Â The best part was watching people get splashed and clear out of the ""soak zone"" because it was such a cold day.Sesame Street Playland: This was my kids favorite part, climbing the ropes and Elmo's flying fish.Carnival Games: Outrageously priced. Â The rub-a-dub game was the best deal, $5 for 2 tries, that way if my kids won a small prize on both turns, they could upgrade to a medium prize (stuffed whale). Â Guaranteed prize and cheapest way to let your kids feel like they won a prize.The tide pool: Liked this a lot and wish Sea World had more hands on stuff (included in admission price).Overall, glad I went, had a good time, now working overtime hours to make up for all the money I spent."
1769,8/16/2012,4,"This is my first Sea World experience and it was a good one. First let me say that i got the tickets for free. and after seeing the prices for 1 ticket i cant see how a family of 4 of afford something like this. Price-expensiveFood-ok not to badSesame street area-AWESOME!!Shows-Great (Im a sucker for shows)Bottom line is i dont know if its worth was they charge. 70+for tickets, 15 parking, food+drinks, snacks, etc. but if i get free tickets again i would def. go again!"
1770,12/5/2011,4,"Killer whales jumping through the air. Splashing you with waves of water. YEAH!!! If you don't want to get soaked but still want close pictures of whales doing their thing, sit like three rows in from the start of the ""soak zone"". Don't be fooled by shamu swimming fun little circles and his baby splashes in the middle of the pool. He'll soak you with his tail at the end of the show. People with their fancy cameras got SOAKED in the middle row of the soak zone cause they didn't think shamu could splash that much. I wish they had more picture taking zones so I could make all my friends jealous that I went to Seaworld."
1771,9/16/2011,2,"The seal show was pathetic. I could throw my freakin' black Lab into our backyard pool for more entertainment. The opening act (done by a male actor) was fun, though... but it was 100 MPH into the toilet after that. Shamu show was preachy. YAWN. Enough talk about conservation and save the planet. Most of this entire place is preach, preach, preach. UGH... ENOUGH ALREADY!!! Â Best part was when the trainers ordered the whales to splash the hell out of the audience. That made up for a generally boring show. Â Some great indoor aquarium displays, but someone needs to squeegee the tanks. I had to wipe them off to see what was inside many of the tanks because the condensation on the glass was thick. Be sure to find the Wolf eel... this thing is horrifying!!!! Also, signage throughout the park was poor, making it difficult to navigate. Most of the employees were miserable. This place is no Disney, let me tell you. You don't walk around feeling all happy, like you do at Disney. Also, don't bring your baby, unless you want to hear, ""If he/she can't walk 3 steps in front of me right now, you can't take him/her on the ride... even if you hold him/her."" Ridiculous policy. Not very baby friendly. Also, the Wild Arctic exhibit doesn't allow strollers. So I carried my 1 year old inside. There wasn't a reason in the world a stroller couldn't go through... it was all flat surfaces and wide paths. Another baby-unfriendly policy. And whatever you do... DO NOT EAT AT THE ""SHIP WRECK CAFE!"" Talk about pure crap food. It's not even elementary school food... it's really that bad. They served sides of ""grilled veggies"" that I swear someone dumped a can of sterno into the pot while cooking them. They literally tasted like a toxic chemical was inadvertently spilled into it. We should have informed the manager. I honestly think people must have gotten horribly sick from these, I can't imagine anyone would have dared eaten them... the smell alone made everyone at our table conjecture what cooking chemical could have splashed into them. The turkey was palatable. The bread for the veggie burgers was crap. Basically garbage food. Eat somewhere else in the park as this place is a long, slow-moving lined disaster. Â Overall, I would have much rather have gone to Disney, even though I've been there multiple times. Sea World is mostly boring save a few exhibits. Not a reason in the world to ever go back. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz"
1772,10/23/2013,4,"My four year old loves SeaWorld. We moved to San Diego in January of 2013 and one of our first stops was, in fact, SeaWorld. He has been hooked ever since, so of course we opted to get the season passes. I like that they offer you the passes for the same price as a one-day admission. I also think it's pretty cool that military personnel get in for free once a year. SeaWorld has a lot to offer, but it is really one of those places that once you've been a couple of times you've pretty much seen it all. I hate crowds and it seems that no matter when you come to SeaWorld you have to fight a crowd. I love the special events they do for holidays. Keeps things for us pass holders exciting!"
1773,6/30/2015,4,"Overall, great place. Safe, fun and entertaining. I love the orcas and dolphins. The shows are fantastic without any dull moments. The one things that I'm disappointed of is the food. The food isn't all too tasty, but it's something to eat."
1774,7/14/2011,4,"Blah Blah same ol stuff that has been said. My few tidbits. Fast pass type thing, expensive and may not have been worth it after all. Dining pass thing, seems expensive but totally worth it. Hat, suncreen, water bottles... all a must."
1775,8/8/2017,1,"Sea World San Diego sucks. Â They offer military/veteran specials but do not honor their promotions. Â I submitted my DD 214 through their IDme link which clearly states I am retired and disabled. Â My DD 214 was rejected because they wanted a military retirement ID card. I refuse to submit more documentation. Â My DD 214 is sufficient to prove my status. The website stated it would accept any documentation including a DD 214. Â I submitted a Better Business Bureau complaint regarding their refusal to honor their promotion and Sea World San Diego refused to address the complaint through my complaint with BBB. Â The case was closed today August 8, 2017 because Sea World San Diego did not address my complaint adequately according to the BBB. Â This public relations promotion may serve Reservists and those still on active duty but as a retired active military combat disabled veteran San Diego Sea World is full of S***!"
1776,11/9/2015,5,"Our family has membership passes. Â It is very frustrating that the PETA group and the undocumented film ""Blackfish"" had such an impact on an organization that is doing a good thing. Â Unfortunately, a picture is worth a thousand words and even though ""Blackfish"" misrepresented the truth, most people won't know the truth because they don't investigate the people responsible for the film or those in the film. Â Sorry, for the Orcas, the impact this will have on future animals in danger, the missed opportunity for people to see what these animals are capable of, and the trainers who truly enjoy the challenge."
1777,9/8/2014,4,"I love SeaWorld's variety of species and tanks which provide as comfortable homes for it's animals. Their animals are kept well and fed by sustainable fish. Their sea turtle exhibit is amazing, there's even a Napolean fish in the same tank! The seals are smelly but still fun to watch swim around and make noises. The polar bear exhibit is nice and cold for the polar bears and the beluga whales. However I feel as thought the beluga whale tank isn't big enough. And as much as I LOVE sharks I really dislike the ""scary shark music"" playing in the shark exhibit which only reinforces the untrue killer shark stereotypes. However their variety of sharks is great, sharks are my favorite marine animal! I also enjoy the bat star exhibit, with hundreds of bat stars there's one for everyone to touch. My favorite part of the park is seeing the large tanks with large communities of fish, I think their leopard sharks are a little overweight looking though (in my opinion). The penguin exhibit is always very interesting, it had about 3 different types of penguins in the main exhibit and it's amazing to see them swim so swiftly though the water. DEAR EVERYONE, although the ride is named manta, the sting rays you pet ARE NOT MANTA RAYS, THEY ARE BAT RAYS. As a marine bio major it makes it seem as though SeaWorld is trying to misinform their guests. The food is overpriced for it's average quality. I personally do not like watching any shows. I do not approve of SeaWorld forcing dolphins and orcas to perform for human entertainment, even as a kid it is for this reason I always preferred Birch Aquarium or the Living Coast Discovery Center. I am NOT a Blackfish propaganda crazy, I still enjoy SeaWorld and am appreciative of their donations to other wildlife organizations and for rescuing injured local marine animals. The park is very large, if you do not enjoy hours and hours and hours of walking, perhaps SeaWorld is not for you. It does tend to get very crowded but even then the experience is still enjoyable to be intrigued by the ocean."
1778,8/17/2011,3,"The Beluga whales, shark experience and getting splashed by an orca was rad. I liked the sky tower as well. However, for a place that supports conservation, it feels more like an amusement park with a few fish in it. The aquarium section was a major disappointment. I'm kind of a snob about aquariums though since I've been to most of the major ones in the US. Plus, I worked at an awesome local aquarium in San Pedro (Cabrillo Marine Aquarium). Like the zoo, they serve overpriced alcohol. So, if you are not a kid person and want to block out the screams BYOB. They do check backpacks at the front though, so put it in a purse or other stealth area, like your crotch or something.If you do go, see the Belugas, see the sharks, and definitely get in on the Shamu experience in the soak zone. You really do get soaked. And, then you are properly stoked *smile*"
1779,12/18/2011,5,"I went to this theme park when I was younger and was very excited to revisit Shamu and friends again this year. Seaworld was just as much fun as I had remembered. Going to Seaqworld during the holidays may seem bizarre but it was great with sunny weather and small crowds. Sure, it was a little like when Shrek and Donkey visit Dulock with its music blaring over an empty landscape full of Christmas decorations. But that is what makes it so much fun. The Wild Artic ride is a must, maybe not for the littlest ones but it's a blast for adults and older kiddos alike. Of course everyone wants to see the killer whales, and you should. Also don't miss the dolphin and pilot whale show, it's equally impressive and entertaining. Don't count on good food here, everything was terrible that I had. So pack something or plan on being hungry."
1780,8/13/2012,4,"My second trip to the Sea World San Diego.Animals were cute and cuddly as always. Saw the dolpin show, Shamu and the Sea Lions. Â My favorite was the Sae Lion show with cute little otter running in.$15 to park and $73 to get in - ok that's $85 before anything starts. Add to that food and you are at $100 for a day trip. Several in our group of 8 opted to skip Sea World due to the high cost.Also rode the Manta roller coaster - as high speed coasters go this was somewhat tame and nowhere near the fright factor of the Manta at the Orlando Sea World."
1781,7/6/2012,5,"Shamu I miss you! Â You are so cute! Â I learn so much at Sea World about different types of animal! Â I didn't get a chance to eat the turkey leg, but will try it next time!Did I mention there is a place not far from Sea World that you can park for free? Â If anyone is interested, PM me. :)"
1782,6/18/2011,2,"If you aren't five years old this place blows. Â I sat in the 16th row and got blasted by Shamu. Â At that point, I declared war on that fu$%&*ing whale. Â I was well beyond the splash zone and due to the throngs of annoying families, was forced to sit there. Â I hope that whale meets a slow painful demise, at the hands of a Â japanese fishing vessel. Â But I digress, it wasn't that bad. Â The fireworks and that Atlantis ride were not too shabby."
1783,3/17/2011,1,"Wow, worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Â I am specifically speaking of the annual pass auto-pay system. Â I highly recommend that you NEVER give them your credit card info. Â One upon a time, looking at the picture of my son on the card, it looks to be about 8 years ago, I signed up for the annual membership on EZ-pay. Â They were going to charge my card in 12 monthly payments. Â The next year, I was still being charged and asked about it and they said it will continue to renew until I cancel it. Â I figured we would probably go once or twice a year, so I left it like that.As my son got older, we just quit going. Â My credit card number has changed several times since then, but the charges manage to continue. Â Yes, even American Express messed up this thing. Â Twice American Express told me that they made it impossible for Sea World to charge my card ever again. Â They charges have continued. Â But, back to Sea World - last summer I contacted them to cancel it - I figured it was done, charges continued. Â I tried to cancel via online - there seems to be no possible way to do that. Â I complained to American Express - they said they would stop the phone number of that merchant from processing the card in the future. Â The charges continued. Â I called American Express again - they promised that they were making sure that Sea World could NEVER charge my account again and I had nothing to worry about. Â The charges continued.Here I am on my third new account number since this all started. Â My account number changes have to do with other fraud, I wasn't changing the account numbers because of Sea World. Â I opened my bill today and there is yet another Sea World charge. Â The phone number attached to the charge is out of state, but I called and after 12 minutes of waiting for a live person, got a man who said he couldn't help me because the membership is in California and I called Florida. Â I said that I called the number on my bill, since nothing else has worked. Â He said there is no way that he could help, but would transfer me to California. Â Here I am paying long distance phone charges just to be transferred back locally.....A young woman answered and I explained the situation. Â She looked up the account and asked me what I want her to do. Â Uh.... I already told her that I've been trying to cancel it, but okay, I told her to cancel it and never charge my card again. Â She said that she had to put me on hold because she didn't know how to to that. Â After a while, she came back and asked which account I was cancelling. Â I told her I only had one. Â She said that I've been being charge for two. Â WTF????? Â I said that as far I have known, I have been paying for one. Â Well, she said she cancelled both. Â We shall see next month. Â All I can say is that I've never had such crap service in my life. Â No apologies, no offers of compensation - nothing. Â I wish I could give negative stars."
1784,8/26/2011,4,"Our kids love this place! Â We went 2 days in a row during our last trip to San Diego. Â The shows are great and the rides are fun. Â My youngest child really enjoyed the kids water area. Â My husband really enjoyed the beer! Â The food is not overly priced for an amusement park. Â I feel like the price for the ticket is a little steep unless you purchase from Costco or another discount place. Â If you purchase a ticket at the gates it is like $65 per day for adults. Â Yikes! Â My only suggestion for SeaWorld is to maybe switch up some of the shows. Â We were out 3 years ago and they still have the same shows.All in all, it is still much more fun than the Zoo and we will be back."
1785,6/23/2012,5,"I am literally Sea World San Diego's biggest fan. As in I would've yelped this place if Yelp existed back when I was a kid and going to Sea World literally every weekend. And so yes, I'm yelping it now. From the first visit on it has always been a magical place for me, even more than Disney (land and world). [The San Diego one is also much better than the Orlando one.] And please, it's not a real Sea World experience UNLESS you get in the splash zone for at least two of the shows and spend some money in the arcade. Oh sweet memories :)"
1786,6/9/2013,5,"Well, just went back to Sea World two days ago after not visiting it for 13 years. Don't plan on returning if things continue as they are. They have removed aquariums and other things related to their original theme in order to replace them with roller coasters and water rides. I guess no one cares about learning anymore? It's all about the ""thrills"" and entertainment. Every where you turn they are trying to sell you something. Very over commercialized. The prices are crazy steep. Almost 150 to get two adults inside. My brother-in-law ordered a water and caramel corn at the orca show and it came to nine dollars. Going in they search your bags now, unlike before. And i had to submit a finger print to get in also. This place is as tight as a frogs ass. I heard that the park was sold since i went last time. A generous two stars since i am not so tight."
1787,5/19/2012,5,Had such a great time here with our kiddo. The play area for the kids is awesome too. Great way for them to chilax and have fun!
1788,7/22/2011,5,"Sea world is a great place for anyone interested in learning/seeing beautiful sea animals that you would almost never see out in the wild or get ever get close to on your own. Â The Conservation and protection message is all over the place and in any show you see and they do a good job of informing the youth of that message too. Â They have a cool sesame street section that little kids love and singing and dancing shows that accompany them.Its a great place to visit and take the kids.**Rant**Anyone giving sea world less than the full 5 stars is a dork, C'mon you know what you are going to get, Sea Life!!! Â How can you rate Sea Life less than the full 5 stars?? Â ""yeah I went and saw the see life but, I can do the same thing on my High def computer monitor and spend $0"" Â Soo what they talk about conservation and protecting the species, Hello they are supposed to do that, it is up to us to protect these beautiful animals from extinction and pollution they cannot do it themselves, Geez!Ok I suppose it is a little pricey and if thats your gripe I can understand and appreciate that, times are tough and you should have stayed home then."
1789,6/9/2011,4,"This is hands down my daughters favorite place in the world to be. Morning, noon and night she asks ""we go see whales, we go see penguins?"". It's a beautiful park and they have the absolute best shows! I think I actually enjoy the pets show slightly more than my three year old. I don't know if it would be quite as much fun if you had ""tweenage"" kids though since there are only one or two adult rides. The tickets are highly priced (like every other theme park in SoCal) but they offer a fantastic deal for yearly rates. Buy one full price ticket, come back the rest of the year for free. Umm, ok! We live 30 minutes away so I can feed my toddlers obsessive need for whales and penguins on any given weekend with the pass. I only dinged one star because of the food. We have tried 3-4 of the restaurants and they are always AWFUL. Of course this fact would be a lot more tolerable if the food wasn't soooooo expensive. I adore you Sea World, but how do you screw up a hot dog? Never the less, we will happily be coming back many times this year."
1790,8/17/2011,3,Will the real Shamu please splash up?! Please splash up?! Please splash up?!They had like 20 fricken' Shamus...anyway it was cool.Belugas rocked.Sharks rocked.Amusement park atmosphere sucked.Screaming kids everywhere sucked.Free beer by walking out of the cafeteria without finding the register=awesome.
1791,6/24/2015,4,"As a San Diego local I appreciate this place. San Diego needs all the attractions it can get. Unfortunately the documentary has really hurt their revenue. I'm not too concerned about how they treat their animals because if they treated them bad before and continue to do even after the film's downturn on the business they will not be open very long. So basically they better have great practices in place now. my girlfriend and I went last weekend on Saturday and it was not busy at all. very surprised about that! We watched the dolphin show, the pet show, and the cirque show. All were really impressive. The trainers are good at working with their animals. The dolphin show was cool because the trainers rode on the dolphins, the pet show was cool because the animals were highly trained to operate on their own, and the cirque show was cool because watching humans do crazy dance and acrobatic moves is always cool! the rides are kind of corny and the roller coasters are not intense. This is definitely a park that I would recommend to families with young kids who love animals. It would be a great place for them. overall i was not thoroughly impressed but not frustrated with seaworld. give it a shot if you're in the area. once is good"
1792,7/16/2012,3,"I would give this place 3.5 stars but maybe because I just had a lot of fun with the person I was with when I went (yes, brownie points for me!).My boyfriend and I got there when the park opened on Saturday and paid for preferred parking...which was really close to the park entrance and exit as it should be. Â The first ride we went on was the Manta and there was definitely a line but the wait wasn't as long. Â As we were watching the ride in action, it didn't seem like it was going too fast but it was a totally different story once you're on that ride. Â  Oh, and a word of advice, don't sit behind very young kids. Â Let's just say the poor little girl in front of us threw up after the ride (thankfully, it was AFTER but still unfortunate). Â We also got to see the penguins, sharks, flamingos and other animals but there wasn't much. Â The place was just kind of small. Â I think it's only better for those who are actually getting a hands-on experience with the dolphins by feeding and swimming with them. Â That should probably be the highlight of this place. Â We also got to see the Elmo 4D show and it was horrible. Â The video was messed up and so it was painful to watch so I didn't really watch it. Â The Cirque show was pretty cool but we left after a few minutes into the show. Â The water rides were the best part but that's totally subjective. Â They even have a drying station that's $5 and it's even that was a rip-off because the hot hair mainly came out of the top and bottom vents with little heat distributed through the middle area. Â So basically, our hair and feet were dry but our shirts/shorts were still wet. Â Overall, I won't be coming back here for a long time and would rather go somewhere else."
1793,4/29/2017,2,"This is a very touchy subject to me know how orcas live Â in pods and they very social mammals and have deep connections to their family members. Â  I feek they are much like humans. Â They have their own language, race , territory..... Â  I have been visiting seaworld with my girlfriend (three times). because she is a federal worker who gets free passes. Â  Today we went in a bought a seven seas passes so we can try all the different cuisines and unfortunately we have to use them by 7 pm and we were not aware. YES....we should have paid better attenion We shouldnt pay more then $130 of my own money on food and drink vouchers to find out $20 worth is no longer valid because of a time slot. Â We went to customer service thinking they might help but I should have figured a place that enslaves intelligent mammals would decline to help. If you read this please remember dolphins and Orcas are probably the most amazing mammals beside ourselves."
1794,10/3/2013,2,"Went to this park on weekday with friendsIt's not worth the money or the time unless you have a kid ,Most of the food carts were closed The park was almost emptyNothing to do much"
1795,8/11/2013,5,"Do yourself a favor; stop by and watch the night seal and otter show. Biff was great!!! My husband, my 10 and 7 year old boys loved it. The whole place is magical but really the Seal and Otter show is fantastic."
1796,9/21/2013,5,"my family and me love sea world!!! we have the silver pass which was 85 bucks in Costco. at least two visits, the pass pays for it self. you get free parking and entrance and you get discounts in all your park purchases. so if people complain about the parking......DONT!!! and if you say that you have the year pass, and are complaining about the parking you should've thought about purchasing the silver pass! we love all the aquariums, shows, attractions, etc. sometimes on the weekends it gets packed so its hard to see everything calmly because people start crowding all over you.we always get the all you can eat deal its pretty good. same thing, it pas for it self in two visits to the restaurants. we usually always go to three of them so we get our fill for the day!!  so to top it off its fun going to sea world randomly on my day off with the family just to have good family day......and really that silver pass is worth it!"
1797,1/27/2015,1,"Well we won't be going back to $ea World, ever. Well I shouldn't say never, they could wake up one day and decide to do the right thing. Walking over the foot bridge of Shamu Stadium seeing Orcas struggling to pass through gates into their swimming pool is depressing. We thought $ea World was changing. When the roller coaster was being built we thought maybe they were going in a different direction. This is not the case. We want beer and roller coasters! You suck at taking care of whales and dolphins. You can keep all the little fishes but the orcas and dolphins need to go. They have bigger brains than you. $ea World is for profit. If you want to increase attendance, build roller coasters and beer gardens. I have always wondered why $ea World doesn't house it's mammals on the bay since they are situated on the water? At least then they would be in the ocean. Figure it out $ea World! Your park is depressing. We go whale watching now."
1798,6/14/2009,4,"Every time I go to SeaWorld, three things happen:1. A seagull sh*ts on me. EVERY TIME!2. I get sunburned within an inch of my life. Even with sunblock.3. I never sit close enough at the Shamu show to get wet. I still love it, because I love huge things that swim. Who doesn't?! It reminds me of my childhood - even the seagull guano - and brings back great memories.If you can stand to stay that long, take in the fireworks show. I used to be able to see it from my bedroom window every summer night when I lived in San Diego."
1799,7/17/2009,4,"I just went here a couple of days ago with friends. It is the exact same as I remember from when I was a kid.The Sea Lion and Otter Show, I think, has become lame, however. When I was a kid, I remember it was a great show! Or maybe the show was great BECAUSE I was a kid ... who knows? Also, one of my main reasons for coming here was to check out Journey to Atlantis ... however, when I got there, I discovered that it has been shut down for some time now. LAME!But employees there are very helpful though. I specifically remember Austin and Melanie being really cool and willing to help out a lot.Still a fan. =)"
1800,5/22/2011,2,"This is awful, it is painful to write this review....Sea World has had a very special place in my heart, very much in the same sense that Disneyland has. Â But when I paid my $12 to park my car on a midweek after noon (about 2pm) and hobbled on my broken foot to the entrance and saw a massive line for tickets...I wondered...has it always been like this? Literally, eight groups of families waiting and one ticket booth open....After waiting thirty minutes, I looked at my friend and we decided that a $69.99 ticket to this place that can't even open up additional ticket boxes for their patrons wasn't worth it. It's not just about the wait that has conjured such disgust in me....it's not even about not having enough ticket boxes to help the families that are here to pay money to see your park...maybe, they are downsizing...Sea World was looking a bit dreary....But, every employee that I saw driving around the parking lot or by the entrance looked miserable....These are not the same happy faces I remembered from my childhood or smiles I see from the SD Zoo or Disney. I would hope that you pay for what you get, but I have a feeling every cent spent here would've been an absolute waste. It was a horrible experience and we didn't even go in. I bumped it up a star because I still have a soft spot for this place. But, it will be a very long time before I try to come here, again."
1801,2/1/2012,5,"I hate roller coasters but LOVE water rides. I was saving the ride for later in the day since it didn't open until 12pm on Monday and I didn't want to walk around drenched all day long. Boyfriend and I were early for the other Shamu show, so we went to the ride first .. I practically had to drag my bf on this ride. And he wins cause I landed the wettest seat on the ride, but he also lost cause he got the second wettest seat lol. And yay there was no wait! Those $5 dryers outside the ride might be worth it if you ended up going on the ride early in the day and didn't want to be walking around soaking wet. Those dryers are big enough for multiple people to use at the same time."
1802,12/14/2012,4,I finally went to Sea World last summer for the first time. Â It was pretty cool seeing the dolphins and penguins. Â The shows were fun and my favorite part of the day was going on the new roller coast. Â  :)
1803,11/19/2013,3,"Its a cool place to take your kids. The rides are not that great but this is not a place for rides, its a place to see fish. Also if your hungry , the food sucks. I swear to you , I would not lie, I tried every place to eat at sea world hoping to stumble upon something good to eat but all of there resteraunts were over priced and served extremely bad tasteing food. Everything thing at Sea world is over priced. I recommend eating before you enter and just pack extra snacks for your kids. Also bring your own bottled water because they will charge you 8.00 bucks for a small Coke. But all in all it was fun and there live shows were pretty fun to watch. If you tell the parking people your just droping off your kids, they will let you in for free and you'll get to save 15.00 on parking. Â Just go ahead and park for free they will never know and they will not tow your car. With the money I saved on parking , I was able to by my kid a cool Sham mu doll."
1804,4/24/2012,2,"I was really looking forward to my Sea World San Diego trip. Â I was able to get their normal overpriced tickets ($73!) for a discount ($53) which helped start things off. Â Then we arrived at the park. Â First thing we did was head to the Sky Tower which overlooks the park. Â While up there, I noticed that it seemed to be an incredibly small park. Â We stopped for the Shamu show and the Dolphin show. Â Shamu was isn't worth the time to pile into the stadium; the dolphin show was more entertaining as they threw in some circus acrobat performers. Â We went through each exhibit all the while expecting something to wow us or teach us something. Â After about 3 hours we left the park, as we had done everything there is to do (we were not interested in water rides that day as it was cloudy and quite cool). Â I wish that the Manta ride was open as that at least may have been a highlight. Â Overall, this park is way overpriced, with small cramped exhibits, and large areas of the already small park that do not appear to be used for anything in particular. Â I have been to Sea World Orlando and loved it! Â That is the reason I was looking forward to this visit. Â However, this location was very disappointing, and I sadly recommend saving your money, time and energy for something else."
1805,3/20/2016,5,So much fun I love sea world regardless of what they say. Animals are so beautiful to be seen
1806,7/3/2013,3,"this review is for the shamu night show. Â it sucks!!! Â don't bother to stick around for it. Â the shamu jumps around a few times and that's it. time wasted. Â you know what was good though? Â the SNL show. Â the sea lions at night show. Â get there early. there was an actor doing dances to a bunch of the latest songs. Â that Â was the highlight of the trip to sea world. Â this guy was hilarious and really good! Â two thumbs up to him!! Â the SNL show is basically a parody of all the other shows at seaworld. Â its kinda funny if you know how all the other shows go. Â get the silver pass at costco for $99 and get the whole year. Â totally worth it, free parking and all."
1807,3/10/2012,4,"We loved Sea World. The shows are (mostly) amazing, but can be a little stupid sometimes. We planned our day to see every show possible, but it was pretty difficult to get through the whole place. They could do a little bit better arranging the timing of the shows so it is easily possible to go from one side to the other, show to show. But I'd imagine they want you to have to walk back and forth so you are more likely to buy stuff in between.If PETA ever gets there way, then the ""extreme suffering"" of the animals will be ended, and this place will be closed down. Those people are pretty idiotic.Go on a sunny day, wear sun block, and sit in the splash zones!"
1808,6/21/2011,2,"If you really want to experience the sea creatures, go to one of the many tide pools around San Diego, then go on a chartered boat and see the big whales, dolphins, etc in their natural habitat. Â  For those of you who enjoy the fireworks, try living in Bay Park during the summer. Really Sea World, You must have fireworks every single night at 10pm? Â What do fireworks have to do with fish anyway? Nothing.. If anything, it's polluting the bay more than it already was."
1809,2/8/2011,2,"Maybe it was that I went on a bad day. Â Or maybe it could just be blamed on the twilight zone vibe created by the near emptiness of this place during the off-season. Â Or maybe I am simply jaded from the theme-park excellence and magic that is Disneyland. Â I am not sure of the reason, but I am sure of the fact that SeaWorld- to me- is just...weird. Â Don't get me wrong- I liked going eye-to-eye with a great white shark (only being separated by a thick piece of glass). Â Seeing penguins zoom through the water and chase each other around was also cool. Â The beluga whales and polar bear exhibit definitely made you appreciate the power of these creatures. Â Getting splashed from the dolphins jumping around? Thumbs up. Â But I didn't like the bird crap all over the seats of the outdoor theaters. Â (I understand you can't help it if birds dump on your theater, but you can hire people to clean it up every once in a while.) Â The sea lion and sea otter show was awful- I am pretty sure there is better acting and story-lines in low-budget porn. Â And only two Shamu shows with limited seating on a Saturday? Â Disappointing. Â To make matters worse, almost every employee I encountered simply seemed depressed or disinterested. Â How much do they charge for this experience, you ask? Â $70 per person. Seriously. Â I guess you are paying for all of the Veterinary staff and equipment, but $70 seems far too high for the experience."
1810,7/20/2012,2,"I'll give 2 stars because (1) I can see how younger kids can enjoy the rides, (2) for the rescue efforts they make.And here's where I took away the stars: (1) My husband and I took our daughter primarily to visit Sesame St by the Bay since she was having a SS themed celebration. Â Where were you hiding all the characters SeaWorld?(2) We are both big animal lovers, and needless to say we left feeling very sad for the big ocean creatures that were kept in small spaces. Â The whales, sea lions, dolphins and sea turtles mainly because these animals love to swim vast distances in the ocean.(3) The other thing that saddened me was learning that the show animals (and others too I am sure) are on anti-depressant to keep them alive in *captive-conditions*. Â I am all for rescues, but c'mon SeaWorld, free some of your animals back into the wild where they belong (unless they won't survive in nature that is-but then why breed more in captivity because even those born in captivity would naturally desire to be out in the ocean - basic instincts).(4) Tickets are $70 a person and parking is a hefty $15 as is. Â When we purchased our parking ticket they ask us if we want to park in the premium lot for $25!? Â You have got to be kidding me... especially when we found regular parking next to the premium parking lot, not far from the entrance.Tips: Be prepared to wait in long lines for shows and rides, so take hats, sun-block and water for your kids.We had our hands stamped to return after lunch, but decided to relax on the beach instead. Â For being such a popular attraction, I suppose there is a good reason why they only scored an average of 3.5 stars (to-date)."
1811,8/29/2014,5,"My kids enjoy the park and all the attraction, like the Madagascar Show, its a great place to enjoy for the afternoon."
1812,6/21/2014,3,"Its very true, you can finish the entire park in a matter of hours, which makes paying $80 per person very daunting. The shows are very nice, but please think of a better canopy system for the seating. I got soo burned it hurt for days! Just for sitting at the shows, so wear plenty of sunblock and wear a hat! The exhibits havent changed much in years but are still nice to visit. I know Budweiser sponsors you, but please offer a better variety of drinks. I love love the new Manta ride! and Atlantis is fun too! Ive also done the Dolphin Encounter, which is extra money, but totally worth it! It was an experience i'll never forget. Overall, its pricey, but I always have a good time here."
1813,2/21/2010,5,"This is my favorite SeaWorld. Ok, to be fair, I haven't visited the one in San Antonio YET, but I will. But I like the layout of this one better than in Orlando. The dolphin feeding pool in particular is more accessible. Do yourself a favor and head to that immediately upon arrival (assuming you get there when they open). Just hang a right when you get in the park. Well, that's assuming they haven't changed it since I visited in 2002, so YMMV.Another thing I liked about this park is that you could peek into the pool where they train with the killer whales. We got to catch them practicing while there (see my posted photos)."
1814,5/21/2011,3,"I had a lot of fun here, but I'm not sure I would come back again. The dolphin area where you can try to touch theDolphins was really cool and i spent a lot of time there and the sea lions were also awesome . The shows, however, were terrible! Especially the whale show, it was so lame and boring since the trainers won't go in the water. The dolphin show was also really lame with a crappy disneyesque story which was unnecessary. A girl comes out and there's a song playing describing that she dreams of swimming with dolphins.... so lame, I just want to see the dolphins! They added a bunch of acrobatics to the show too that were just not what I think people want to see at Seaworld. Also, the tower where you can see the park is (now!?!?) free but it spins just a little too fast for a little too long, leaving all of us dizzy. Atlantis was fun, I think it was really cool that the roller coaster car is taken up by an elevator to the top of the coaster.... that was something neat and different. A weird thing I noticed is that the park tries to sell you pictures of yourself around every corner... It makes the place seem desperate for money. Overall, it was fun, but I couldn't spend more than a day here."
1815,8/10/2013,4,Went for my daughters birthday. (she is 7) I was NOT excited to go.. All the bad reviews.. But we did have fun.parking we paid for the up close parking 5 more bucks..ok no biggie.. so 20 bucks to park is steep. we pre bought tickets on line for the park saved some money that way. Just be sure person who purchased them has photo ID and cc to PROVE they are them lol we did the shows.. all pretty good. better then they used to be.. best one is the later afternoon /evening show SLL comedy spoof on all the shows.. kids liked Â the splash area for kids.. food blows.. we did take in snacks and water. They checked the bags but didn't say anything. Â we just shared a few items that with snacks was fine.. Â they do serve beer throughout Â so if that is your deal you will be pleased. Â all in all a great day. rides were fun. Atlantis you get soaked on.. but the kids loved it. and Manta was fun but be prepared for a long line and short ride.They are adding some new things. They really NEED to..the park is over priced and not that much to do or see.. so I am glad they get they need to step it up. I would go back..just cause the kids loved it! be sure to bring lots of water and sunscreen. the shows you get baked and its so HOT..why they don't add some cover on those stadiums is beyond me. were dying of heat stroke Â in those stands SEA WORLD lol
1816,1/12/2012,5,"Love this place. It is perfect to have a season pass (get at least the sliver pass so you don't have to pay for parking) when you live in SD. It's a great place to go to get a good walk, run out energy in your kids and see some cool stuff all in one. The shows are fun to watch but try and get there at least 10 minutes before a show so you can get a good seat. Food is expensive so we always bring food with us, which saves oodles of money. Get one of the souvenir cups and you can take it back with you to get refiled for only $1 as much as you want."
1817,9/2/2011,3,"The shows were great hands down. Â Avoid this place at all cost on Saturdays the other yelpers were right. Its crazy, almost got ran over by a stroller a few times.The rides ehhh what rides besides Journey to Atlantis.Shamu was great and the dolphins were awesome.If you want to feed the dolphins be prepared to wait for more than an hour. People lined up quick and there are only a limited amount of people who can feed and they cut the line off."
1818,11/7/2013,3,"I hadn't been here since middle school. Â My gf and I decided to go and we got the buy a day ($79) get the year free which seems cool. We went Sunday morning when the park was just opening. Parking $15 and if you want to park up close its called premier parking for $20. Â Got into the park when they opened (10am) and dam, it was really empty which i thought was awesome. We decided to see the shamu show and blue horizons, and we planned our day from there. The first thing we did was the artic helicopter tour which was like an extremely outdated star tours. We ended up seeing most of the exhibits by the time of the shamu show which started at 12pm. The show was about 25 min and it went by really fast. Â I actually enjoyed the people sitting in the splash zone, with their phones out, get soaked more than the show itself.After the show we walked around trying to waste time and decided to get a $8 funnel cake, no bueno. Finally it was time for the blue horizons show, and I was disappointed. Â It was more people doing stuff than animals and I thought birds were going to do some tricks too.So once that was over there really wasn't much to do and ended up leaving around 230pm. Overall it was nice to visit, but you get through everything really quick on slow days and end up leaving early."
1819,7/4/2012,4,Biff from the Seal show is my fave! he was SOOOO funny!Shamu rocks was fun too! I love jumping whales! Reminds me of myself jumping on a trampoline!The dolphin show was weird! why were their birds there and guys dressed up as birds?! I don't get it! I want to see flipper! And why were their pilot whales with the dolphins! shouldnt they perform with shamu!?!?! i'm so confused!my favorite part of sea world was starbucks. oh and the turkey leg. but the turkey leg from california adventure was way awesomer!i will be back again! hopefully next time the starbucks will serve frapps!
1820,6/13/2011,4,"After reading some of the reviews I was bracing myself for disaster. Â Horror tales of demon children and horrible employees seem to crop up all over the place. Â Instead of a nightmare I had a great time and I had never been there before so I don't have to worry about any nostalgia clouding my judgment. Â I even went on Memorial day and the park was packed.I thought SeaWorld had a nice mix of shows, rides, exhibits and education that kept the place from getting too boring.The one thing I wish they did was post the times of the day that the animals were more likely to be active - luckily we made one last stop by the polar bears because they were asleep the first time we stopped by.The food/parking/souvenirs are overpriced, but would you expect anything else?"
1821,7/2/2012,2,"Wouldn't make special trip to San Diego just to go there. That is to say that if I was already in San Diego and given free tickets, sure I would go, but I would not make this the purpose of your trip to San Diego. You'd think that I with all those animals I might have learned something about them, but all I learned about Shamu is that what he and all his friends love to do most is splash the audience (after which point I realized that is the same water that they eat, sleep, piss and crap in, but I'm not counting that as a point against them. I just find it funny how excited everyone was by it).I also found there to be a raging hypocrisy that is looming throughout the park. I'm no environmentalist, and I disagree with PETA on just about every one of their stances on almost everything (that is to say I don't abuse animals). However, At every single display, show, and even their rides you are constantly told how important it is to protect the ocean and all of our aquatic friends who live there. If all of that is true can someone please explain to me the pearl cart where you can pay $15 bucks to crack open an oyster and scoop out its guts so you can take home a shiny pear. I guess they're just not cute enough to make the list of animals in the ocean we're supposed to protect, sucks to be them I guess.Also not enough to do there to justify a $75 price tag."
1822,7/7/2015,5,"First rate theme park! Â Excellent exhibits and shows. Â You and your family will learn so much about sea animals, and in breathtaking surroundings. Â Spring for the line pass during the summer. Â They send out several dollars off coupons that you can take advantage of, making the line passes free. Â The sky tower at night is a real treat. Â Our favorite was the sea lions that you can feed dead fish. Â Learn the truth about the good that SeaWorld does for marine animals through rescue and rehabilitation. Â This is a must go place in SD."
1823,6/30/2013,2,"90 minutes into our first visit, our 9 year old said, ""This really isn't that fun."" That was after I spent $467 for four annual passes.Shamu is undeniably entertaining and impressive. But there is a definite sense that everything else exists because of Shamu, and exists to somehow give the impression that there is more to this place than Shamu. There isn't much else.Sea world is a study in how not to run an amusement park. We were lost in the parking lot immediately. There are hardly any signs in or outside. We spent a lot of time wandering around, often feeling like we were lost or in employee only area. Before noon we were so thirsty we spent 15 minutes trying to find refreshments, only to discover two places were entirely out of all soda drinks but didn't even post signs on the machines, so we stand there stupidly trying to figure it out.This place isn't really that fun. Next time I'm buying an ipad."
1824,5/7/2012,3,"THE ENTIRE PARK SMELLS LIKE AN AQUARIUM!!yep.but that is to be expected, no?Parking is $14Military gets in free, and so do up to three dependents (must have the dependent ID cards)It's not a place you can spend a couple days seeing, it's more like a one day trip and then check out the rest of SD.There are rides and aquariums which are neat.I am not a fan because it's just TOO touristy and not educational enough for my taste, but to each their own.Also, I'm 26 with no kids, so that affects my rating of this place (obviously)"
1825,3/16/2009,3,"My co-worker and i were talking about Sea World.. It then occurred to me I never made a Yelp review for this place.. it's a sign of an addiction when a topic or place is brought up.. and Yelp reviews are the first thing that comes to mind.. Anyway.. last year I had a Fun Card.. you know.. the whole ""buy a day.. get the rest of the year for free..""I went three times.. once with my friends.. once with my family.. and once with my boyfriend..I think I only enjoyed it the first two times because it was with different sets of people so we were able to watch the shows and it was new to them.. The third time I went was overkill.. and we really only went for their awesome funnel cake.. the best funnel cake next to Knott's.. and way way way better than Disneylands.. The shows are fun.. and the displays are interesting and the animals are always great to see..If you are an animal lover.. you'd love it here.. but just don't go more than once a year.. it does get kind of old.. and the shows are always the same..I think in the summer they do these fun night shows.. but I didn't experience those..Just go for the funnel cake!"
1826,10/18/2009,5,"Seaworld's the BEST!Came here last August with my boyfriend. We had a blast! Being huge animal lovers, this place was a great experience. Last time I came here was when I was 5, but I felt like a kid still! We were able to take a private 1 hour tour with the penguins; we got to feed the sea lions & dolphins, pet the bat rays, & learn more about animals. That one water ride Shipwreck Rapids seriously got me SOAKED & the kids on the ride couldn't stop laughing at us b/c for some reason, we were the target the entire ride. It was fun. This is a must-go especially for first timers, animal lovers, kids. I'd come back here over and over again. Next summer I'm taking my son with me; I wanna do the beluga interaction tour!!!"
1827,11/2/2009,5,"Did you know that killer whales, like Shamu, can consume up to 250 lbs. of food a day? Â Last week, I drove to San Diego to see all my favorite creatures from under the sea....and some from above (the sea, that is). Â From polar bears to penguins, SeaWorld has always captured my heart and my imagination with their zoo of animals and corny music that causes heart-wrenching love for all things cuddly. Â At my website Â is my assortment of favorite pictures that I shot while traversing the park. Â If you're wondering where the Budweiser and clydesdales are, don't panic. Â They are still there at SeaWorld, I just ran out of time. Â Afterall, SeaWorld closed at 5pm the day I was there."
1828,9/4/2013,5,"I love this place. Â It's not too large so it's a manageable day. Â The food is good for amusement park fare. Â And if you visit on a weekday, the crowds are small and you don't have to deal with a bunch of obnoxious 14 year olds. Â I visit every time I come to San Diego."
1829,7/21/2011,2,"I went here last week before I had to start summer school, and I was a little disappointed. I was mainly looking forward to the Shamu show, and when we went, we got pretty decent seats. When it finally started, I thought it was pretty boring because 2/3 of the time they sang and talked about saving the earth and everything. The people didn't even go in with the whales, and they just danced a little. Actually no. They just waved their arms and fed the whales fish. That's about it. There weren't many good places to eat either. I liked that the gondola ride was free, but right after we got off, thy ha to close it down because it was windy. One star to Gondola ride.Another for 1/2 off popcorn because we brought our own Sea World Bucket."
1830,7/26/2015,1,"Terrible terrible terrible. From start to finish. Lets start with parking. I got stuck far....so the walk alone was a journey with no trams. I figured food was going to be expensive which it was...nit even reasonable anywhere so I bought my son a all day dining pass which seems ideal for a day. As busy as we were I did not redeem his pass till about 340pm. I went to cafe 64 which was a 1 minute walk from guest services where I redeemed it. I stood in line for 115 minutes!!! It was unbelievable! Then come to find out he only gets a choice of a hot dog or a kids chicken nuggets which turns out to be 4 pieces of chicken pebbles. I realy couldnt believe it. I was out by 520 which made me miss the shamoo show. I went back to guest service's to try and refund and they just didnt want to deal with it....no refunds. It was really upsetting. No comps.....more like.....wow thats sucks kinda attitude. So decided not to go back to any sorts of these restaurants because my son was still hungry. We waited in line for the smaller food carts and 3 spots literally had NO ICE and 1 self service was kept serving flat soda.....and no one fixed it going over 2 hours...I know cause I went back to the same spot and it was still down.....no signs....nothing. this park was unorganized. ..take your money and run. With all the bad publicity this place got from Black fish you think they step it up somewhere. Â Its more like...holy shit we are going broke now so rip as many people as you can before we pull the plug team! My recommendation. .....dont go. Look it up online......its much more entertaining. Â Sorry sea world. I am NEVER coming back again. You took my $700 I spent in 1 day and thats all youll ever get. I will forever down play your name and encourage people not to ever go. Thank you for the terrible time. Oh yeah........my 3 hour journey home was the most pleasent feeling. Finally out of your horrible park. And by the way. Please make more exits......1 exits...20,000 cars= bottleneck effect you dummies"
1831,4/7/2013,4,"Let me start off by saying that I generally HATE rides like this. Yoou either stay dry on the hot days or get soaked on the cold days and ride like this are generally pretty boring. Shipwreck Rapids and Grizzly River Run at Disney's California Adventure are the complete opposite. This ride was really fun and had a lot of theming to go with the soaking we experienced. It was a pretty chilly day (in the 60s and cloudy), but we still had fun. The line wasn't at all bad. We wished that we were provided with free lockers to use during the ride so our stuff wouldn't get ruined, but we were smart and brought Ziplock bags for our electronics. Overall, we had a lot fo fun on this ride and I won't be opposed to riding it in the future."
1832,4/8/2011,5,"This review is unique due to the fact that I was a teacher chaperone on a Group Camp with my middle school students. I have been on many a field trip, but this was the most impressive school trip I could imagine. The two day/two night trip was organized and incredibly fun for both students and teachers. We stayed in the SeaWorld dorms and were given many behind-the-scenes tours as well as access to all the shows and exhibits. The tour guides/counselors were fabulous with our students and extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. The SeaWorld park is a lot of fun and a great place to spend a day, but I cannot say enough about our wonderful overnight camp experience. What a professional, well organized program! Thank you SeaWorld!"
1833,12/26/2011,4,We Went There For Christmas!!!It Wasn't Too Busy Or Crowded As You Might Expect. Â At Least Not Elbow To Elbow Like Universal Studios Or Disneyland At The Same Time.My Son Loved Watching The Dolphins And Killer Whales Jumping And Splashing Everyone...Yes We Did Sit In The Splash Zone But Only Got Droplets...The Underwater Aquariums Were Great!!! Â You Had A Bette View Of All The Ocean Life Than Watching Them From Above...This In My Book Is A Plus Since My Son Kept Running To The Glass And Pointing At Everything Swimming Around!!! Â When You Can Keep A 2 Year Interested And Excited You're Alright In My Book!!!The Only Problem Is That Most Of The The Employees (NOT The Trainers) Weren't Too Happy working A Holiday Weekend. Â They Were RUDE!!! Â They Knew They Were Going To Work This Weekend They Should Have Requested The Day Off Or Call In Sick!!!And They Had Snow In Arctic World For The Kids to Play In!!! Â My Son Had A Blast With The Snow!!! Â The Older Kids 5 And Above Could Sled Down A Little Hill. Â The Other Kids Were Just Playing In The Snow having Snow Ball Fight Or Making Snow Men...
1834,10/31/2011,3,"I went to Sea World this past Saturday and it was all that I had expected. It was A-ok for the price we paid because they do have enough activities/shows to fill up the entire day. But BEWARE! The food is absolutely horrendous anywhere in the park. I suggest packing sandwiches or snacks to have throughout the day. We had the most disgusting paninis at Island Pete's and they were $10! I get spending a lot for food at an amusement park, but at least make it edibile. Take your own food in, they don't really check or else you'll end up spending a fortune on disgusting food."
1835,6/20/2012,5,"My wife and I love this place!! Â We love the ocean and anything that is in it! Â Sea World is a great combination of a zoo and a theme park. Â It has a lot of fun rides, shows, and walk through exhibits to keep people entertained for days! Â it is a lot of fun to feed the dolphins and totally worth the money you have to pay for itThe Shamoo show was a blast as well! I recommend sitting in the splash zone. Â It was an extremely hot day and it was so refreshing to get soaked by a huge whale!Make sure you check out the new dolphin show as well! It is so entertaining and has you on your seat the entire time!I can't wait to go back!"
1836,4/8/2015,4,"We received free preschool passes for our 5 and 3 year olds so hubby and I bought passes. Ended up being 166.00 for all four of us to have passes until 12/31/15, seems like a great deal to me! We went once so far. Our girls loved the sesame street area and the rides. We saw the ray touch tank, the penguins, the wild arctic exhibit, the barn, the flamingos, and lots more - LOVED IT ALL! I think we will realistically go back another eight times so I am happy about these passes. The food doesn't seem that expensive, and I like that there is a food plan available (one flat price per day and you can eat all day in select restaurants). I like that they sell beer. I like that there is so much walking around between the exhibits. The souvenirs are not that expensive (most are actually reasonably and not pieces of junk!) so we are starting a reward system at home for our kids to earn a new toy each visit. WINNING!"
1837,12/5/2011,4,"I am so in love with Sea Lions and Seals....personally I think they are named incorrectly....I prefer Sea Dogs.Everytime I look at them they remind me of my old cocker spaniel....and they bark ...so cute....all the old guys here are rescues...they wouldnt survive out at Sea....the main reason I come here is to look at the Sea Lions...not much makes me happier....not sure what it is but i could stand there all day and watch them, a sense of peace comes over me....I think the last time I was there I spent about $80 on stinky fish to feed me little friends...I hold a season pass mainly to visit the Sea Lions but in addition I always enjoy the Shamu show...On the down side I wish they still had FlamingosHighly recommend not eating here though...save your stomach space and head to World Famous in Pacific Beach....if you must have something here...then go to the ice cream shop in front and buy a mega huge sunday, those are yummy."
1838,6/26/2015,4,"We had a blast here! Â Get there early, go on the rides right away! Â We were able to go on a few times in a row before lines started forming. See the shows! Â  They are fantastic. Â Food prices - not so good as you can imagine. Â Pack your cooler - pay the extra $5.00 for premium parking - and go to your car for lunch."
1839,5/2/2011,3,"I have so many mixed emotions about my SeaWorld experience... Â I have been coming here since I was a kid and have always been in love with this place.Returning this year, things seemed a bit more... boring. Â =( Â We came during the week and there wasn't much of a crowd. Â That was the great part as there were very short lines and you could actually see most of the exhibits. Â My yawning came from the shows.While I will say that Clyde & Seymour seem to be the most entertaining, that isn't exactly a positive for a place known for it's killer whale show. Â The Dolphin show was just okay. Â They've added a bunch of acrobats to the show but it seems as if the dolphins do less now...I viewed the Shamu show twice, hoping that the second viewing would have a little more spark... Â Sadly, it didn't. Â I know that part of their boringness (yes I said it) is due to the fact that they have had to scale back the show. Â Trainers are no longer getting in the water with the whales and it has basically become a show of them flipping and splashing folks in rows 1-16 (yawn). Â Maybe they will make some updates come summer as the show is REALLY boring. Â It is still a magical experience to see such large animals trained, but they almost seem like they'd be better off in the wild. Â Food was a bit high in price and gross in taste but you kind of expect it!"
1840,12/11/2014,1,"All my childhood years I never knew what went on behind the scenes of this, what I thought, was such a wonderful place to go see all these beautiful sea animals. Even up until last year I had no idea what went on, so my significant other and I decided to invest in a annual pass since it was so cheap. We went a total of two times just so we could finish up looking at the entire park. Then I heard about and watched Black Fish. Wow. After watching that documentary I realized Sea World is an evil place. Then I remembered our last visit to the park, we watched the last showing of the Shamu Show. It was night time by the time it was over. I was so awe struck at how great the orcas are that before we headed to the gates to leave, I wanted to get a last glimpse of them. There was a barred off area where you could see the back of the aquarium tank where the orcas are kept before the shows. I stood there staring at one with its dorsal fin curled downwards staring at the wall of the aquarium tank and I just got hit with a feeling of sadness. The orca must be so miserable being kept captive in a small tank as opposed to being able to swim freely in the large ocean. Since then, I have signed many petitions and have become anti Sea World. They are a horrible industry who are only in it for the money using wild animals for pure entertainment. Never going back there nor will I take my future kid(s)."
1841,6/18/2014,2,"Well, I have lived in San Diego for years and this was my first time to visit a very famous seaworld. There was a reason for me not to go there. Now I know why. Let's start with the whole parking situation. $16.00! Seriously? For my car to sit on the parking lot for 4 hours and me walking for a half a mile to get to the park I had to pay $16!!!! Don't they make enough money already by selling overpriced food that taste nasty and you have to stand in line for for 30 minutes?! For kids to see a whale show or feed sea lions tickets are extremely expensive! Yes, if you live in SD and you have kids, it does make sense to purchase a pads with parking, but if you are visiting, not everyone can afford California sight seeing prices. Anyway, my visit to the wonderful land of sea was ok overall. Will I go there again?! NO!!!"
1842,7/10/2013,3,"This was my first time at Sea World, and I think I had my AHA moment. I was sitting in this big stadium, waiting for the whale show to start, when it hit me. I felt very bad for these whales ( all of the animals at Sea World) because these animals are being used to entertain us, humans, which was not the reason for them to be in this world. Â Besides that, the food is overpriced (as always at places like that), and so are the tickets."
1843,7/23/2012,4,"I recently purchased an investment property in San Diego, so we needed to come over here and get things set up. The kids wanted to go to Sea World so I gave in and we went. I really enjoyed it. The tickets were $73 each. $25 for VIP parking and food was expensive, but this is all to be expected with you are going out to a park! I'd return."
1844,4/3/2013,4,"This place was so much fun! Last time I was here was 9 years ago! I don't know why I waited so long lolFirst of all, I bought the San Diego 2013 Fun Card Â through a company where my aunt works. I know online the funcard detail Â says ""pay for a single day, and get all year free"" that's not necessarily true. Even though you purchase a Funcard it will say ""1 day admission"" on the back of it. I called sea world guest services to find out what to do with the ticket because I wanted to be able to go the whole year. They told me to go to guest services once I'm in and switch out the ticket. BUT she didn't inform me that there was a $7 fee for every ticket to make it all year round, so be aware of that. So make sure when going into seaworld with tickets in hand don't stand in any of the booth lines, just go where you get your tickets scanned and you pass right through on your right hand side after passing the checkpoint where they search your bags. then go to guest services, pay and get your year round passes!So that was my minus 1 star, wish I could've known where to go ( there were no signs or info for some lines, had to find an employee to help me) because it would've saved me 30 minutes of standing in line for what I thought was guest services. It's just hard to know when It's over crowded where to go for your needs.The Shamu show was cute, a lil slow but good. Couldn't help but feel sad for the whales though :(The Blue Horizon Show was my favorite! gotta be in the wet zone! The Sea Lions LIVE show had me laughing suprisingly. this guy dances to songs meanwhile other staff is getting ready haha. Cute show!The Pets show was great! I loved that they first do competition between dogs and they kinda get sidetracked, its so funny! I really enjoyed the show when the animals weren't being told to do anyting,they were just running around and playing a show!I actually went on a chilly/ bit windy day. At first I regretted bringing shorts, but Â sitting down to see shows waiting a good 25 minutes to get good seats you could feel the sun blazing. I can't imagine it on a really hot day so make sure to bring sunblock,hat, and sunglasses it'll save your butt!* bring your own poncho if you do want to get in the wet zone because they sell em there for $8"
1845,6/19/2015,1,i really loved this place in the past but they are getting one star for the fact that i cant get anyone on the phone to answer a simple question. Â it has been 3 days any every time i call its longer than an hour wait. Â My whole company WAS going to come here for the day or possibly rent the park out but since i cannot reach a live person to ask a simple question we will be taking our business elsewhere.
1846,3/15/2011,4,"I really love Sea World! Â  For this review however I'll talk about some of the things I did not like.1. The Shamu show - I guess since the accidental death of the trainer, the Shamu show just doesn't seem as exciting. Â The trainers no longer swim with the Killer Whales, and the show almost seems boring to me now.2. The Blue Horizons Dolphin Show - seems like they're trying to mimic cirque du solei with the performers dressed in costumes and diving into the water, except it's much more boring. Â Other than that, I really enjoyed this place. Â Don't forget to check out the ""Pet's Rule"" animal show. Â Who knew that the best show at Sea World would be a show with dogs, cats, pigs in it!"
1847,12/14/2012,1,"I went to this park on vacation with a free military ticket. I had never been to SeaWorld. Â I learned a lot...the tanks WAY are too small, and it is not educational in the slightest. More like a circus. I expected more like a great aquarium, and I received splashing, but no info on the animals. These people make the animals splash for your dollars. After doing a lot of research on SeaWorld, I have since joined the movement to free orcas and dolphins from captivity. Orcas are extremely intelligent, family-oreinted, apex predators that should never be kept in captivity. They are WAY too big for those tanks, and so are the dolphins. Don't give your money to these people. Sea World is responsible for hundreds of dolphin and whale deaths occurring during capture. Capture of killer whales has been banned in most countries (including USA) because it is so cruel. Captivity cuts their lifespan in half. The fallen, curved dorsal fins--that only occurs in captivity.Highly recommend you read ""Death at Sea World, the Dark Side of Killer Whales in Captivity"" by David Kirby before you decide to go. Â Or, Youtube ""Free LoLita"" before you decide, and you'll understand where I'm coming from. I'm not a crazy animal rights person. I eat meat. I have thought about this long and hard...besides humans, these are the most intelligent creatures on earth. We have no right to capture them and stick them in crappy tanks, and make them perform for a circus until they die. SeaWorld makes tremendous profits from ticket sales, so they lie to you about what really is happening with the orcas and dolphins. Seriously, google it. For those of you wondering why the trainers don't get in the water anymore...there have been several instances of the whales killing the trainers during the show. Many more injured. Attacks on humans really don't occur in the wild.Google it.These animals were made by God for the open ocean, not tanks. Take your kids on a whale watching tour instead to see them in the wild. It is more educational and cheaper too. Do not give your money to these people. They don't educate us, they expliot our natural world for money.Oh, and the food there is really terrible. Worst park food I've ever tried."
1848,6/19/2011,1,"Spending over an hour and half in line to buy food is unacceptable. Â The management is totally unable to serve food. Â As I stood in line while my family could go and enjoy the park without me, I observed some type of manager come in and observe the situation. Â So for them to say that they are unaware of the issue is totally false. Â When you read their map, there are 5 venues that serve meal food and 10 ""featured shopping"" venues.So my recommendation is to Eat Before you Go and/or take a cooler full of food in your car. Â You by an all day pass so you can go and come as you wish."
1849,7/31/2016,1,"Absolutely horrible. My family visited Saturday July 30th, 2016. They claim to be handicap friendly, which they absolutely are not. Just because you have a couple ramps and a few wheelchair seats does not mean you are handicap friendly. Trying to figure out the Disabled ride pass is impossible, not mention you have to essentially pass a test to see if you even qualify for the pass. Last I checked you can't be asked to prove you are disabled! Their guest service is disgusting. Justin from Shipwreck Rapids is flat out disrespectful, we were trying to figure a few things out with him about the access pass, he was blatantly rude, not only to my family but to several other families as well. When we asked him to please help us, he refused then acted like he was going to, the Â changed his mind and said ""forget this, I'm going in my break, not my problem"" His manager happened to walk up behind me shortly after I demanded he get ahold of a manager, which he refused to do. The manager was little help as well, although she was much nicer. Seaworld, very seriously needs to reevaluate there ride operations, especially when it comes to handicapped passes. They also need to train there staff on guest service. During our day, we did not run in to ONE SINGLE helpful person, everyone was mad and didn't want to be bothered. By 5pm I couldn't find a concessions stand that had ICE of all things ice Â When asked if they could please refill the ice dispenser I was ignored, so we're several other people. When asked again, we were rudely informed they were out of ICE. Ridiculous. We became trapped on Journey to Atlantis for over 10 minutes in the elevator part, maintenance walked past us several times. The majority of us requested to be taken off the ride, because we no longer felt safe, they ignored us! We even tried yelling. The ride operator then came over the loud speaker and asked that every one give a thumbs up if they were good to rode once it came back on. LESS THAN 30 % OF THE RIDERS GAVE A THUMBS UP. SEVERAL OF THE RIDERS CONTINUED TO YELL THAT THEY WANTED OFF, WE EVEN BEGGED THE MAINTENANCE MAN, AND WE KNOW HE WAS THERE, WE COULD SEE HIS FLASH LIGHT Â we were ignored. I will be calling corporate or whatever higher up I can find Monday morning. I will never step foot in this place again. Never."
1850,4/8/2016,5,Had a blast at SeaWorld... Got on all the rides and saw all the attractions... I have nothing negative to say about this place. I always have a great time when I visit from Los Angeles...
1851,5/20/2011,5,So I must reduce my stars because Seaworld is kind of a sad place to be if you really think about it. And they are kind of small. And they would not upgrade my boyfriend's pass to a fun card. It is depressing to stare at Shamu (or whatever this whale is called now) swimming around in his big boring tank without anything for him to do. Round and round he goes... Big white boring tank with no fun things to do. Until they purchase Mission Bay and rope that off for Shamu I will not be satisfied. Oh and the new dolphin show is ridiculous. And not in a good way.
1852,9/11/2013,3,"Decided to come here last minute because we were in the area and the weather was nice. Â Paid about $72 a ticket with AAA discount at the kiosk. Was very surprised this park still attracts visitors as there was a good amount of people during our visit. Â The fun started off slow but as the day progressed and as we got to see live exhibits and what not, it definitely improved. Â I was also very impressed with how the dolphins and whales obey the trainers commands, was very amazed. Â Sad though I didn't get to ride on any rollercoasters.."
1853,8/7/2013,5,"Worth the $79 admission! loved every minute, what an experience and what a surprise being able to pet dolphins, rays, and anneminies!"
1854,6/22/2011,2,"I used to come here every year with my family (age 4-10). The shows were corny but enjoyable. My favorite shows were the dolphins, shamu, and symore and clyde show. I just went recently (now age 20) with my boyfriend and it was his first time. I was so excited because he loves fish and sea turtles and just animals in general. We first went on the Atlantis ride which was pretty cool..didnt get wet. Phew...haha. Oh yeah make sure you plan your schedule well because shows are Â according to time. Sometimes (for example) you would have to go to the other side of the park to seee Shamu and then walk all teh way back to catch the Pet show. Something like that.Okay the big disappoint was that the shows were so lame. Everything got cornier and it was mainly seeing the fish splashing water at kids and people doing acrobats. Dont get me wrong...they did a great job, but just that I expected more than just corny jokes and fish jumping out of the water three four times. I hope San diego zoo would be more entertaining...i mean its gonna be like starring at animals but i dont know...we'll see."
1855,1/3/2015,2,"This was my first time at Sea World in decades, and admittedly my young kids loved it, but there is just so much wrong with this place. Â Beyond the obvious questionable practices of bribing beautiful large sea animals with treats to perform on command, the whole place just seems a bit off. Â Service is pretty poor in general and staff seem disinterested/disengaged. Â Food is awful even by theme park standards, and a total rip off with stupid long lines just to get pizza and hot dogs. Â Shows feel the need to throw in tons of ""we save the animals"" publicity/propaganda which while I'm sure in part true just feels over done. Â They charge for everything and you just feel constantly gouged, whether it's the parking fees or paying extra to park close, all the extra cups/straw accessories at check-out, $ to feed animals, on top of pricey admission fees. Â Animal exhibits are impressive, but with nearly zero information compared to the zoo so little for kids to learn. Â I'm hoping I don't have to make the trip back again any time soon. Â Sea World definitely needs some new management to re-imagine the future of this place."
1856,7/10/2012,3,"Clean, green, and nice environment. All rides, it takes more than 2 hours waiting in long lines for 5min rides.They should follow Universal studio's model.-4D theater: Â get wet with those tiny little bit of water? come on."
1857,8/9/2015,5,"We go to Seaward about 10+ times a year and love it! Â We get 2-year passes that include the parking and take my 8-year daughter a few hours after school and see all the ""special"" activities. Â Great place!"
1858,11/14/2011,5,"Love it! Â My wife and I had the chance to visit Sea World this past weekend, and had a blast.The ONLY thing that was bad about the weekend was the weather. Â There was an unbelievable amount of rain, but we didn't let that stop us! Â We high tailed it to the gift shop and purchased a couple of ponchos and off we went!We saw the killer whale show which was magnificent. Â Best of all we were able to feed, and play with the dolphins. Â If you have an opportunity to do that - MAKE SURE YOU DO! Â It was fantastic."
1859,11/18/2015,2,"Everything is an up-sale at the is place. Â For example, my wife and I bought a drink cup for $16.99 and were promised 99 cent refills. Â The very next time we came back the lady said nope the price has gone Â up to $1.99, I was like really you guys just told me it was 99 cents. Â Overall the experience is lacking, 75% of the park is food vendors, gift shops, and carnival games, so it feels like you're paying to shop. Â BTW I could care less about the black-fish controversy, if I was stuck in a cage I would probably nibble on a trainer too."
1860,12/23/2013,3,"I like Sea World a lot.However, last time I was there I was very disappointed.The employees didn't seem to want to be there at all!The Shipwreck Cafe' gave my niece's meal away to another kid who ordered after us and then when my sister went to retrieve it they told her they already gave it to her.They made us another one but still.They closed early because it was ""slow"" and we had only been there for an hour and a half.Then on our way out I wanted a bottle of water for the road and the booth I went to was a coffee bar as well and this customer ordered like five specialty coffees and there was only one staff member ""working"" there even though there were other employees.I worked at the zoo over the summer at a snack bar so it's hard for me to complain about customer service since I know what it's like but this was unacceptable.I love the rides though and the penguin and shark encounters!"
1861,10/5/2010,4,"Boy ""So what shall we do for Labor Day weekend??? Sea World???""Me ""Erm...uhhh...eckk...hmmm....I guesso.""So as a last minute trip we decided to try to do something during our 3 day weekend and ended up coming here. Figured it would be crazy, but at the least it would be a lot of kids and I'm just tall enough to see over the little ones at least. And the last time I went to a Sea World was when I was 12!Indeed it was as predicted...there were kids everywhere!!!! But Sea World isn't the type of place you line up for things, you walk, you watch, you wait. So didn't turn out so badly, but hated all the ways they are trying to get extra money out of you. Ergh...I guess every amusement park is like this now. Still checked out a lot of cool stuff and enjoyed my day.Highlights:Shamu show!!! Still the best show! Hahaha It's amazing how these killer whales can jump so high and I felt so sorry for the people in the splash zone! So sad that 2 days after I went one killer whale got sick and died. :( Sad...Blue Horizons-Eh....it was kinda cool but I think I really wanted to see the animals perform rather than the people. Haha plus I didn't really care for the story they had in this.Ugly orange Shamu cup-I didn't want a huge Shamu topper so I got the orange cup instead...but it saved me lots of money on refills.Blubbery Gross Walrus-In the Artic area we saw a bunch of people crowded around one area. We tiptoed and tried to find another vantage point and finally saw a tail. I cried out ""Manatee!"" then realized I was in the wrong part of the world. When we finally got through the crowd, its face was right up against the glass...it was huge...blubbery...and well kinda disgusting. It was in the process of eating a fish...as in regurgitating it and then swallowing and then regurgitating... etc etc.Funny Penguins-The penguins outside were so cute and oh so smelly. There were some cute ones huddled together underneath bushes and one that looked like it just fell over. Poor things prolly were dying in the Cali heat.Stingrays-If you buy food, these guys will come right up to you and you can pet them. Pretty funny cause sometimes you'll see them just swim right on top of each other to get food.Starfish and urchin pool-Pick them up and toss em back...just kidding on the 2nd part...ahem....gently put them back in the water. Kept wondering if the urchin was good to eat though...mmmm unii...So while the really fun stuff you have to pay for now and there were wayyy wayyy too many kids here, its still very possible to have lotsa fun after all! I'm not as fascinated as when I was a kid, but I guess years down the line I might be bringing my future kids here."
1862,1/27/2011,4,"Awesome experienced!We planned ahead and look on the internet for their show schedule and manage to made to every single show, petting zone, and a few rides and tours =)Favorite show is the Shamu: Believe! Is too bad that the trainers can't go in the water with them anymore...They are huge sea creatures!! Â I was sitting all the way up row 12 and they still manage to splash me! lol I was all soaked!Blue Horizon, not too bad... it sort of made up for the human-animal interaction part that the Shamu show doesn't provide anymore...However, half way thru the show I was wondering to myself if I was watching a Dolphin show or watching a diving show...?other good spot to hit: Pets Rule!, Sea Lion Live, Shipwreck Rapids, Wild Arctic, Journey to Atlantic, Penguin Encounter !!Parking is $12"
1863,10/5/2010,4,"The Facts of Sea World:I cried at the Shamu Show.I got an awesome Shamu cup.Saw a seal and an sea otter perform a Halloween act.I saw more Affliction shirts than I needed to on many dads.I saw an 8 y/o child dressed in a wench costume....way to start 'em young there, mom.The food is absolutely terrible.Bringing extra clothes was an awesome idea (I was drenched from head to toe)."
1864,12/6/2009,5,"I take my daughter here at least twice a year. It's a well organized house of fun, learning and retail. Bring an extra set of clothing and a towel to ride the water rides or sit front row and get splashed by Shamu. Eat before coming... the food is very ordinary. By the time you get hungry, you can leave and go eat some of the great food nearby."
1865,1/29/2012,4,"There is an Seaworld app that you can download and it will give you park information at your fingertips. Â It tells you when all the shows are happening, and even acts like a GPS so you can easily maneuver throughout the park. Â I enjoyed the polar bear and beluga whale exhibit. Â It's super cold, though, so make sure to bring a sweater.We went to 3 shows--the Sea Lion show, the dolphin show, and the Shamu show. Â The best by far was the Sea Lion show--there was comedy and fun entertainment. Â The dolphin show was so crowded that so many people were standing and blocking the view. Â It was so hard to really see anything. Â The Shamu show was short and not that surprising. Â I was waiting for something more to happen and it just didn't.We also went on the ride, Journey to Atlantis, which I know is not a new ride, but it was my first time. Â Make sure to sit in the 3rd or 4th row because you get totally soaked if you sit in the first 2 rows."
1866,6/27/2014,3,I just wasted one and a half hours in line because the ride got stuck and we still did not go it was a pain But Shamu was fun I'm not going here soon it was just a pain
1867,7/6/2011,3,"I'm thinking that if you've never seen something like this before or are a kid, this is definitely at least a four star experience and you should go and see it. To me, who've been to this type of amusement park several times, it was okay. The salt water aquarium displays were meh. The polar bear and penguin exhibit were spectacular. I think the main draw is obviously Shamu. Watching those massive creatures jump into the air with such ease was exciting and beautiful. A couple of the smaller shows have a Cirque du Soleil-type theme to them. It was more Cirque than animals plus I'm not much of Cirque fan, so it was just alright for me.One thing to definitely remember is the sunscreen because I got burnt as hell here. There really isn't any shade and I usually never get that burnt, but I'd suggest using SPF 105."
1868,5/23/2015,5,"Don't get caught in the lies that some say about SeaWorld. Â SeaWorld continues to give first rate care to these animals and does wonderful work inside and outside the park. Â If you want to see this first hand I would highly recommend one of animal tours or maybe even a camp if you have children. Â If not if you want a relaxing, inspirational, and fun day, you really can't go wrong with SeaWorld."
1869,8/5/2015,4,"I was shocked to see some of the shows at Sea World went (Disney) style. The Cirque stuff is done to death so I didn't care for the Dolphin show even though it was very entertaining for my kids. The Ski show is no longer there? Booo.... And replaced with a Cirque show. I'm from Vegas and kinda over the same acts, so I'm being over critical. The food was surprisingly priced fairly for a theme park, I thought for sure it was going to be double the cost it was. Â The roller coasters were fast and fun, wait wasn't terrible and they had covering for most of the wait. The memorabilia was priced fair. I was disappointed at the Shamu show, none of the trainers get in the water anymore. I worked 2 years at San Antonio Sea World and that Killer whale show was awesome! I guess Sea World is being scrutinized for the treatment of animals, and it shows when you see the performances! They took a huge step back and don't have the strong shows they used to. I've now been to everyone of their parks and San Diego is a great family day!"
1870,7/25/2015,4,"Me and the family had a blast at sea world yesterday, I haven't been in quite a few years. The family had a blast. MANTA holly cow it is a short ride but well worth the wait in line. Ship wreck rapids awesome and so nice to be able to cool off a bit, it was very hot. Cirque de le mar was my favorite show it was a fun and entertaining show. My only disappointed for the day was the Shamu show, the show is nothing anymore ""F#%C"" blackfish and protesters it used to be my favorite show there. This time I was take it or leave it didn't really feel like the trainers needed to be anything more than a high school cheerleader to run the show. Last but not least for Â anyone that is planning on spending the entire day at Sea World, make sure you get the all day eating wrist band. It is so worth the 30.00 (on line) and 37.00 (in park) and you get all the waters you can drink. All in all I will definitely be coming back to sea world in the future."
1871,1/22/2012,3,Went during May of 2011 and I was hoping for a bit more to be quite honest. Is it just me or did the shows get cut in half??? The wife and I went while she was pregnant and we still had a good time even though we couldn't get on the majority of the rides. I'm sure when our son gets a bit older and we take him for his 1st time I'll want the shows to hurry up anyways! ;)Either way it is a cool park if you have kids but on this particular day it was just the wife and I so hopefully next time I can give it at least a 4 after my son is able to go.
1872,1/26/2011,5,"If you live in San Diego you sometimes take sea world for granted. Sea world is probably our biggest tourist attraction. I used to enjoy it more as a child, but now my nephews enjoy it to. Definitely better than lego land. They also have a water slide ride for groups of families. Food here its quite expensive and I suggest to eat a meal prior. There's a bbq restaurant that serves decent bbq plates also if you are hungry at night. My nephews just loved the polar bears and dolphins. The penguins were real adorable. The stuffed penguins were expensive also, so I skipped that."
1873,8/23/2011,4,"Great place for a little one, as long as you don't stay too long. Â We have year long passes which is great so you don't feel pressured to see everything in one day. Â Way too many strollers in the place, it can hurt when you get clipped by someone not paying attention.We noticed this time a lot of teenagers there...just kinda odd.Shows on a Saturday fill up quickly, so make sure to get a seat 20-30 minutes before it starts."
1874,3/11/2012,4,"Get the pass, for 60 bucks or whatever it is for AAA members, it's well worth it. Â We rode out bikes there and avoided the parking fee - yeah!! Â there are some nice pike paths around the park as well. Â So many shows and exhibits that we didn't see everything on one day. Â Pay $7 to feed the sea lions, they were adorable. Â I love them. Â The penguins were also adorable, but their area was smelly like whatever kind of fish they feed those guys. We saw Blue Horizons, but I have heard all of the shows are good. Â None of the food options seemed that good. Â We opted to duck out early and have lunch in Old Town."
1875,10/17/2010,3,"I was seriously SUPER excited to revisit Sea World but I was sort of disappointed and I will tell you why....first the GOOD....-Moray Eel tank was still a winner-Ray touch tank was good-LARGE groupers were still there-Freshwater fish area was stocked pretty well with Gars and other interesting african/south american fish-Penguin area was still cool with the many different kinds of penguins.-The pet/animal show was funny and the animals did some amazing stuff.Ok....now the BAD-The Shamu show was somewhat slow and not as much ""tricks"" with the trainers (maybe due to the very tragic trainer incident)-The dolphin show turned into a strange cirque du solei (sp?) show. Â I want to see some dolphins when I go to a dolphin show and you know what...it wasn't to me....-Rides were all closed due to a thunder storm in the distance (not their fault)-The beer garden was not there and seemed to be that Busch is not a sponsor of the park anymore since I didn't see much of their logos around the park. Â I was looking forward to this since I didn't really see it the last time.Overall, I would not visit this park again unless something is done to make it better or there is someone that is dying to go that happens to be on vacation with us. Â A hui hou Sea World....."
1876,12/16/2011,4,"Hubby and I came here in 2009, we are going back again in the next couple of weeks as we have visitors. We have been to both this Seaworld and the one in Florida. Whilst the one in Florida is bigger, I actually preferred this one.Hubby left me outside the park in the morning to head into the park on my own. Yes I looked like a loser. He had to go see some people.I walked around on my own until he got to the park about 1pm, I did not get bored. I got to see most of the attractions and watched one show.Once hubby got there we had some food (it was not great and was expensive but then that is only to be expected) then watched a couple of shows and went on Atlantis.There was enough to fill the whole day. Or you can do it quickly if you prefer. I think now that I live here I need to get a year pass! I love this place. Â The only reason it is not a 5 star is the expensive food and drink and that there is no shade, it is easy to get burnt here even if you are wearing sunscreen."
1877,7/25/2011,5,I go every 6 months or so with my anual pass and I sure find it different and fun every single time! I mean what else would u expect! The Shamu show by far the best. I mean they are all so very different and unique in their own way. The pet show is a funny one!Thumbs up and its perfect for kids and adults
1878,1/22/2013,2,"From being here as a kid to now, I could say that SeaWorld is pretty much... boring.I mean, it was always fun as a kid, but now it's just dull. Their shows are always the same: Big sea mammals jumping around and performing tricks and splashing water at people, no matter how ""new."" I could care less about their ""new"" Sesame Street park. What, did SeaWorld decide to buy some of Sesame Street and advertise it on full blast? I couldn't be arsed to even think of finding out, but either way, it's kind of stupid. Arctic Thunder, as we know it, is of course, a simulation ride. It was very exciting as a child, but it's not so exciting. Whenever I went to SeaWorld for the Shamu Show (now ""Believe."" Believe in what? A bunch of orca jumping around and splashing water at people? Believe the fact that after reading these reviews I have learned nothing valuable about them?), I always was in question about the ""wilting"" fins on the orca. It didn't look natural, to me: I always thought it was of age, but... how?Also, other shows like ""Pets Rule!,"" ""Sea Lion and Otter Show,"" ""Cirque De La Mer,"" and all the others I didn't think about are the same ol' thing. Monotony at its best. As much as their slight humor takes place, it's always the same thing. It's boring. The only thing educational were their exhibits. And recalling the Shamu Show, I even questioned the size of the tank: Those orca are big creatures.Food. Oh dear, where do I start? All restaurants have the same food, no matter where you go. The only exceptions are Mama Stella's and their deli place in the Annheuser-Busch building. And even if you got to their food, it's not appetizing, no matter how it looks. It's all boring. It's good, but not good enough.On a side note, I've seen reviews that were showing how they show animal cruelty by captivating these animals from their natural environment. Of course, it seems true. In fact, it's obviously true. Who in their right mind would spend so much time sacrificing both human lives and the sea animals' lives capturing these wonderful creatures, only to make them start performing these tricks like it's a circus? How is that anywhere near educational? And, again, the Shamu Show, especially ""Shamu Rocks!."" There's nothing great about ""Shamu Rocks!,"" nothing. It's all about loud music, a bunch of graphical simulations, jumping whales, and a guy in the background faking a random guitar solo. Totally educational, right? Nope, not even in the slightest. I'd rather go there for the arcade: It looks a lot fun, doesn't it? Well, I could find that anywhere like Nickel City, Boomers! (which, by the way, is just as boring as this establishment), and Boardwalk (same with Boomers!). Besides, how are they really saving the animals? You could save the animals by not making a stupid show about it. Rather, let them just freely roam around in a much bigger pool with actual seawater, and make it abundant of fish. Besides, feeding ""Shamu"" and his pals with just a fish or two handfuls honestly doesn't help much. If they eat about what... 500 lbs. of fish and/or food or something, then how do we know if they're fed that much? I digress.Back to the subject. Their rides. One could not simply explain the details that their ""Journey to Atlantis"" ride has. They have a Commerson's Dolphins exhibit, which the exhibit looks a bit small for them, really. The ride itself is a bit exciting, but really, I've been on better ones. It's also stupid that they would have this lady (mainly from the movie) say ""well done!"" like we achieved something important. The only thing we even achieved was getting soaked, at least that's what the people in the front seat would say.You know what's also funny about that ride? Notice how not many people go on there anymore? How the line is almost empty? I don't know about you, but when I was there, I would be on their ""car"" within 5 - 8 minutes. When it first opened, it had a line that poked out of the entrance by a few yards, maybe even more. It was THAT busy. But now, look at it. It's like not a lot of people really care about it, anymore. Same with the Arctic Thunder: I could get on there within less time. However, ""Believe"" (which is the Shamu Show, by the way) and Blue Horizon are literally PACKED. Why? Because they want to see a bunch of circus sea animals jump around for food.Overall, it's bland, nothing new. Best for kids, not for the environmentally-conscious (preferably because kids will like anything that they see, especially when it comes to amusement parks). The featured areas like the Sesame Street play area and the Journey to Atlantis ride provide unnecessary revenue and probably make the park's costs a lot higher. You might as well call this place a ""permanently established sea animal circus with the hybrid feature of an amusement park."" Also, it's overpriced, the admission tickets AND the food. Overpriced bullcrap, all of it. Don't bother going if you want something else better than this place."
1879,8/28/2013,3,"5 stars for Jamie at Mama Stella's Italian Restaurant1 star for the employees at the Journey to Atlantis gift shopI went to Sea World last Wednesday, August 21. Â I am gluten, dairy, and soy intolerant, and Jamie at Mama Stella's at Sea World was so so so so helpful in finding me food I could eat at the park. Â She had a special salad made just for me, called the corn cart to make sure they were still open and would save an ear of corn for me, and then helped me carry my tray to my seat (I was carrying a backpack, so I was having a hard time!). Â She let me look at the ingredient book for all of the food Sea world offers. Â I was just so impressed by her helpfulness.However, the teenage girls running the Journey to Atlantis gift shop that day were hostile and rude to me and other guests. Â I would not visit that gift shop again. Â They had terrible attitudes."
1880,4/28/2011,2,"You might wonder what the hell is that thing in the distance, why does it smell fishy here? What are those mooing sounds? Its the wonderful world of sea.Here you can unload your cash for a pocket full of boring sea animals performing demented skits to entertain their blubberous child-onlookers. Â Even if half the animals are too stupid to know whats going on, I still do. So I've got to be subjected to massive prices to come see a bunch of sea things frolic around in a big glass box of water? Oh and what about that Shamu show? Didn't Shamu kill the trainer? What does that tell you about this place.Now if the animal rebellion ever does start, trust that I'll be there to lead the revolution."
1881,3/14/2013,1,I wish I could say I loved it here. I was so excited to take my son for the first time. I remembered having so much fun there when I was young. Tanks were dirty. Food choices were poor and really expensive. There are so many fun and great things to do in San Diego. Do those things and stay far away from here.
1882,4/14/2016,1,"We spent about 30 percent of our time looking for directional signs, they are strategically placed not to see them, absolutely awful, we had no kids and we had a hard time finding our way......get new large signs, until then im probably not coming back!! They did this so you would come back another day to spend more money!! Get big signs and make them visible!!!"
1883,12/19/2012,2,years past i would give it 5 stars but all the shows have gone downhill. lucky for us we came on a cold/rainy day and people stayed away and it wasnt even close to being crowded. bring back the old shows !!
1884,8/31/2011,5,"Orcas, Dolphins and Belugas and tons of other animals there.Really nice shows and dedicated trainers. It was really interesting to see the training in Shamu's Stadium backpool."
1885,2/20/2011,4,"This was our 1st time at SeaworldMike, myself, Matthew, Disha and RuchiOur favesDolphin showAtlantis- the water coaster - husband LOVED ITPenguin exhibitWe will be back"
1886,6/9/2013,2,"I give Shamu and all the animals and fish 5 stars, but the park itself was a bit of a let down.Haven't been in years and it really was only so/so.They were filming the new Anchorman movie while we were there, so didn't get to see the dolphin stadium show - but we did see Shamu and the new baby Shamu and that was a real treat.The park has no rhyme or reason on how to get around. Â They give you a map, but you might as well just walk around and stumble into what you are looking for, which is what eventually will happen.Take one of those buckets to NOWHERE! Â just a ride to hawk a photo of you, nothing to see over there.A new Cirque style show was in dress rehearsal, but we got to see it, and that was a lot of fun...interesting that two decades later they still are doing that same old bit where someone in the audience is planted as part of the show...There is a ""Star Wars"" type simulator ride with all kinds of warnings, but we went on it anyway and not sure what the warnings were about - really lame special effects and goes to show you why Disney is so far ahead of most parks that really just don't make an effort to do a theme park right.All the animals were terrific to see above, below, in touch and feel pens - that's what you go to this park for...they can keep the roller coasters and other rides, that isn't what I want to see at Sea World, but Shamu - keep that show going - love watching other people get soaked!.Food - sad excuses for concession stands and many were closed. Â The one we went to had one girl who made each cheeseburger one at a time...and it took forever...you can pre-set a lot of what is on the burger so she can move faster...No need to go back for another couple decades."
1887,5/31/2011,5,"Its been years since I was at SeaWorld, so was unsure how excited a 2 yo would be for this. Â We bought a San Diego pass and planned on only spending one day here. Instead we cut short our trips to the beach (see my review of La Jolla Shores) and Legoland to return 2 more days! Â Of course the Sesame Street Bay of Play was a huge hit. Definitely took the edge off his long-lasting tantrum when he was too short for every ride at LegoLand. Â And the 3D movie will forever be his first time in a theater. The open aquariums he could touch fish, the shark tube, of course the killer whales were all fascinating to such a little one. He really enjoyed all of the shows, but surprising me was the fact his favorite was Cirque de Soleil. Â He was mesmorized, it was the longest I have ever seen him sit still and that includes sleeping. Â We really wanted to stay for a dinner picnic to watch fireworks but figured that was probably pushing it.Of course people will say its overpriced, etc. But its SeaWorld not Walmart. Â Of course you can always get discount tickets through AAA or Costco. Â I thought our admission was worth every penny and food was better than decent for an amusement park. Â The only negative in my eyes is it was early June during the week and many things were closed and shows were limited."
1888,11/13/2012,4,"Sea World was my favorite tourist attraction of them all this weekend. Only cuz my whole family loves sea animals far more than land. The kiddies got to do the dolphin interaction and boy did they enjoy it, so much that they wanted to go back the next day. There are 2 packages to interact with the dolphins. One where u get into Â a wetsuit and go into the water which was an hr long but its not worth it i don't believe. The cheaper one was staying out of the pool and it was 15 min but seeing both of the options, it was basically the same thing. THe show that they put on withthe dolphins in the Blue Horizon was better than I thought. It is a must see and dolphins are such smart animals.We didnt check out the Shamu show sice we dined with Shamu and we just werent impressed. Shamu is a big whale and the tank that Shamu is in seemed too small and i agree somwhat that Shamu wasn't a happy.My kids loved feeding the bat rays. $5(with memebership) or $6 without for 5 little fishes was steep but it was such a great experience. Even I loved it. I have not squeeled like that in a long time feeling them suck the fish out of my fingers.THe manta ride was fun for my 2 older kids and they couldn't get enough. The food, well...just bring your own. mY kids didn't even finish the pizza from Mama's pizza and that says it all. They do sell turkey drumsticks from the cart if you want some better protein choices. Parks should get better food. It would just be the smart thing to do. Oh and btw DO NOT LEAVE FOOD UNATTENDED. there are seagulls that are the look out for something yummy and we saw one grabbed a pizza off the plate. Kind of funny hehehe...ANd one also grabbed a fish out of my daughters hands while she was trying to feed the sea lions. ANd boy are they fiesty. It was cold that day we went and I'm sure it would have been much better if it was warmer. The Manta ride is for 42"" and taller and my 2 older kids kept going on it since the line was... well there was no line. Â We bought the 3 in 1 pass and its a good for 7 days unlimited entry."
1889,4/19/2011,4,"Now that we have Fun Pass valid for a year, Seaworld is my new, favorite SoCal theme park! :DVisited with the fam over the weekend and it was just FUN, FUN, FUN! Â Show and Ride Ratings:Pets Rule - 3 stars. Â While I may have issue with animals used in a show, I am happy to note that most of the animals used in THIS show are rescue animals. Â Huge round of applause for those wonderful creatures!Sesame Street Experience - 3 stars. Â This 4D show runs continously throughout the day for about 20 minutes. Â Feels a bit dated, although was a hit with the little ones. Â For you poncho lovers out there, make sure you bring it to this show! Â Dolphin Show - 5 stars! Â Theatrical, skillful, a feast of color and music for the eyes. Â The set itself is very elaborate, and the swimmers / dancers / acrobats plus costumes made sitting under the hot, hot sun worth it! Â Oh, and the dolphins were awesome too. :pShamu - 5 stars! Â Shamu is rightfully the star of Seaworld. Â Show was packed. Â Come early and secure at seat at the very last row of the Soak Zone. Â You will get splashed a bit, but just enough to be excited about it. Â Shipwreck Rapids - 5 stars! Â Fun ride for all ages (yes, my 67 year old Mom survived it and so should you!). Â Word of warning though: Â YOU WILL GET SOAKED TO THE BONE. Â Even if you hide under those ridiculous looking ponchos (you are in a theme park people! Â get with the program!). Â Your best bet is to bring an extra set of clothes. Â Ditch the idea of paying $5 for a 5 minute whole body dryer experience at the end of the ride. Â Total waste of money but a great photo op!Journey to Atlantis - hate heights, hate speed. Â This ride had both of them plus a huge helping of another ""soaked to the bone"" moment. Â Yes, I wimped out but my niece swears that it is not for the faint of heart. Â I heard her uninterrupted scream of terror as she came hurtling down the 3 story slide at the end of the ride. Â You have been warned.Not my only visit this year so stay tuned for the updates. Â Can't wait to try the teeny, tiny airplanes at Sesame Street Bay of Play! :p"
1890,7/10/2013,3,"Sea World has a few rides that are pretty good but depending upon when you go, like any amusement park, the wait can be long to actually ride them. Â The shows are always a big hit and this year the Pet Rules show added a kangaroo to the mix which was AWESOME!!!! Parking is 15.00 or 20.00 if you would like to park a bit closer, but I don't recommend it unless you have a health issue. There are many different types of shows, you need to arrive early to get good seating and I like that there are several options for food."
1891,11/29/2010,3,"Over 400 people have reviewed SeaWorld, so I really don't think anything more can be said about this aquatic amusement park, but I will share with you my experience and what worked and didn't work for me. And hopefully that will give you some insight on what to expect when (or if) you visit. First off, I hadn't been to SeaWorld in over ten years. I noticed a lot of changes -- although, it could just be my poor memory -- and improvements since my last visit. There were many more exhibits and rides than my last visit, but the tried and true shows were still there -- Shamu of course and that cute otter and seal show.Second point to make is that on this particular visit it was raining. Now, as I understand it, San Diego rarely gets rain, and when they do it is usually in the winter. However, the weather gods decided that on my mid-October vacation, San Diego would receive a very unusual weather change. It started out as a drizzle, which soon turned into a steady rain for the next two hours. Luckily we had umbrellas because quite honestly, I wasn't about to pay $9 for a cheesy plastic poncho that I would never wear again. SeaWorld is not too fun in the rain -- in fact, most amusement parks are really no fun in the rain. The only bonus was the lack of crowds. Nevertheless, I tired with all my might to enjoy myself. And, I did have a good time. Most of the exhibits were inside, so that allowed us to escape the rain for a bit and dry off. But if you wanted to enjoy a show, that was another story. I wasn't so smart in my unplanned rainy day attire. My pants were lightweight and if I ventured to sit down on the soaking wet aluminum bleachers, everyone would have gotten a nice transparent view of my underwear. So, standing up became my only option, which wasn't much fun and annoyed the people sitting behind me.The highlights for me were the penguin and polar bear exhibits, and the dolphin area, where I got to touch a dolphin. Being a former dolphin geek -- I collected all things dolphins back in the day -- I was absolutely enamored by those clever and beautiful creatures and was so happy I finally touched one! I also liked seeing all of the regal flamingos standing and walking about -- a great photo moment no doubt.The only really truly bad side of the whole experience, beside the uncomfortable weather conditions, was the food. Perhaps the other restaurants were better, but the one we chose, Shipwreck Reef Cafe, was a really ""wreck."" It was set up like a cafeteria with food options like hamburgers, beef sandwiches and ribs. I had the beef sandwich, and it was gross. Â Not really fully cooked, really fatty and cold. And the fries were no better. I know you shouldn't expect much from amusement park food, but for as much as you pay to get into the place, and the amount you pay for their food, I would expect better. Despite the less than appetizing food, the rain and the overly expensive ticket prices, SeaWorld is still a cool place to visit. Kids love it as do adults. There is plenty to do and see, the people that work there are very pleasant, and when the weather cooperates it is a lovely way to spend your day in San Diego. I'm sure I'll go back for another visit -- it may be another ten years -- and hopefully that time it won't be raining."
1892,12/29/2014,1,"Horrible experience while awaiting to get our tickets. We spent over 75 minutes just trying to get our tickets. No line management whatsoever, people cutting in line all over the place, blocking traffic trying to enter the park. Their e-commerce site did not work, telling us that we could 't use our credit card twice for the same transaction, even though we were trying to purchase for that one transaction. The management really needs to think through its operations"
1893,12/1/2014,1,"I actually like the place, but the one star is because they've started price gouging. Their black friday specials don't prominently mention a service fee that they tack onto the final cost (service fee? give me a break). And they've now dumped their preschool pass for 3-5 year olds. I get that the economy and recent animal protests are hurting Seaworld's bottom line, but they'll end up pushing away fans of the place."
1894,4/17/2013,4,"A great place to enjoy seeing Shamu but it can get really expensive when you take the whole family. Â They have the Killer Whale show, The Dolphin show, Sea Lions and i'm not too sure how many others they have added by now but it is still a great time to spend your day!"
1895,7/21/2012,1,"$73.00 to get in,fine. thumb print scan at entrance really slow. Map of park useless. Attractions you have to be there 45 mins. early to find a seat, because all the good seats are reserved for platinum or gold who-evers. Â same with the rides. you get a fast pass and come back to stand in line behind these special whatevers. Â Hot in the stadiums you will get wet or not get a seat. Food is the worst part of the park."
1896,5/17/2014,5,One of the best family trips ever! I took the whole family and we had the best time of our lives. Great shows. Good food and the park was not too crowded. My parents said it was better than Disneyland :)
1897,6/27/2010,1,"This place is garbage. Â First of all it needs to figure out whether it's an aquarium or an amusement park. Â It's trying to do both and is doing neither well. Â The aquarium at Scripps is better. Â And as far as amusement goes, I'd rather go to the video game arcade in Mission Valley. Â Best thing this place has going for it is the Budweiser center lets you try their beers free so you get a little buzz. Â Which isn't saying much since Bud really isn't that good anyway.Plus, the nightly fireworks display at 10pm wakes my daughter at least Â once a week. Â Aren't there noise pollution laws? No noise over a certain decibel level after a certain time period? Â How does Seaworld get away with it.Boycott this place for all that's holy!"
1898,4/10/2014,3,"Have taken the kids a couple times and they always have a great time. My bank account doesn't enjoy it as much. Food is very pricey. There are no picnic areas for you to pack a lunch so unless you want to sit in a hot asphalt parking lot you are gonna pay. Definitely recommend buying the dining pass. It's still not cheap, but definitely hurts the wallet a little less. Would give 5 stars if there were more affordable food options"
1899,10/21/2013,4,"This has always been one of my favorite amusement parks since I was a child. I got the chance to visit SeaWorld now as an adult and I was happy to discover that I still enjoy this place as much as I used to. Granted, there is a lot dedicated to park guests with kids but we still had a nice time enjoying all the shows and exhibits. I never tire of getting to touch and feed sea life - I could probably watch sea life animals all day long and never tire of it. We didn't ride any of the rides this time around but might give it a try if we get to come back sometime soon. Hopefully we can find a good deal on ticket prices so we can make that sooner rather than later."
1900,11/22/2012,4,"First time at Sea World for me ever, I know, such a shocker seeing as I love animals.Disclaimer: I only did a half-day trip so I skipped a few things I could see at Monterey Bay Aquarium and didn't make it to the rides. Pretty much just saw the animals. Also, the food looked okay but we didn't really eat any because we just snacked and didn't really have time to sit down and eat. We had funnel fries and cotton candy though. And they do brew Starbucks coffee which was good, got me my usual, a venti White Chocolate Mocha. Reasons ya gotta make a trip now:1. Sea/see animals galore. Pun intended!2. You get to pet and feed dolphins. They're so freaking cute and it's so fun. First time ever touching a dolphin! There were extra dolphin interaction things where you pay more to swim with them and stuff but I didn't do those. They have a free little interaction show thing with the trainers and you can feed them then, if you happen to be near a trainer, they'll give you fishes to feed them. The trainers will tell the dolphins to come over and you can pet them, too. 3. See the baby dolphin with it's momma. Super cute!4. Pet bat rays. They look so weird and definitely don't feel the same as dolphins, it's quite interesting. There is an option to buy food to feed them. 5. See beluga whales. Enough said.6. Watch the show with the pilot whale, the only show with a pilot whale!7. SHAMU! They have quite a few at the show. 8. They have a huge walrus that's fat and pink, kind of looks like a huge naked mole rat. 9. Pets Rule show was pretty cute, they had dogs, cats, and a pig do tricks. Reasons for -1 star: 1. Tickets are pretty pricey, I get it, these animals are huge and expensive, but this place is for-profit and it's obvious, especially when you compare it to the SD zoo.2. The One Ocean show was cool because you get to see the killer whales but it was a bit annoying because I felt like they were trying to shove the ""Save the Oceans"" bit at me. 3. Blue Horizons show was weird. A mix of Cirque du Soleil with dolphins. Super weird. It also had a super weird storyline. Not a fan, thought it was the only show where you could see dolphins and the pilot whale."
1901,2/24/2016,5,"You can't come to San Diego and not stop by and say hello to Shamu!!!! I take my family once or twice a year to say hi. This a full day of activities and fun. You might get wet and you will walk a lot. So come comfy or bring an extra set of walking shoes, sandals or clothes. Prices are fair, the food is good and pricing is fair. If you arrive early you'll have enough time to do everything. Rides, shows, museums interact with animals this place is always fun. For adults, if you want a beer guess what? They have beer stands so you don't suffer under our warm SD sun. Fun for all ages. Wheelchair friendly. Parking is good."
1902,6/28/2011,5,Me and my kids can not seem to get enough of Sea World! They just love it! The deal they have pay for one day get the rest of the year free is perfect!! With 2 toddlers we cant stay all day but we can always come back!! We loved the new Shamu show!
1903,10/1/2013,3,"My husband took me to Sea World for a few days for my birthday on 09/23 as I had never been there and he had not been there since he was a boy back in the late 1950s. Â First of all it costs $15 a day for parking, $20 if you wish to get close to the entrance. Â Don't forget where you parked as it is a very large parking lot. Â It was also very crowded despite the fact that we went on a Tuesday and Wednesday. Â There were lots of foreign tourists and children were everywhere. Â There were stroller parking areas everywhere as well. A one day adult ticket was $64 so we bought the more expensive week long access as it was cheaper than two one day tickets. Â Be prepared for them to fingerprint you so you can't give your ticket to someone else. Â Also be prepared to walk a lot as nothing is as direct as I would have thought it would have been. Â Your entry ticket is good for everything except a few costly extras such as donning wetsuits to pet the dolphins or have your picture taken with Shamu. Â The downside is that there are very few big shows and be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes in a long line. Â We skipped these and made do with the many exhibits and rides. Â Unfortunately some of them were closed when we were there. Â Also everything seems to start or end at a souvenir shop or food shop so be prepared to spend money if you have children with you. Â I would say that Sea World is now a theme park. Â Still I have to admit that I enjoyed the experience although next time I want to see sea creatures I will go to The Monterey Bay Aquarium."
1904,9/8/2014,1,Seaworld recently changed the policy to NOT ALLOW people to bring their own food into the park. Very unfriendly policy to families. Hoping to increase profit margins because families are forced to purchase expensive in-park food. Or you can leave the park (with kids in tow) and go to your car where you can have a lovely parking lot lunch.
1905,10/5/2014,5,"It's always a good time with the whole family here at Sea World. I love the shows and seeing how much affection the trainers have towards the animals. Sea World is an amazing place and the Fun Card is totally worth it!!! Highly recommend that you bring your family so your little ones can meet a lot of animals that otherwise they would never have a chance to see in their lives. Thank you, Sea World, for all you do for conservation and these beautiful animals!!!"
1906,7/22/2010,5,"This is the place to go in San Diego if you want to see ultra porn whale sex action! I'm not kidding. Full on penetration, I'm sure the guys from whale wars would love this place.You might think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Anyways!You can Â usually get good deals on the tickets here if you shop around, and if you really want to you can see the entire park in a day if you wanted, but I'd suggest taking it nice and easy (not like those whales did). I haven't been here since they added the new show, but the shows I did see were pretty nice, the shamu one was a little cheesy, but the sea lions tonight was pretty funny. It's pretty fun to see all of the animals here, and there is always someone around to answer questions about a particular animal or two.If there is one thing you HAVE to do is the sky bridge thingy around sunset, it goes over the bay and is absolutely amazing.Overall I have an amazing time every time I come here, even when I am scarred for life by the sight of whale sex."
1907,1/4/2011,5,"The place to visit when you are in socal! They got the show! Shamu and dolphins?! Unbelievable!!The day I went, it was raining but the rain didn't do much since it is already wet there.The Polar Express 4D was a great animation! (only during Christmas season I think).The rides are pretty good as well."
1908,6/6/2011,4,"It's been nearly a decade since I had taken my family to Seaworld and must say we had a terrific time. Â I really felt we got our moneys worth on our day at Seaworld. Â We arrived in the morning and before we knew it the sun was setting on a fantastic family day. Â Some people complain they don't have enough ""rides"" Â you want rides, go to Disneyland, if you want a unique zoological experience go to Seaworld."
1909,7/22/2013,4,"Went there today for my first time in decades. First the good. Shows are ok, have to remember OSHA is blocking trainers being in the water with Killer Whales. Loved the Biff skit at the Sea Lion show prior to it starting. Very funny. Park was clean and easy to find the show locations. Now the bad. Started as you enter the park. Their scanners must be original bar code models, way too slow to scan, frequently takes multiple attempts to work. Unacceptable. Sea World worker apologized for the shoddy processing, said it is like this every day. Really? What gets me is the non ergonomic setup. They ask to scan your right index finger so what side of the bar code reader is the finger scanner? The left/wrong side. Takes to long for each person to move to this area. Hey SeaWorld, either move the finger scanner to the R/H side or scan the left index finger. What is the difference? The change and adding world class bar code readers would reduce line waiting time and frustrations by everyone. Next is the lack of water faucets designed to quickly refill water bottles you bought or brought with you. I think SeaWorld would rather charge $3 per bottle then make it easy to refill. This goes against their ""Green Policy"" as refilling would mean fewer plastic bottles used. Now you wait in line for a drink at water fountains with low pressure while people ahead of you try to refill them. Hmmm, wonder why the water pressure is so low? Hey SeaWorld, you make enough off of $15 parking and other sales. Fix the water problem and reap the rewards of taking care of your customers. Yes, I still love going to SeaWorld and will return, a real class act park since I first went there back in the 60s. Great place to spend the day, take your visiting friends and relatives. Best tourist place in San Diego!"
1910,10/4/2011,5,"Haven't been here since I was probably 7. It's just as fun as it was before! If you time everything right, you can jump from one show to the next, with rides & activities in between. The Atlantis ride was unique & definitely one of my favorites. It was a water ride & a rollercoaster all in one. If you sit in the front rows for Shamu, guarantee drenched by the show is done. The pet show was super cute too - I can't believe those animals are all rescues & are super well-trained to do lots of tricks...even the cats & pig!Stayed from noon-5pm and definitely got my monies worth!"
1911,10/5/2010,2,"PROS: The exhibits and the shows. CONS: People walking around SMOKING and DRINKING. I understand if this was an adult theme park, but when it's summertime and the park is crowded, can we PLEASE have some sort of regulation to what we expose our kids to? I don't appreciate walking around with my daughter and having to cover her nose because some idiot wants to smoke around HIS kid. I gave two stars just because my daughter ended up on the Jumbotron during the Shamu show."
1912,11/10/2013,5,Had a great time at sea world! The offer free admission for military plus 3 dependant tickets. That's a lot of saving considering a daily ticket cost $71.00. They changed the shows around a little. The trainers no longer swim with shamu. Which was ok.. Still a great show. Wonderful time and the weather was great.
1913,8/10/2011,5,"Seriously, so amazing. This is really a must for any family. All the animals are so exciting to see!Favorite? EVERYTHING!"
1914,10/20/2011,5,"They have Shamu,beer & dippin dots.PlusIt's in sunny San Diego equalsAMAZING place the end"
1915,10/15/2013,4,"People complain food and tickets are expensive here. Go check out legoland. More outrageous there.Shows and rides are all very scripted, but that's the natural of it."
1916,1/1/2015,3,"before i came here i watched black fish which i recommended everyone to watch it Â but anyways i came here because my cousin wanted to come here and i got to say a lot has changed since i came here. First there were a lot of animals gone such as frogs, penguins, octopus, and etc . Second there was a lot of animals not treated right such as penguins being to fat , an eel that didn't want to be in a small water place, an bear that putted his head down because he didn't want Â to be inside the exhibit because he wasn't given proper care. Finally there were some closed shows but the rest of my cousin day was fabulous she enjoyed all the rides there and the shows there too."
1917,5/10/2013,3,"They get 3 stars for two reasons! First off... they took away my favorite childhood activity to do at SeaWorld! you cant feed the dolphins anymore what the heck! you have to pay a boat load of money to meet the dolphins or swim with them, not everyone has an extra $50-$100! So that takes off one starSecondly, I think they need to lower the price to park! That's the only thing that stops me from coming here more often. I have the season pass but I don't use it wet often because who wants to pay $15 to park for an hour or 2?? Sometimes I wanna stop by and watch a show or just go feed the batrays but that means I have to spend $15 just to park there so that makes me feel like I have to stay there longer so I end up not going, and that takes off another star.Some things I like about this place is feeding the batrays. You can pet them and feed them, I also love the new manta ride super fun! They have this deal where if you buy a beer cup you can get a discount on beer when you use that cup and you can bring it back each time to visit SeaWorld. The best show is the Shamu show for sure!Definitely a good place to bring people that are visiting San Diego :)"
1918,10/9/2011,5,"My husband and I visited SeaWorld on our honeymoon while we were in San Diego. We were fortunate enough to be staying with family that lived 2 miles away and road beach cruisers there, and had awesome parking right at the gate to get in. Also what is convenient is that there is a variety of food vendors in the park to accomodate many - there's even a Starbucks cart.We got to see the Sea Lion show which was very funny and just amazing, and the whale and dolphin (PHENOMENAL) shows. The best part of it all was just seeing how passionate the staff at SeaWorld are about these animals that that work and train with. I truly felt that I could sense that with these people there. I really felt like I got a new appreciation for nature again and reinforce my reasoning for being green. When we have kids, I definitely want to take them there since I never got to enjoy this as a child, I want them to have that opportunity to appreciate it earlier in life."
1919,4/30/2011,4,"It's one of those places where if you come to San Diego, you have you come at least once, but never really have to come back.Pretty much caught all the shows. Animals and sea life are pretty impressive.Seating fills up really quick. If you don't mind waiting, get there about half an hour before the show starts to get a good seat.First we saw the sea lion show. Entertaining and very cute. Especially the little otter who randomly just makes an appearance throughout the show. And who knew that a seal can do a flip?!The Blue horizons show - we kinda had a bad seat, but incredible divers, cool dolphins and pretty birds.The pets rule. So cute! Makes you want to get a pet and then train it to do stuff. I thought this would be a lame show but it was actually really entertaining and cute.And Shamu! Honestly, I can never figure out which one he is,but they all put on a good show. I love it when they splash the kids and they scream really loudly. Other than the shows, just some animal exhibits you can walk around and enjoy like the penguins and polar bears.You probably don't even really need a WHOLE day to go to sea world. The park is actually pretty small. I can walk from the entrance to the near back in less than 10 minutes. But then again, I walk pretty fast haha"
1920,12/23/2009,3,"Our brave hero got splashed by Shamu from sitting in the first 10 rows, and now he might have whale herpes. Â How often do they change the water in Shamu's 7 million gallon tank? Â Ever? Â Ick. Â Lick your lips after you're splashed and you might taste some whale urine.Our foolhardy hero rode the Shipwreck Rapids ride during a cold night. Â Big mistake: there's no avoiding getting soaked on this ride. Â There is a reason why they can sell $20 towels here at Seaworld.Oh, you can buy beer here? Â Suddenly, the sea lions comedy show at night just got a whole lot more entertaining.PROS:- Free fireworks at night during the summer.- Well organized shows with a lot of variety to choose from: Shamu, dolphins, pets, comedy, 4-D movies, and more!- The Journey to Atlantis ride is pretty exciting and worth riding over and over a few times if the line is very short (usually around closing time after dark).CONS:- Ridiculously overpriced food and drinks.- It's hard not to step on any children when navigating this giant daycare center.- They close the doors to shows when they start, so there's no catching a show midway through. Â You better show up on time and read the show guide!"
1921,5/1/2010,1,"This is one of those experience where I go, ""I've been. Mm...yeah.""Not worth the money. Paid almost $70 for one-day admission. Saw some flamingos, big sea turtles, sea lions, Sesame Street 4D show, and Shamu. Rode in the Journey To Atlantis ride -- short and fun. Got splashed a little. The Shamu show was cute but way too short. As for the few other animals, you're better off going to a zoo.The Sesame Street 4D show was mostly water sprinkling, a brief moment of fan blowing, and an even briefer moment of cookie smelling and sock smelling. Not all that amazing."
1922,5/15/2013,4,"I got the year long pass and how can anyone complain about that! Â It gives me a full year of free entrance into Sea World, I still have to pay $15 for parking, but I get a full year of roller coasters, petting manta rays and getting splashed by Shamu! Â I feel like a kid again!"
1923,12/2/2006,1,"*Note - I went a year ago...but the painful memory still lingers.Sure, they call it an amusement park - but I was not amused.On the day we went, of the two measly rides they have, one of them, the Atlantis coaster, was out of commission all morning. Â So in only two hours, we'd seen and done everything. After paying $150.00 for three people, I was not too pleased. Â And then they wanted more of my money. Â I had to pay $3.00 more for a straw to drink my soda. Â I'm not kidding! To pet the dolphins, we needed to cough up another $4.00 for some fish. And if we wanted a view of the park on the sky tower, that would've cost us another $3.00 per person. Â Twelve dollars for a view?!!!To top it off, literally, a seagull crapped on my head. Â And then the Sea World cartoon ""artist"" mocked my daughter in a Valley girl voice. Â When she asked where the dolphins were, he said, ""They're, like, totally over there!"" Â So we're, like, totally, never returning to Sea World - even if the bat rays are the coolest. Â Have you ever pet a bat ray? Â Just like slippery little puppy dogs.I might've given this place another 1/2 star if my daughter were younger. Â Then she could have at least enjoyed the water park, where kids can get wet and run around. Â But since my daughter's a teenager, there really wasn't much to do. Â Yep, the marine life is amazing to watch...but come on!!! Â $150.00!!!? We could have spent the entire day at Disneyland or gone surfing in the ocean where, on occasion, we've shared the waves with a few seals and dolphins."
1924,1/18/2016,5,"Awesome fun and relaxation for my family. We live about 20 miles away from the park and we go all the time. We have the annual passes and we just keep renewing because we still enjoy ourselves every time. Any negative experience has always been because of a rude or clueless guest and the park staff manage to keep that to a minimum. The shows are interesting and funny. The animals are fascinating. I'm so grateful we have an opportunity to get close to them. The staff really likes to teach and have a great deal of information. Example-My daughters have an almost unhealthy fascination with Porcupines. Yeah, I don't get it either. But, they asked some questions and got so much interaction with the trainers and animals that it was mind blowing for them. Now, all I hear is ""Taro and Kantoro"" this or that. I'm sure I spelled their names incorrectly but the impact of that time with the handlers and the animals was awesome. Neither of the people involved HAD to take the time or make the effort. That's the point. They WANTED TO. They understand that proximity to and knowledge about, these animals is the very best way to protect and provide for them. This is the type of experience we have over and over here. After many years observing the animals and trainers I can tell you, FOR SURE, that they really care about and love these critters. I hope they can continue doing what they do for my grandkids like they have for me and my kids. That's why this family really loves these animals. Please keep up the good work guys."
1925,6/27/2010,5,"MY FAVORITE PLACE IN SAN DIEGO!!!!!You can touch & feed sea animals, watch shows, ride rides...We arrived about an hour after the park opened, so many rides were not open during that time. Rides opened at 12, so we looked at other stuff & went on the rides last. Bring extra clothes, you will get wet. We went on 3 rides, 2 of them were soaking wet rides. They were Shipwreck Rapids yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦ & Atlantis yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦. Lots & lots of sea creatures to see...belugas yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, penguins yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, polar bears yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, sting rays, dolphins, orcas yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, sea lions yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, walrus yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦ & lots lots more.We were a couple days too early for the Blue Horizons show, next time I'll be here for that. We saw the Shamu Believe show yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, sea otter & sea lion live show yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, & Pets Rule show yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦. All of the shows were really entertaining, we arrived early for good seats (soak section seats, because it was so hot). The Shamu Believe show was probably the best, lots of killer whales doing tricks. Sea Lion Live is similar to SNL, the show is very entertaining for the entire family. The shows were SO COOL, the animals are really well trained. All of the animals in the Pets Rule show were rescue animals, either their owners didn't want them or they were found. I love how Sea World takes them in. We skipped the Sesame Street show, but I'm sure that show is great for youngsters. Â You can feed sting rays yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦, sea lions...touch sting rays, dolphins...dolphins didn't come close enough for me to touch them =[ yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦There are also other additional excursions such as swimming with the animals & petting them...I wanted to do this, but it is $$$. Maybe I'll have the chance next time, FYI you need reservations for that. We went on 3 rides: Journey to Atlantis, Shipwreck Rapids, and Wild Arctic Ride. Journey to Atlantis & Shipwreck Rapids, you will get soaked so bring extra clothes & a towel. Wild Arctic Ride is a simulator ride, so you may get motion sickness but I believe there is an area where you don't have to ride the simulator & still get the experience of the journey they take.We bought so many stuffed animals, I wish I bought more. The plastic bag they provide aren't very strong, my new friends wanted to escape. Good thing these new friends were sort of malleable and were able to fit in my backpack.I will definitely be back in the future.My favorite quote I saw on a wall at Sea World. ""Extinction is forever. Endangered means we still have time..."" yelp.com/biz_photos/2j9tâ€¦ wise words.5 stars, I've become an aspiring animal trainer."
1926,6/3/2011,5,Pretty good ride especially on a hot summer day! Â You will get wet or soaked so bring a ziplock bag for your cell phone and wallet. Â Fun Times!!
1927,2/25/2010,1,"We visited on Thursday Feb 25, 2010. This was our third or fourth time back, but the first in almost 10 years. Things have changed, and not for the better. This used to be one of our favorite attractions in San Diego. But, the Blackstone Group bought Seaworld from Anheuser-Busch in 2009, and there's a lot more missing these days than the Clydesdales and free beer:This is not at all a hospitable place. Everything about the park is infused with the stench of corporate greed and hostility to the guest.It starts with parking. $14 to park. Like there's another option. Just build it into the admission price you jerks! It sets the tone wrong. Don't you know that? EVERYONE resents the parking fee. (Yeah, I know. Disney charges too. But, you know what? That's where the whole comparison ends.)The admission booth: Lines are needlessly long because they offer about a dozen different ticket packages at every window. The 2 pack, 3 pack, SoCal this and Park Hopper that. Zoo? Animal Park? Give me a freakin' break! How about an express line for a ticket to the freakin' park, so that everyone doesn't have to wait in line while Gert and Sven from Minnesota, and Joe Bob and Betty from Dallas, and Mildred and Bert from Moline all try to figger out th' deal?OK, so we got the ticket. Now we need to get in. Just short of a strip search and anal probe, which I think they're introducing in May. God forbid you smuggle in a bottle of water or some cheese crackers. (Good luck finding a drinking water fountain anywhere in the park!)Then, they fingerprint you. I swear to God, they actually fingerprint you to match you to your ticket. This is obnoxious, invasive, unnecessary, and slows down the admission process yet again since the machine doesn't work very well, and the little Brown Shirts at the door allow none to pass regardless of how long it takes to make their infernal machine work. If the rest of the free world can live with a hand stamp... what gives these bastards the right?No dolphin show. Not until some time in May, while they rebuild the auditorium. Ticket price reduction due to the major attraction being long term unavailable? Nope.Wild Arctic motion ride? Not a hint of upgrade or improvement or even maintenance since our last visit in 2000. Very dated and unimpressive.Penguin exhibit? It felt sad and smelled bad.The Shark exhibit? Again, nothing new, nothing spruced up. Stale.The Seal, Sea Lion, Walrus and Sea Otter show was cute, but much shorter than any of us remembered. Also, extremely crowded, because like all the other shows, they were only being run once or twice during the day. This was a huge cutback.The splash roller coaster is a nice fun ride. When you go down the big flume, they take a picture of you, just like at all the other theme parks. When you get off the ride, they display the photo on a monitor, just like at all the other theme parks. Some people snap a photo of the photo on the wall, which I had never heard of but all the other patrons told me is, these days, just like at all the other theme parks, where they don't care if you do that. BUT NO! Not here at SeaWorld. Here, if one of the Brown Shirts sees a camera, they block the photos from being displayed. Apparently someone - NOT me - tried to take a photo. As a result, neither of my nieces nor I were allowed to see our picture. WEREN'T ALLOWED!!! The Brown Shirt said ""Someone attempted personal photography. No personal photography is allowed."" I had no idea what was going on. It all had to be explained to me later.The Shamu show? Kind of short. Much more sappy than it used to be. All this malarkey about preserving nature, while they're keeping giant mammals in captivity and making them do stunts for treats. Hey, I know. I paid and I watched. What I'm saying is, ""Quit the ecology crap. It's obviously all about the Benjamins.""Finally, off to see the only dolphins we can see today. Except we can't. Even though the list of ""Today's Activities"" says that the dolphin pool is open until 5:00 PM, it's roped off at 4:40 when we arrive. The Brown Shirt at the gate says, ""It's closed. It closes at sunset."" ""Right. OK, the sun is high in the sky. Sunset is at 5:38 today. The guide says it's open until 5."" Nein! Verbotten!This place almost got two stars instead of one star from me just because I really love Marine Parks. Despite the horrible atmosphere created by, and attitude of, the corporate operator, our group of 6 did have a fun day. Not nearly as much fun as it would have been easy for Blackstone to deliver (and Busch used to) but more fun than my review makes it sound like. I doubt I'll be back, but my daughter could talk me into it. All the kids did really have fun.Anyone who is thinking of patronizing this rotten-to-the-core business masquerading as conservation organization should think twice, be prepared for a fleecing, and then have a good time. And please decide which ticket you're going to buy while you're still in the RV."
1928,11/24/2007,1,"I'm confused. Â I have money, and don't usually fret about spending it, but I expect something for it. Â A family of four, two of them under five, and I spent $300 in four hours to see a couple of cage wilted whales do a backflip, shelter dogs and cats run around in circles, and dolphins jump. Â I also got a tasteless sausage sandwich and a couple of tee shirts...All pathetically veiled in the guise of being Â a park to help ""the animals""...all to make Budweiser richer. Â Yep, its a money making park by our friends at Anheiser Bush. Â Screw 'em.If you really want to see animals in action, in an environment that actually does try to help animals, check out the San Diego Zoo. They really do try to rehabilitate, and really do care. Â Hats off to them. Â However, this Sea World thing is a crock. Â For half this extortionist rate, I took the family on a boat off Big Sur and we sailed next to whales that were..get this...wild and happy! Â This place is depressing, but its success I guess is just another example of our Denny eating, reality show watching, useless populace. Â By the way, average weight of those in the park, 270 pounds..women included. Â Enjoy, and swig a sixer of Bud on your way home. Â August Bush thanks you."
1929,8/24/2008,4,"We used this kennel for my parents dog who came from out of town. I am always freaked out about leaving fur babies in kennels, but she did fine. They kennels are about 5x4 feet on a slant in case they go potty. You have to provide your own food and water and are welcome to come visit and walk them throughout your visit. The staff is friendly and alert. It's located near the front on the left when you enter the parking area."
1930,9/3/2011,3,"OK, so the last time I was here, I was 4 years old. Â It will probably be another 30 years until I come back.I was really underwhelmed with the whole experience. Â They had some good exhibits, such as the Artic and the Penguins. Â But honestly, you can see a lot of this stuff at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach for half the price. Â Which leads me to the admission prices of $69 which is borderline ridiculous. Â We only paid $49 because we used a McDonald's coupon, but even at that amount it seems overpriced. Â They have different pricing options which some people found really confusing. Â So confusing, that the people selling the tickets would have to explain them to every person. Â This caused us to wait 20 minutes for tickets when there was only about 5 people in front of us in line.It can get crowded as well. Â Plan on getting to the shows at least 30 minutes before they start to get a good seat. Â We thought it would be fun to ride the Sky Way only to wait almost an hour for a 6 minute ride. Â Really not worth it.And don't waste your time downloading the SeaWorld app, it's worthless. Â It was slow and hard to see in the sunlight. Â They gave estimated wait times for the rides and attractions, but they were unreliable. Â For example, it quoted no wait for the Sky Way when we waited an hour.The star attraction is One Ocean which is the Shamu show. Â I was very impressed on what these whales can do. Â This show almost made it all worth it and is a must do.."
1931,4/24/2015,5,"My family loves to go, the animals are great and well taken care of."
1932,4/1/2015,5,"I took my daughters to Sea World around February 2015. Â The park is very clean and well-kept up. Â Sea World does so much to promote preservation, education, and enjoyment of sea life. Â The animals appeared very well-cared for. Â To me the workers seemed to really care on a personal level, for the sea life, including dolphins, whales, etc.Sea World also employs so many young people and minorities. Â I also saw senior citizens working for the park. I really appreciate how it appears to me that Sea World tries to provide jobs for different, sometimes overlooked groups in society. Â The Manta roller coaster is fantastic and we loved it, and went on it three times. Â The workers went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.I enjoyed the trip so much that we are thinking of returning in around maybe one month.I liked how we parked, and the walk to the main gate was close, and easily accessible.Sea World has many restaurants for different budgets, from fast-food to more comfortable sit-down restaurants.The only thing I would have liked to see was that big roller coaster-like ride in the front of the park, to be open and operating, but I don't know its name. Â I also suggest that Sea World open at least one more roller coaster or thrill type ride.Overall, the park receives a 5 from me for cleanliness, fun, shows and attractions, good attitudes of employees, as well as rescuing and promoting sea-life."
1933,5/13/2014,2,"Disneyland Ticket $92 (Pricey, but what a showplace!)Sea World Ticket $84 (And barely worth half that!)I just spent the day at Sea World with friends for the first time in many years. Sea World is celebrating their 50th anniversary, but unfortunately much of the park still looks like it's celebrating their 25th anniversary. When you are charging just a few bucks less than Disneyland, you have big shoes to fill, and Sea World isn't filling them. Or even trying. The Good:The dolphin show was great! A little artsy-fartsy, but lots of great performers and wonderful animal acts. The Clyde & Seamore show was just silly fun. The Manta roller coaster was a surprising thrill, and landscaped nicely. And feeding the sea lions and touching a dolphin's nose was a genuine thrill. The new entrance area looks fresh and unique, with neat tide pools to play in. The animal trainers/hosts in the water at the big exhibits were knowledgeable and friendly, always ready to answer questions and looked happy to be there. The Bad:The food service was slow and expensive like you'd expect in a theme park, but it was also gross. There are tons of gift shops all over all selling the same tacky t-shirts and shot glasses. Many of the mid-sized or smaller exhibits looked painfully stuck in the 1980's, with old signage and technology in dated facilities; completely ignoring the advances in communication and display tech of the last 15 years. The Shamu show was impressive because of the gorgeous whales, but also pointless because of the weird theme and vague plotline that just seemed to be bland corporate slogans repeated over and over to no real effect. The Ugly:The operations employees are just bad. The ride operators were covered in tattoos and did a fabulous job of ignoring passengers as they joked with each other and slowly dispatched rides. The food service folks were disinterested at best. None of the operations employees looked professional or had any sense of polish or showmanship, unlike Disneyland employees. Spending six hours there we were ignored by the mostly blank-faced employees unless we sought out their attention. The Atlantis water ride is perhaps the stupidest ride ever built; the effects don't work, there's no real point other than splashing, and you just feel embarrassed that they applied a bizarre Atlantis aesthetic to any of it. The Artic simulator ride is like a very cheap version of Star Tours circa 1990, but forget about that HD 3-D update that Disneyland made to Star Tours; Sea World still thinks it's 1990 and the budget got cut again. More Ugly:The facilities (beyond the new entry) range from reasonably well maintained to faded and tired, and the landscaping was nice yet uninspired; but the whole park is just a mish-mash of themes and architecture and aesthetics from many decades. It's kind of sad to walk through and notice how it fits together. There's no unifying look to anything, and a surprising lack of shade in many areas of the park that has had 50 years to mature a tree canopy. What few theme areas they attempt, like ""Caribbean"" or ""Japanese"" or ""California Mission"" are all done rather cheaply and without any thought to details or storytelling. The park comes off as a random collection of themed shopping center architecture of the late 20th century, and it doesn't work. No one is tending to the details of why the park is there and what it's trying to tell people. And it's almost as expensive as a day at Disneyland or California Adventure?!? That's the real crime!"
1934,6/28/2009,3,"I am easily amused when it comes to amusement parks, since I always went to the lower priced ones as a kid. A park as Sea World is 65 bucks a person + x 6 for me and my brothers and sisters= not gonna happen. I developed from that that I am not the biggest fan of big parks, so I didn't really had the urge to go to Sea World earlier. One of the visitors that I had over loves parks though, so off we went. I think there were seriously about twenty employees waiving us where we had to park. If the huge signs and thick white marked lines aren't clear enough. I realize the task might be more difficult with young Skittle- stoned children in your back seats, but I felt slightly retarded. I know I'm a women and blond so that does not work in my favor with judging my parking skills, but Â nineteen people would have been enough.Anyway, once we got safely through the security check (always exciting) we started with a visit to the Shamu show. These animals are impressive even if they don't move. They are so big and move so graceful. The huge LCD screens definitely help to make the experience more overwhelming. Â I also liked the fact that it seemed like the animals had some kind of freedom in what kind of tricks they wanted to do. This was the highlight of the day for me though. The sea lion show was a little bit too cheesy for me. I loved the small cute little otter there, but I was over all more amused and distracted by the obese people in the public feeding their already fat children mega sugar pretzels with layers of chocolate, sugar and whatever what was on it. I can understand you want to give your kids a bite during such a day trip, but these things could satisfy at least three sea lions. Insanely huge. All the food at Sea World is a rip off like in any other amusement park, so it couldn't be because of the bargain.I liked the polar beer section and since I've been lucky enough to see these animals from close by in the wild I was not so excited about the penguins and dolphins. I can't help it that Sea World gives me mixed feelings. I do believe they treat the animals nicely but at the same time it makes me sad by the lack of space they have.The open sections with animals were set up nicely, I really liked the aquariums and the turtle. I was lucky not to go on a super busy day, so there were basically no lines anywhere and the park is not that big so we saw everything (except the the pet section, we were in a sea life park after all). The splash/roller coaster or whatever the name of the thing is, is cool. For me, might be lame for any other adult. I am not the biggest thrill seeker when it comes to heights, so I always look like I'm taking a bite of a lemon on the picture after wards. Not gonna buy that one for fifteen bucks. The other thing we did besides seeing animals were the cable cars. Pick the tower if you choose between the two, the cable cars are lame as hell for anyone under eight, you're just Â going back and forth over the water. It's not worth the extra bucks they charge you for it.I think Sea World is a good family park that is great for kids. My friends loved it and are the same age as me, so perhaps it is just me that was not too impressed given the money that it costs. I did have a good time but the shamu show was the only thing I would come back for. Owh, and my youth love Elmo. I don't think I will use my pass again this year, even though it's free entrance until the end of this year."
1935,1/5/2012,5,"LOVE IT, I went down to San Diego with our RV for three days trip.On Sunday we purchase tickets for sea world (on BZ days buy the VIP once, it's well worth it).Its different world,my kids was all over the place, great show, cold beer, what else can you ask.I will definitely go there again."
1936,8/25/2011,4,"I had fun memories as a kid when I went to SeaWorld for the first time. We took my 22 month old son here during out LA family vacation this past week. This was also my husband's first time. We watched most of the shows - The Shamu Show - One Ocean, Blue Horizons at Dolphin stadium and Sea Lions LIVE. There was also a Sesame Street show and Pet's Rule but we didn't take him there. My son was more interested in the animals.In between shows, we went to see the new Turtle Reef, which my son seemed to enjoy. Also, we went to the Penguin Encounter and Wild Arctic. At the Wild Arctic, there is ride but you can decide to just do the walk tour. There were other animal attractions but we couldn't see them all. At the Shamu stadium, you can dine with Shamu, which wasn't there when I went to SeaWorld. It's actually a neat idea though I'm not sure how much that would be. At the Sesame Street Bay of Play, the kids can get a little wet. If you have a stroller, there are stroller parking near the shows.There's also a water ride called the Journey to Atlantis, which would have been so nice to ride because it was so hot. There is so much to do at SeaWorld that you can spend the entire day there. It's still as much fun as I remembered and I look forward to taking my son here again when he's older."
1937,9/27/2014,1,"What a disappointment...They should never advertise about the free entrance for health care workers and then retract it with no announcement. Me and my wife and two kidswent there today only to find out they don't allow nurse for the free entance. They allowed us to print a confirmation ticket only to be driven away my a rude supervisor named Vincit. She said she already drove away ""thousands"" of nurses or something on the same field and she seems proud of it. Why not a simple advertisement on the web site about this miscommunication? an apology? but no she insist that wasn't their Â mistake. So she's insinuating all those thousands that came only to be driven away are all morons for not calling them for the retraction. A billion dollar company can't even put an ad on the newspaper about the mistake nor just for a little courtesy put it on their web site. Then she offers a 50% discount for everybody? What an insult. It was already 2pm when the supervisor,Vincit, shows up to offer the 50% discount and the park closes at 5PM. She should do the math sometimes and see that the ammount of food purchase on that single trip[ will already compensate whatever entrance fee. We all are familiar of the staggering cost of food inside the park. Because of this lack of courtesy, me and my wife loss a whole day pay. Thanks a lot SEAWORLD. I hope you guys can sleep at night for the thousand of guest you irritated."
1938,4/21/2008,1,"I hated seaworld. I am sure my nasty hangover didn't help the experience, or the sort of chilly weather. But $59 bucks? Really?! Standing in line for 40 minutes for lunch. Yuck! Just two real rides there? The sky lift thing was closed, so was the manitee area and the tower thingy. Screaming kids, mean parents, caged creatures....ugh..."
1939,5/24/2012,2,"Sear World San Diego in a nutshell:1. Â Horrible Parking Management (System) (14.00) regular / preferred 19.00 (why?)  Â  Â  does not make parking any better.2. The grounds seem worn down and beat up. Â Only thing that looks fresh are the  Â  Â  flowers, which were nice.3. There were signs here and there but most of the time I used the map heavily to  Â  Â  figure out where the entrance even was to a certain exhibit.4. Lunch was 80.00 for elementary school Pizza Food. Â The dough was half baked.  Â  Â Salad was ok, desert was ok...w/ drinks.5. Shamu show was cool...Dolphin show boring and repetitive. Â Half way through the  Â  Â show all you see is people diving over and over and over and over.......you get the idea.... 6. Shark exhibit was a joke...you can see a better shark exhibit Â in Vegas. Â Literally it Â   Â  Â was walking walking walking done. 7. Turtle Reef was pretty cool.8. Â One bad thing about the shark experience and turtle reef are that they are  Â  Â together in the same area. Â So every time you go into one of those exhibits you Â   Â  Â come out the same gift shop. Â I think we went around in circles into the gift shot 3  Â  Â 4 times just trying to navigate through the exhibit.. Â -____-...mmmhmmmmm..can  Â  Â you make it more obvious.9. The Artic Exhibit was the coolest. Â Whales in there are worth watching. Â 10. Some of the rides were ok. Â It was fun but short lived. Â Again poor line  Â  Â  Â  management. And everything looked like it was falling apart. They call is  Â  Â  Â something from Atlantis but I felt like I was in a Mayan temple. 11. Â About the saddest thing I saw were the penguins and the sea lions. Â The  Â  Â  Â penguins were just dead. Â And the sea lions were turning tricks for food while  Â  Â  Â people laughed and enjoyed feeding them. Â It looked interesting until my wife  Â  Â  and I watched everything from the side lines. Â It felt like homeless people  Â  Â  begging for food doing what they can to get it. Â The eyes of the sea lions  Â  Â  looked faded. Â They looked stoned and dazed. Â Not themselves at all.. Â It was  Â  Â  Â really sad to see that. Â Overall, not impressed with Sea World San Diego. Â Will probably not be going back here until they do something about the space and animals. Â The solution is not to build more roller coasters to bring more people in. Â WE go to Sea World to see animals. Â Not go to ride roller coasters. Â When you main attractions are failing..maybe it's time you do something about it."
1940,3/29/2010,2,"This SeaWorld blows! This is the most confusing ""theme park"" of all-time. For the first hour we walked around and there was literally nothing that you could see without waiting in line. No wait, there was...we went in two aquariums. From the crowds inside you would expect these to be jaw-dropping mini-aquatic wonderlands. You would be so sadly wrong.If you have ever been to a terrible non-descript, un-branded aquarium in Florida, take that and think of a third-grader making something similar and then a fourth-grade bully coming along and ruining the whole thing and you would have the two aquariums at SeaWorld San Diego. This is SeaWorld, the world of the ocean and there were two eels, yay. And some other dumb fish that are swimming in every aquarium everywhere. My kids were so bored they were actually mocking the aquarium and I assure you that they are too young to understand how to mock so effectively. These were just two small fishbowls at the World of the Sea.While you walk around here, encountering almost nothing at every step, you wonder why you are doing so much walking. If you take a second to look around you realize that, in all theme-park fashion, there are literally food kiosks every ten steps, followed by a gift shop, followed by a caricature stand. I do understand the business of a theme park, but SeaWorld San Diego is like OCD about it. Popcorn on your right, funnel cake on your left, churros in front of you, hot pretzels bumping into you, but nowhere to be found...actual sea life you can just see, out in the open, without huddling around a bunch of other people just waiting to touch the back of a tiny ray.The saving grace of SeaWorld was the Shamu show. I know what has happened and I do not in any way advocate the retention of killer whales in tiny pools, but in the end, I have kids and said kids like to go to places like this and see things, not to just eat junk food all day. They pose no conscientious objection at this point and the Shamu show was very good. The three whales jump, splash and basically ham it up. If you don't want to get wet, I mean soaked, I mean like falling in the ocean wet, do not sit in the first 16 rows. Without the Shamu show, SeaWorld would have been a one-star park. Maybe some of the amazement of the show was in seeing how wet people got in those first few rows, but whatever works when there is nothing else good to see.Also, the kids area here is pretty nice. Water activities, ropes courses and some fun things for kids under about 8 helped the park dig out of what I thought was money spent on ennui and huge splashes that covered people from head to toe. This place was obviously not worth the money in my opinion and was completely underwhelming in all ways."
1941,8/2/2009,5,"There is so much to say about this theme park so I'll keep it simple...The shows are fantastic! Â About 15 to 20 mins and show so its not too short and not long enough for you to sit there in the sun and get toasted...The Shamu show of course is the best, but I LOVE the new Clyde and Seymore sea lion show SNL style, HILARIOIUS! Â The Elmo 3d show is wonderful too, great for kids and adults!The rides are fun if you don't mind getting WET!!! Â Food is pretty much standard when it comes to theme parks. Â Expensive and cafeteria tasting...Ridiculously overpriced. Â Sometimes they let you bring your own food depending on who checks your bags and if you're sneaky enough...Don't forget to go to the Anheiser Busch spot near the entrance and get your free beer. Â There is alot of other stuff that I am leaving out on purpose, just too much to mention!!! Â Penguins, sharks, dolphins, manta rays, polar bears, OH MY!! Â Theres nothing better than sea world in the summer!!! Â I suggest you get a silver pass (thank you WW!) instead of a fun card because you save more and get discounts and there are no black out dates...Simply put, fun times for you and your family...Great place to go on a date too!! Â I go atleast once a month and never get tired of it. Â SUMMER! Â FUN! WET!"
1942,1/1/2010,4,"Sea World has been open for 45 years and is still going very strong, being San Diego's #1 tourist destination with over 100 million visitors since it opened. The park has a mixture of super slick stadium shows, theater presentations, life-like sanctuary exhibits, hands on interactions, and fun amusement park rides. Â The big draw is Shamu, the 8,000 pound star of 'Free Willie"" a Killer Whale, and his family. They are presented in a super slick production to large capacity only audiences in the Shamu Stadium, at 10, 4 and 7. These productions are like Free Willie meets Jacques Cousteau with Cirque Du Soleil's ""O"" in the Crystal Cathedral. Very scripted, high production value multi-media spectacles with moving large screens, live singers, and impeccable timing and execution. They make Six Flags Vallejo look like Punch and Judy. We saw the 4pm show, entitled ""Believe"", which is sort of like A Purposeful Life meets Dancing with Whales. The 7pm show, dubbed Shamu's Holiday Night, doesn't have Shamu at all, but smaller understudies. It had spectacular behaviors but dangerous human stunts mixed in with the Drama and God and Country of Jim and Tammy Baker with the help of the Lawrence Welk singers and dancers. With visitors from around the world of all religions, Shamu's Holiday Night was more a celebration of Christianity, with songs like"" Joy to the World (Our Lord has Come)"" rather than less hymnal Holiday tunes like Let it Blow (Snow) or Shamu, the White Spotted Orca (Rudolph the Red Nose...you get what I mean). Nobody sang ""Draedle Draedle Draedle, I made it out of clay"" which could have been ""Shamu Shamu Shamu, spinning all the day"" as the Orca's did their spin behaviors. The Dolphins and Pilot Whales put on a good temporary show at Shamu Stadium, as their new Story driven production ""Blue Horizon"" opens up May, 2010. Monterey Bay Aquarium has better aquarium oriented exhibits. The penguin exhibit is meh, the Buluga and Walrus exhibit is great (but cold!), the Flamingo exhibit is more colorful than Wild Animal Park, and the Shark Encounter has a lot of sharks, but not super interesting. Sea World is a great experience for young and old, and once again, the parking is free! (No tram like the big eared guy's place, and I don't mean the White House).But I would like to see better eating places (not all were opened, and half were carts selling popcorn, pretzels and Churros), better crowd flow after Shamu (5,000 people out of two exits isn't ideal), better shops organization, and heated eating areas for the wintertime.They do finger print every person at entry, and salute all armed forces, active, retired or foreign, before every Shamu show. It's great to support our service people (my dad served 25 years) but didn't Sea World/Anheuser Busch sell out to a foreign company? Maybe that's why they acknowledge foreign military service?There once was a girl from AnheuserWho went out to dine with the KaiserHe opened her HammsAnd got into her SchlitzAnd now she's sadder, Budweiser"
1943,5/16/2016,1,I only came because I was a chaperone for my kids field trip. I didn't want to go but I couldn't crush my kids heart. So I informed her of the natural habitats of all the animals there especially the whales. I never in my life have been there so as soon as we walked I to the shamu arena I was crushed soo small their area is! That pool!!!! Is not fit for them!!! And in the show one of the trainers said right now our friend is not following command!! Duh it's a killer whale it belongs in the ocean doing what ever it wants!!!! So they tried to correct her by ignoring her!!!! I was so disappointed more than what I already was!!!! Good thing that my kid knows what a killer whales behavior is!!! I will never go here again I'm glad I only paid $13.00 to go but I will never go again!!! The whales are in poor conditions all the animals are!!! Please stop bringing animals into seaworld just keep these ones and as soon as they go to a better place shut this place down!!!!
1944,8/14/2010,4,"Our family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children under the age of 10) had a summer vacation that was filled with visits to Legoland, Sea World, San Diego Zoo, and Disneyland.Sea World was a fun and amusing part of our trip. Â The entire family enjoyed all the shows. Â However, they are spread across the entire park and we were not able to catch all the shows. Â Since my children are younger they LOVED the Sesame Street play area. The food was good for amusement park food. Â We took advantage to the All-You-Can-Eat bracelets and they truly paid for themselves. Â HIGHLY recommend getting one if you are going to eat at least two meals there. Â The kids' meals portions were a little small for my older kids so they would get two with the bracelet.We paid for the ""premium"" parking and were happy to. Â It got us really close to the front gate. Â However, it is pricey to pay for that parking."
1945,7/10/2013,3,"I think I was expecting more since this was a return trip for me and the last time I had gone, was about 10 years ago. Â Overall okay - they kind of stick it to you with the price of the extras - but I guess that's expected at any amusement park. Â The signs and paths are not clearly laid out so it is pretty easy to get lost and turned around and staff members are few and far between and most of them won't know how to direct you. Â We had a few snafus related to behind the scenes tours and whatnot. Â Oh and if you have to deal with the customer relations office (not sure if that's the name) good luck - I was in there for an hour trying to add someone to a tour."
1946,12/20/2013,5,I love Seaworld. Blackfish preys on those with weak minds that are unable to think for themselves.
1947,6/3/2008,3,"I used to live a few miles from Seaworld long long ago, in the before time. And while the park itself was nice and the animals cute, there were distinct advantages and disadvantages of living so close.Pros -Over the summer they'd have these massive, loud-ass fire work shows every single night! You could see it from our apartment and it would even shake the walls.Cons - Over the summer they'd have these massive, loud-ass fire work shows every single night! You could see it from our apartment and it would even shake the walls. Not so fun when you have to get up at 2am for work and WWII is going on outside!"
1948,9/14/2013,4,Just got home after a full day of fun here at SEA WORLD SAN DIEGO had a good time. Now i have to explain to my grand son why the animals don't live in the ocean.
1949,2/15/2014,1,"When I was here, the animals were displaying a lot of stress behavior like pacing, rocking back and forth, things implying that they weren't stimulated unfortunately. The whales looked listless. Sea World does positive things like animal rehabilitation, this is what they should focus on instead of their animal shows, which are frankly terrible."
1950,7/16/2007,4,"This was my first trip to Sea World and I have to say it was a lot of fun!! Â The shows were sooo entertaining and the exhibits we're interesting! Â I have always loved animals and knew this was the place for me!!Definitely wear clothes that are light like shorts, capris, and short sleeved shirts. Â Definitely wear comfortable sandals!! Â And please save your self from second degree burns and wear sunblock!! Â All of the shows are out in the sun with no overhangs or canopy's so please be prepared!The food was reasonably priced considering this is an amusement park...much cheaper than Disneyland. Â Just watch out for the gulls because they will swipe down and try to steal your food! WOMEN: Â FREE TAMPONS IN THE BATHROOMS!!!! Â YEA!!!Had an awesome time with my hubby, bro, and his gf!"
1951,7/15/2011,4,"we Have been pass members for 4 years now. The older my kids get the more they like it. Some thing have changed since AB sold out to foreign company, some not for the better others ok. we want the trainers back in the water........."
1952,7/8/2010,4,"One time at Marine Land I saw a seagull eat two spareribs, including the bones, that were about 10 inches long.It didn't die.Can't give it 5 stars because the Shamu show is gayer than 6 guys screwing 7 guys. And they took away the free beer."
1953,9/30/2008,4,"As stated earlier in my Yelps, I visited SD a lot as a kid, and Seaworld was always a great way to spend the day there. It is a tad pricey to get in, but you can use the ticket you purchase to come back for another visit by the year's end.It is a huge place, so you may not see it all in one visit. Plenty of great things to do for kids and adults. I suggest that if you do not get into Seaworld type things, to just bring a flask of whiskey, and make the most of it with the wife and kids."
1954,1/12/2009,5,"God I love Sea World. I got buzzed because I had all the beer I could drink, FREE, at the Anheuser Busch Hospitality Center. (Free Beer samples end on 02/01/09). Fricken sweet!I laughed my arce off at the Pet show.I made funny faces at the cute penguins. They all had their back turned to us though. I made mating calls to Dolly the dolphin at the her show. I took a dump at one of their ultra clean restrooms. I mean really clean.I reluctantly dished out $35 for lunch. We had a Jabalaya w/chicken, hotdog kids meal, small salad, 2 pieces of garlic bread, bottle water, small milk, and a fruit punch. Bleh...I loved the Aquarium exhibits. They had loads of salt water and fresh water fishes. I got to see a pretty weak Shamu show. I could of swore they used to launch a trainer into the air when I was a kid. Still amazing to see that killer whale. I was suprised that it wasnt packed on a Saturday. We got the annual pass. No blackouts, 14 months, parking is included, and discounts on food and stuff for $99/person. Oh yeah, I humped a Manatee. SWEEEET."
1955,3/11/2008,4,"Me personally, I'm starting to see how tired this amusement park is starting to get. Â It's needing a face lift soon. Â However, my out of town guests have a great time here and I love bringing my nieces, nephews, and little cousins here. Â We always have a blast. Â Ironically enough, the Shamu show is the worst of all of the shows. Â The best show is the Sea Lions Tonight. Â Food is mediocre and expensive, but you're allowed to bring in your own food. Â I'd recommend you wear swimwear underneath your normal clothing instead of cotton underwear - you're certain to get wet on some ride or show or exhibit at some time. Â The best deals I've found on park tickets are at Costco and AAA. Â There's absolutely no reason to pay full price - it's so easy to take advantage of these deals. Â Every two or three years, we pay just a few dollars extra for a year pass if we were taking friends and family to the park and my husband and I will take a stroll through the park after dark on warm summer nights. Â We'll get our free beer at the hospitality center and afterwards, we take the backwards route through the Arctic gift store so that we can bypass the lame simulated helicopter ride and go straight to the beluga and polar bear exhibits. Â Something about watching the exotic white belugas glide silently and gracefully in the dark waters is very calming. Â If you stand next to the glass and wave, they actually turn their heads to look at you. Â I'm serious!"
1956,10/15/2008,5,"Having two little boys means that I spend a lot of time trying to amuse them. Â When I run out of ideas, I let the pros do it. Â That's right...season passes baby!While weekends are full and the summers are jam packed with Zoners, fall thru spring weekdays and even some weekends are for the locals. Â Lines aren't too bad and you can jump in, catch one show, and leave if you want. Â After all, you can come back tomorrow. Â Anthony, my 3 year old, has an overwhelming urge to see the Shark Encounter, Dolphin Show, Penguins (or as he calls them...'Happy Feet') and the inimitable orca himself: Shamu. Â But no ordinary daytime Shamu Show (entitled 'Believe') will do. Â No, no. Â He wants to see 'Shamu Rocks' which is only offered at night to blaring rock music. Â I actually enjoy the night show more because of the music and the fireworks that follow. Â They do a good job keeping you entertained but there's a lot more video wizardry than actual trick whales. Â You'll watch their marketing propaganda video to get you to buy the 'Shamu Tail' necklace and then splash you with water that's below 50 degrees. Â It's a great experience and definitely a good place for the fam or some friends from out of town. Â Here's the breakdown of the must sees:1. Â Shamu (either show but 'Shamu Rocks' is better)2. Â Sea Lion and Otter Show3. Â Elmo's 4-D (if you have kids and sit in the 10th row or so for better viewing)4. Â Shark Encounter (that tunnel is just too cool)5. Â Wild Arctic (polar bear and beluga whales)6. Â Dolphin Show (also if you have kids...can be a little annoying like Elmo)6. Â If you're killing time...Pets Rule. Â But who really goes to Sea World to see dogs, cats and pigs. Â I can tell you, ""NOT ME!""7. Â If you like really bad American beer, check out the Anheuser Busch Hospitality Center.My boys are too young to get on any of the rides so I wont waste your time lying to you about the ones I like. Â I don't know, never been on 'em. Â It's a good day out and you'll have fun. Â Bring sandwiches, drinks and anything else you can get past security. Â It's a lot cheaper to BYO. Â Best advice: Enter from Ingraham Street, Park in C2. Â Avoid the shops they guide you through (notice I didn't mention the Penguin Encounter because you exit into penguin-marketing central), bring a poncho (if you don't want to get wet), and a waterproof Kodak to capture those thrills and spills. Â Be warned: you will not be able to get the songs from Shamu (either show) out of your head for days so bring something to wipe the cranium clean. Â I recommend a catchy ditty that can clear out about anything else ""Brown Eyed Girl"" by Van Morrisson or the old stand-by, ""Hey Jude"" by the Beatles. Â If you don't clear your head you'll be sorry...trust me, I am.But like and old friend, Sea World is always there when you need it. Â It beats the Zoo (which is also good) but isn't easy on the wallet. Â You may need a valise to carry in the cash you'll spend if you buy bad grub there. Â 5th star honors goes to it for being a great San Diego institution. Â It's one of the few places that everyone knows is here (like the Zoo). Â Thanks for bringing tourist dollars in on the Southwest Airlines Shamu liner. Â If you haven't seen that plane, you aren't from here.On a day when I have two or more hours to kill with the kids, it's the first place I go...after I load my iPod with the two songs mentioned above :D"
1957,9/6/2011,4,"What can I say about Sea World. I like marine animals. So I enjoy coming here. The kids love it. The shows are good but seeing them once is enough. I got the season pass. It was well worth it. If it's too crowded, don't feel bad about leaving cause I can just come another day."
1958,11/25/2012,5,"San Diego's iconic theme park! One of the best places to visit and take away fun memories. The shows are some of the most creative epic sea animal shows known to man. The rides here are very innovative and are related to the sea and water adventures. Manta the new roller coaster is fast exciting and a pleaser for thrill seekers, Â Atlantis is an artistic water ride with a drop and a beautiful manta ray aquarium exhibit adjacent to it, it's a pretty spectacular ride and a definite must when you visit. Shipwrecked Rapids is a fun white water rafting ride that soaks you luckily Sea World has human dryers you can use to dry you off after the ride is over they also have a Volcom and Billabong store attached to the ride selling some of the coolest merchandise I have ever seen it's a really well put together store with cool fashions and the nicest staff: Marianthe and Jonathan helped us they were very helpful and sweet and love their store. My son and his friends and I came out of here with a bag full of great buys!Further more, all the encounters and enclosures are top notch, the dolphins,sharks, manta rays, seals and sea lions, killer whales ... you name it are fabulous to see and explore. The restaurants are diverse and worth every penny I have never been let down be it BBQ, Italian, American Cuisine, Deserts, buffet style Sea World has it and does it to perfection. Sea World also offers a dinner and or breakfast with Shamu and a camp for kids over the summer. Bottom line is if you haven't been here you must go whether it's a date or with family and friends or if you just need a break and want to go on your own accord it's one of the best spots in San DIego to visit. If you're a local Sea World follows the holidays and does a winter theme where you can play in artificial snow( since San Diego doesn't get real snow) and provide holiday activities. We just went to the Spooktacular event they have in October where the kids get to trick or treat in the theme park. Also, they have a fun card specific to San Diego residents that can pay for a day and receive admission for the rest of the year free of charge. Pretty amazing I must say, my family and I love this place!"
1959,7/7/2008,3,"2.5-2.75- Don't know if I'd say this is a ""must"" when visiting San Diego.My wife and I have lived in SD for about a year now, and this was our first time going to Seaworld. Â We went on a Saturday after a holiday (July 4), so the wait for things may have been a little worse than normal, but we were still happy to go check this place out.The best way for me to describe this place is half aquarium, half amusement park, with shows sprinkled in between. Â There were maybe 3 or 4 ""rides"" and the exhibits for the most part were pretty quick in and out. Â I actually felt like the exhibits were things that could've been in the SD Zoo.We managed to catch a few shows while we were there- Circque de Mer (wack), something with a submarine theme and sea lions (ok), Shamu:Believe (ok), and the dolphins (cool). Â Each of the shows is roughly 20 minutes or so, and they run continuosly throughout the day. Â We didn't stay for the night shows, but we had already spent 8 hours at the park, and didn't feel the need to stay for another 1 or 2 just to see the 20 minute shows.Overall- kinda disappointing. Â I guess I was expecting more rides, and better shows, but they were not to be had. Â Journey to Atlantis was fun, but nothing so memorable. Â If you have a limited time in SD, don't put this on your to do list. Â If you have more time, I would say this place is more for kids than adults, so if you have no kids, consider some alternatives."
1960,12/6/2008,1,"Seaworld has certainly gone downhill in the past couple years. My original rating was five stars. Now one star. The employees are much more jaded than when AB owned the park, and it feels like it's run by the Gestapo. The following are a string of issues over the past year:We went there one day at 6pm in August only to find the park closed... summer hours were cancelled and it wasn't even Labor Day! Â My 3 year old was very upset. The soulless college student at the exit was yelling at all the people who were walking up to enter the park. Fortunately we had a zoo pass, and went there instead because they still had summer hours.The Christmas theme this year is dominated by loud blasting holiday music. We could barely have a conversation at the table during dinner, and my ears were ringing after the holiday Shamu show. The old dolphin show was a lot of fun and 80% dolphins. The new dolphin show is 20% dolphins, and 80% video, humans, and music. Several people around us commented on the lack of dolphins.Getting out of the parking lot is f'd up beyond belief. Â If you happen to be parked on the wrong side of the exit, they force you into the lanes that exit to the right onto Seaworld Drive, even if you want to go the other way. Unless you really know your way around that area, this will probably cause you to get lost. For some reason, they've reconfigured the paths inside the park. If you still believe that you enter the park and hang a left to quickly get to the Shamu show, then you are in for an unpleasant surprise. You now enter the park, go right, walk through the gaming area, and then through about half the park before finally arriving at Shamu stadium. Be sure to bring a GPS unit and provisions. The signage in the park hasn't kept up with the new paths. We were trying to get to a restroom for my 3 year old. We kept following the arrows, which led us in a circle without an actual bathroom. My daughter was in pain and crying when she couldn't hold it in anymore. We won't renew our annual pass. The zoo is cheaper, and Legoland is definitely more fun for young kids."
1961,5/20/2010,3,"-LONG line for Journey To Atlantis ride. Didn't move very quickly.-Food was expensive and not that great.-Wish they had more rides.-I like the shark exhibit, but people stand there and don't move.-Shamu show is ok, not like I remembered as a kid.-Penguin exhibit smells weird.-Merchandise is expensive, but I guess that is common for any theme-park.-Lots of long lines. Very crowded."
1962,7/19/2011,5,I love their Samu and their new dolphin show. You can try to feed and train their Dolphin but you have to buy tickets it think it was overpriced. Something I don't want to remember.I got student discounted price at UCI item and $55 for a two-day admission is great! The place is huge and you will need to come back to finish watching all the shows and seeing all their animals.
1963,12/8/2010,5,"I did make it down for my second visit. Â In December, you can really move quickly thru the park. Â I should have stayed longer, but I was hoping to get to see the sunset at La Jolla cove.In December, they definitely get into the holiday spirit. Â They have a very tiny ice rink to skate on, and a few backdrops for your Seaworld Christmas card.For you photo buffs, they let you bring in your best equipment."
1964,1/26/2009,2,"I've waited 27 years to come to Seaworld! Â Well, maybe not so much waited, as much as I just haven't been here until I turned 27...and I guess technically it would only be 22 years since I only have lived in California for that long... Â Anyway, Seaworld was still pretty disappointing. Â First of all, the 2 main attractions, Atlantis and the Sky Tower were both down. Â Now if you've been to Seaworld, taking 2 attractions away is like 25% of the park experience - this park is so damn little with so little to do, it makes a big difference not to have those available. Â What I also thought was really disappointing was the Shark Encounter exhibit. Â It was incredibly tiny and the 360 immersion area was such a short ride on the people mover! Â I mean, it's been a long time since I've seen the commercials for this attraction, but I remember them making it out to be this huge and great attraction - in reality, it's just a big fish tank and it's probably not even as deep as an olympic swimming pool. Â Poor sharks and what a crock.I think the only redeeming quality of my visit was the dolphin show, which was quite amazing. Â They truly do a great job with the training and as far as I can tell, it seems like they treat those animals pretty well. Â I'll probably be back to check out the Shamu show and a few others we didn't see but only because we got a free annual pass for buying a single day pass...otherwise, I think I'd just stick to Disneyland._________________________*P.S. Â They don't have the Anheuser Busch Hospitality Center for free beers anymore...that would surely have added at least one star!"
1965,7/23/2008,4,"We came for our niece's sixth birthday, as this is what she requested. Â I thought it would be like Marine World in Northern CA, but I was pleasantly surprised. Â The shows were actually very entertaining (better than Marine World), though quite short. Â Our favorite show was at the end with the killer whales and the fireworks; we actually saw two killer whale shows and one dolphin show. Â Besides that, the kids rode on kiddie rides -- think spinning cups and kiddie roller-coasters. Â And they had some great exhibits: sharks, aquarium. Â But my favorite was the bat ray exhibit where you get to actually PET the rays!My least favorite part of the park was the giant playground; the park needs to do something about the playground -- scary! Â Kids can (and do) get lost in the play area. Â There is this giant net area that they climb up, then a set of tubes to crawl through -- great, except adults don't fit through them... so you can follow them all the way to these tubes, then you have to go back down and pick up your kids at the exits. Â Sounds fine, right? Â Well, no... there are multiple exits! Â And when you have more than one kid going through the maze of tubes, it's scary. Â Thank you to that nice couple who found our four year old son and brought him to lost and found! Â -1 star to Sea World for designing a play area that is guaranteed to lose kids. Â The rest of the play area was fine -- water area, jumpy area, etc. Â It's just those DARN net/tube/maze things that scared years off my life!Also -1 star for that lady that was managing the parking in the first stall. Why did you have to process ONE car to everyone else' s THREE cars? Â No wonder our lane had a traffic jam!But +1 star for the best food that I've ever had at an amusement park. Â The BBQ restaurant was GREAT, with large portions (get the sample plate and the souvenir cup -- $1.50 refills all day long)."
1966,8/23/2011,3,"Since moving here to San Diego I have been here 3 times and every time I visit, I just have to see the penguins ^_^ love them! The recent dolphin show with the acrobats was a little too 'sweet' for me, and they could've show cased the animals more than the people prancing and diving everywhere.Love it how we can interact and feed the sea-lions all day till 6pm. Â But beware of the nasty seagulls that lurk and snip at your hands from those tasty fishy treats.Last visit to sea world i didn't ride on the amusement park rides as from my previous experience of ques on that log ride (??) were an astounding 1HR LONG!!"
1967,9/15/2011,3,"I have a 17 mo old, who wants to walk and run everywhere! I would wait on this age to bring ur babe here. We can't see any of the shows because he won't sit for that long. He loved the Sesame Street area though. Oh and the food is nasty! Also, they have Pepsi so, well that explains itself! Bring snacks and drinks in your bags!"
1968,2/10/2015,5,I love sea world! Nowhere else could I go and learn so much while seeing these animals. I'm so appreciative of this place and just bought my two year annual pass! The new rides add a fun thrill while the new shark and mantra exhibits add fun interaction!
1969,6/27/2014,1,"Be careful signing up for their 1 year payment plans. They automatically renew them, and refuse to refund any money once you find out."
1970,9/2/2016,3,"We have been coming here since we moved to California in 1969. When the beer company owned it, this was a fabulous place. The big horses would be close by the entrance and you could touch them, although they could bite. There were flowers everywhere. They were always adding new attractions. It was expensive to be sure but I felt it was worth it. We went close to the end of August. It was a weekday and school was in session. As a result it wasn't crowded and lots of food stands were closed. The ones that were opened were for people who paid the extra money to eat all day long. We didn't. Â First of all several of the attractions did not open on time because they were having trouble getting them going. The people who worked there were not friendly as all when asked why the rides weren't running. Next, we rented a motor scooter because we have trouble walking. The battery quit. We spoke to a worker who said she would call for help. She didn't. After twenty minutes my husband when back to the front when they rented the scooters. They said no one had notified them that we needed help. We got another scooter but it was a hassle walking all the way back when we had walking issues. Finally, some of the attractions that we used to love were gone. They used to have a 4D pirate show with water squirting you in the face. It was so much fun. It's gone. The flowers and beautiful landscaping are also gone. The animal shows like the one with the whales are now mostly educational. The whales don't jump high for balls handing in the air anymore. The dolphin show was actually boring. Because of the bad publicity, everything has been tamed down. I guess we have the people from ""blackfish"" to blame for this. I won't be surprised if the park ends up closing. It's still pretty expensive for a family and sadly, it's no longer worth it. It's really too bad. Seaworld was a great place to go."
1971,8/2/2009,4,"I love SEAWORLD! I was here yesterday :P I absolutely LOVED the Dolphin show. The Shamu Believe wasn't AS good as the Dolphin show. I was too late to attend the Sea Lion & Otter show. The Pet show was LOVELY, I love the idea of adopting all the animals from shelters & training them...they do love the animals. It was so funny because in the beginning when the dogs run around, and they play the ""WHO LET THE DOGS OUT"" song..one of the dogs fell & hit his head :( poor baby... The circus show is frickin cool, too! Sea World is a must come to.-1 star because I'm cheap & everything cost an arm & a leg. A beer was $5... =[ and I'm a binge drinker.....F I'm broke! haha"
1972,12/16/2013,4,Fun Place to go with the kids for a day... If you've never been - take a day and enjoy!! Just don't go on the weekend. It's packed on Sat & Sun.
1973,6/17/2013,5,Just did a Southern California vacation theme park trip. Felt that Sea World was one of the best things we did. Best food out of all the theme park places.
1974,2/13/2013,5,All time's favorite when visiting San Diego. Great place to spend with your family.
1975,4/22/2011,2,"Much of the park seems old and worn out. I was surprised at how horrible the dolphin and Shamu shows were. They were really corny (more so than I remembered) and it didn't seem like anything actually happened--I think the animals unionized and bargained for fewer work hours. The food was low quality and it took forever to get anything, even at the carts. I would only consider going if it was for kids that had never experienced this type of park before. As an adult, I was very disappointed."
1976,6/1/2014,5,Had a lot of fun going here. Â I wish people would stop judging SeaWorld because Â of one documentary. Â That's what wrong with our country today. People are so easily persuaded by the media. Do your own research and make up your mind and stop using one movie as your primary source. It makes you sound extremely ill informed and it's pretty insulting to other people that you would think they are dumb enough to believe everything one movie says. Â Get off your high horses and go volunteer or something.
1977,7/10/2007,5,"Seaworld provided a pretty perfect introduction to all sorts of sea life for my 5, 3 and 1 year olds... so both they and I loved our day there.Highlights:1. Feeding and patting the dolphins2. Feeding and patting the bat rays3. Killer whale show4. Holding the sea stars, urchins and sea cucumbers5. Underwater shark tunnel6. Dolphin show7. Aquarium with tropical tanks (yes, clown fish are often referred to as Nemo in our family)Recommendations:- Look for coupons before you go. Â We were able to save $10 a piece on admission.- Go in with the right expectations... this is like a big aquarium with some showmanship, not an amusement park.- Suck it up and pay $5 to feed the dolphins or rays. Â Yeah, it's pricey, but how often do you have this opportunity?- Try to go mid-week. Â We went on a Wednesday in June and the crowds were very manageable (e.g., plenty of seats for whale and dolphin shows)."
1978,12/10/2009,4,"I love Sea World! Although I had a season pass for a year, it never got old, and I felt like there was always something different to see. Por ejemplo: one time Shamu attacked a pelican that landed in his tank...attacked as in ""chomp chomp adios pelican"" and then a few feathers floated to the top. I was like ""Wow it's like Shark Week but in person!!!!"" but I am sure some kids were traumatized. Â If you're in a bad mood, a visit to the sea otters will cement the smile to your face. They are too cute for words. The penguin exhibit is also a lot of fun, watching them hop around in their little tuxedos is always great. A surprising good time was had on the roller coaster Atlantis. It is one of the more fun rides I have been on in a long time. You basically get drenched though, so this ride is recommended for hot and sunny days, or be prepared to turn into a human popsicle. I've tried it during winter, and only barely lived to talk about it. **I am from California and winter here is COLD--no ojections. :)**If your season pass runs out, but you are just dying to go on Atlantis because you love it so very much, you can request a 15-minute ""shopping"" pass into the park. In the off-season, this is about the amount of time needed to run in, ride Atlantis, and make it out in time. Not that I've ever done this (cough cough) but you know...you could."
1979,7/30/2014,1,"SeaWorld All Day Dining Deal is it worth it? Depends. It costs $38.99 and $33.99 if you buy online up to 24 hours in advance before park opens. You have to select the day you plan on attending. In order to make the most of your deal is to skip breakfast and go straight to the park and eat all your meals there. You get one entrÃ©e, one side or dessert, and one non alcoholic drink. If you order a kids dining deal it's (ages 3-9) it will cost $17.99 and they will only have the option of chicken nuggets, hot dog and a small drink. Children under 3 can eat free off of your plate.Check the SeaWorld website because you can't just eat anywhere as there are only 4 participating restaurants. CafÃ© 64 which serves hand crafted burgers, Calypso Smokehouse which has bbq ribs,chicken, Caesar with a smoked chicken quarter. Â There is a restriction on the baby back ribs and the surf and turf of which you can pay a few dollars extra if you want. You can get the spareribs though. Mama Stella which has pizza and pasta and lastly is Shipwreck Reef CafÃ© which serves carved meat sandwiches, salmon, salad with shrimp Â and a bad fish and chips. There are some other items that I did not list for the participating restaurants but this gives you a general idea.Is it worth it? Well the normal food costs at the park costs from about $9.00 on up to about $15.00 or so, drinks around $3.00 give or take and sides and desserts cost a few dollars also. So if you eat three meals with drinks and a side or dessert then you will break even or come out ahead depending on what you get. If you are the one that normally buys food and drinks in the parks then it might be worth it. If you are the one that normally brings your own food and drink then you will still be better off doing that. Why? Because with the hot sun and sucking down fluids you really don't feel like eating that much where you will be wasting food and you won't really eat your moneys worth. But the main reason why the All Day Dining isn't worth it is because you are only allowed one entrÃ©e, one drink, one side or dessert per entry at a time. That means you have to go through the line again if you want seconds. And if you were thinking you can just grab some fruit or a simple bottle of water anytime you felt like it, forget it! You ""have"" to stand in the long slow Â line again to just get a bottle of water. The staff cant keep up and you would literally stand in line for 30 minutes or longer for just a water as there isn't an express line just for drinks. On top of that, you would have to go to one of the spread out 4 participating restaurants. And charging a child adult prices for a child 10 and older is ridiculous. So if you have a family with 10 year olds on up in your group you will lose money at the tail end. Â If you have teenage to early 20 year old boys then it might make sense. Then again that's if you have time to stand in line each time you want a meal or just a simple drink. The shows times are spaced really close together so you don't have much time in between shows to line up for a meal so you end up trying to cram your number of meals in a short time frame to make it worth it but you aren't very hungry because of that. And the last frustrating part of the deal is that all the restaurants close at 9:30 except for Mama Stella's which closes at 11 p.m when the park closes on Saturdays. You will have a smaller window of opportunity on the other days of the week when the parks close at 10:00 of which I assume the restaurants close even earlier. Â So if you want to catch dinner before the park closes then you better plan on getting in line early because everyone else is planning on doing the same thing. The deal sounds good on paper but in reality the experience isn't worth the hassle. We thought we could grab some fruit and drinks when we wanted to in between meals that would of made it worth it, but the stand in long slow moving line policy blew that out of the water. If you go early when the park opens it will be the only time you can have shorter line. Stock up on water then, forget about stocking up on soft drinks because they come in paper cups and not bottles.A SeaWorld representative responded to my review and wrote that the Dining Deal was intended for guests that spend the whole day at SeaWorld. Well I did spend the whole day from opening till close. They just need to add an express line or have a cart outside for just drinks and maybe a fruit cup also and that will make the deal a little more reasonable, but they know they can make more money by making it difficult for people."
1980,6/12/2013,5,"SeaWorld! I was fascinated on how organized parking was!!! So get there early especially if it is your first time! Not many rides in here as Disney but its an experienced, complete the last show of Shamu which is there best!! You must stay in the splash zone because its awesome!! HAHA! The manta ride which assuming is the latest they release is pretty crazy! Sit in the end if you want to fill the whip lash!! You must do the rapids and be advise people will shoot you so if you are wearing something nice in seaworld expect it to get wet!!!! Feed the flamingos, try the dots ice cream, visit the shark encounters and just enjoy! This is great learning experience for kids and pre teens that have not seen this type of animals! I love seaworld and will surely visit again!!"
1981,1/8/2011,5,"First time ever to Sea World and I must say I enjoyed every second of the entire day! Â I will definitely go again when I make another trip to San Diego. Â I have always enjoyed seeing aquatic life and learning about all things ocean...Just seeing the Shamu show is worth going, seeing the huge killer whales do back flips, front flips, twists, jumps and other amazing feats simply blows me away. Â  The dolphin show is really cool with lots of high flying acrobatics, water cannons, smoke and high diving. Â The sea lion show is hilarious and had me laughing pretty good several times throughout the show.The various rides and other things to see are all really enjoyable as well. Â All in all sea world is one of the few fun parks that you actually get your moneys worth."
1982,6/30/2011,5,"Handi-capable parking reasonable distance from Ticketing. Â Wheelchairs available for rent. Â Crowds make it difficult to use them, or crutches though so make a plan with your group to clear a path for you to follow in! Â Beware: lazy parents let their kids run around and they could trip you or get hit by your chair....ugh. Â (seriously, why would parents allow that????)Don't be in a hurry here! Â Arrive 30 minutes before shows for better seats.The Shamu ""Splash Zone"" is a serious splash zone! Â Even the Wheelchair seats got some water! Â It's so beautiful to see though and the new show with the trainers out of the water is very good! Â I liked the modifications they made! Â Be well Killer Whales!"
1983,9/17/2010,2,"I guess you can say that I am totally in love with my memories of Sea World. I had visited a few times as a child and this place along with the Vancouver Aquarium really stoked my interest in all sorts of creatures from the sea. Boy, do memories betray you. Coming to Sea World as an adult was really disappointing. Along with the price of admission and parking, there is a push to purchase all you can eat food for the day, tickets for other moving rides and of course all sorts of merch with every sort of animal they own on it. As other reviewers have stated it is an amusement park. It is not designed at all to educate, conserve or mimic the animal environment for the viewing public. It is instead designed to sell anything they can through exploitation of these captive animals. This is still one of the only places that still has killer whales in captivity and they were certainly the highlight of my experience here. The show was pretty cheesy with some storyline incorporating 1 child from the audience into the show. How beautiful these whales are! How sorry was I to contribute to their miserable existence in tiny square tanks (anything is small compared to the ocean!) behind the show stadium. I was so sad to see them were living in such barren and isolated conditions. I guess my feeling about Sea World is hate/like a little (because getting so close to orca is not an everyday occurrence). Go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for a real aquatic educational experience. Come here if you don't care about animals and just want to be amused. I will not be returning."
1984,5/27/2013,4,"Today was the first time I went back to SeaWorld in a decade and I actually had a lot more fun than I anticipated. The Shamu and Dolphin shows were well choreographed and interesting, as was the wannabe Circus Soleil like water show. The park was clean and even had some new rollercoasters. They have a great deal for Southern Cal residents which is $78 for entry and getting the rest of the year free(with a few blackout dates). Parking is $15."
1985,7/16/2013,3,"It's a great place to visit every once in a while. Â I came for the second summer in a row with work. Â It was the Friday after July 4th, so it was really crowded. Â I went on a few rides and watched a couple shows, then I read for a while. Â The animals are great."
1986,7/17/2011,3,"My favorite show was the Sea Lion Show.. hmmm..what's wrong with this picture? Â Why was it my favorite..because the comedy provided by one of the hosts of the show prior to the sea lion show kept the crowd entertained and laughing... like another reviewer, the dolphin show was ridiculously Cirque du Soleil like.... my 7 year old enjoyed the shamu show but i felt like there was more show about ""save the environment"" and then have the whales splash the crowd a little to appease their desire to be splashed......definitely not the show i remember as a kid..but my daughter enjoyed it..so that's all that matters.... it was very deceiving in san diego.. kinda overcast in the morning..cool breeze...but of course, every show we sat and watched,..we were frying in the sun and yes even with sunblock,..still ended up sunburnt and partially tanned too... look around on the web for ticket deals..i think the website was mousesavers.com..or something of the sort.... . the one we got was great..but one adult ticket and get a free kids ticket... and then another discount for regular adult tickets was marked down $20...."
1987,7/15/2013,4,"Sea World was really fun. I went to three different shows throughout the day - the whale one, dolphins, and last but not least the sea lions. The sea lions was my favorite! They are such smart funny animals. Loved it!"
1988,4/10/2007,5,"edit: 5 stars, for making a left instead of going to there the parking attendant was directing people to park, we didn't have to walk as far! and they just openned journey to atlantis so...no line!So I decided to buy the SILVER PASSPORT, $94(somewhere around there) paid in monthly installments of $7.53? But you can pay it whole if you'd like. FREE PARKING, and 10% all food and merchandise. Or you can purchase the funcard pay for a day and go for free until the end of the year; excludes free parking, so you'd have to pay $10(cars/trucks/vans) each time you go. FUNNEL CAKE :] mmmWe ate at this one place near the Dolphin Stadium...kinda expensive/kinda cheap...find me an ""amusement/theme park"" that sells cheap food. Please do. The brisket was delicious. I HEART frozen lemonade. Which Shamu is this, #5?People can get pushy when you're trying to pet the batrays or pick up the starfish, if they do..splash water on them(without them knowing) hahaha I JUST WANT TO PET THE DAMN ANIMAL! don't push, say ""excuse me."" You can feed the dolphins and batrays, for $5Journey to Atlantis, you get wet; really wet if you sit in the front :(Shipwreck Rapids, you get wetter.Wild Artic, gave me a headache.R.L Stine Haunted Lighthouse, surprises you.Dolphin show, Shamu show, Sealion show, etc. interesting.Go buy a Funcard/Silver passport. p.s. the cirques thing they have during summer is entertaining."
1989,4/7/2011,5,Love this place !!I loved shows & rides.IT WAS JUST AWESOME!
1990,1/24/2007,2,"Did you know it costs like $50 to go to Sea World? I love the ocean, I love fish, I love to snorkel and I love Shamu, but I don't want to pay $50 bucks to watch a killer whale, one that is suppose to be roaming the oceans, in a fish tank. Also, I don't want to see a Sea World trainer get thrashed around by little old Shamu. So in that case, if I want to see fish, I'm going to pocket the $50 and bust out my snorkel gear and head out to the La Jolla Cove. I would suggest you all do the same, but that damn place is getting too crowded."
1991,2/4/2011,3,"EDIT: We went back 2 years later, this past January of 2013, and it was much better. Not like 15-20 years ago, but definitely better than our visit in 2011. Shamu show is a bit better and the dolphin show is a bit better. Wonder if they got lots of feedback. Also they have a couple of cool rides that the kids enjoyed. Moved from 1x to 3x stars.#######################################[Original 2011 review]Oh the horror. Do not go to Sea World until they restore their wonderful past. I was so excited to return to Seaworld. It had been about 10 years since my last visit. I absolutely loved this place during each of my past visits.Now, I regret having gone this past visit, because not only was it a completely lame experience, but it tarnished my past memories as well.Here's the deal. The two best shows from my memories were the amazing Dolphin show and the jaw dropping Shamu show. The other shows were good, but let's be serious, its all about the dolphins and Shamu.Well, the Shamu show is total garbage. Its not even worth spending your time sitting in the stadium while the while swims around its tank. Now then, this is quite forgivable given the events which took place last year in Florida with the killer whale there killing a trainer. I understand. I can see why the show went to total crap while they figure out what to do.What is not forgivable is the dolphin show. Apparently this show was not altered (from what I was able to ascertain). To the contrary, they actually choreographed a bunch of stupid amateur divers jumping into the Dolphin tank while the animals are nowhere to be seen. I was in utter disbelief. The show is really terrible. Its as bad as the hastily re-worked and gutted Shamu show, without the understandable excuse. Here's the spoiler. Dolphins swim out, say hello, do 5 minutes of small tricks, then you watch about 15 minutes of lame divers in costumes jumping into the water, with the animals no where in site. Meanwhile, there I am apologizing to my wife and kids for having hyped up the show, explaining, ""they used to have the Dolphins in the show!""In the end, it is no longer worth visiting this park. Its a wasted day, a waste of money, and a good shot at having long term regret and tarnished memories from times past.Let's all hope that Seaworld can re-claim its past wonder. I really miss the dolphins, and I miss the Killer Whale show too."
1992,5/23/2013,4,"SeaWorld is so awesome! It's kind of pricey for what you get, so make the most of the day. I'd definitely eat before and after going too because there's no good food available there. But SHAMU is still spectacle!!!"
1993,11/28/2008,4,"My fondest memory of Seaworld would be when I was seven, and I was innocently standing there holding a drumstick that my mom probably paid 10 dollars for ( and not one of those five pound turkey legs like at the del mar fair ) when a vicious seagull swoops down and snatches that thing from my tiny little hands.However, I do love the starfish and the manta ray. Â We love when Sean sings in the dolphin show, and I know I have a picture of Dallas as a mime somewhere."
1994,7/10/2009,4,"When I was 15 years old, a friend and I went to Sea World to hang out, have some fun, and hopefully see some good lookin' girls.I ran across a girl who I thought was beautiful. I was immediately in some form of lust or love. My buddy and I stalked her and her friend all day long. I was pretty shy back in the dizay and still am but I hoped she might notice me and maybe come talk to me. Maybe she might say hi. Maybe we would fall in love and be together forever...Needless to say we didn't but while following her I got to see much of the park and had a genuine good time...I like this place and I think I always will....Cheers to you Shamu!"
1995,7/2/2011,4,"I really love watching the animals and the trainers.  I can do without the few rides they have. If you do not space out the time frame to see the shows, you'll either miss one or you'll be rushed and because there is not much else to see, you might get bored. The best show that involves animals is Blue Horizons as it is a ""themed"" show. It combines Â Dolphins, exotic birds, pilot whales, women and men dancing/diving, and other beautiful carefully crafted moves. It's a combination of entertainment and Stage performance. A 20 out of 10, plus a ton of fun!! If you have a large family that eats a lot, consider the ""all eat"" pass but read the fine print.  seaworldparks.com/en/seaâ€¦"
1996,6/30/2014,3,"I came here on Saturday, I havent been here in so long it changed but I still feel nostalgic there. The little bag check was quick. The food is expensive as always but the churros are a must have although its 4.09 a piece aka really pricey compared to Costco churro its worth every penny! We waited for journey to atlantic for like 30 mins...The man didnt know when it would start back up but we waited anyways because there was a huge line formed behind us and we waited that long so why not the inital wait time was like 50 mins. The ride was really fun and a thriller. The seasme water park thing was a bummer for the kids..There wasnt much water as imagined from all the ads. The manta ride was by far the longest line for a ride at seaworld, but it went real quick. Right when me and my friend sat down on the ride and pulled the little things down the ride was stuck. Thank you based god we didnt even go half way yet. We were able to pop out of our seat and stand back in line while poor others were stuck in the middle of the roller coaster. I removed two stars due to the ride malfunctions and overly packed shows."
1997,10/31/2009,2,"This is not a place for me. Â The overwhelming number of kids and babies alone should have had me running the other way. Â But, I was with my brother and his family and since he has started having babies, we all do what the kids want to do on vacations. Â :(Being that he is military, he and his whole family got in for free. Â My parents and I got a 20% discount but it was still really expensive.My brother's kids are really little and this park was probably not the best for their age group (2-3yrs). Â We did go to the Sesame Street area and they had a little fun but most of the things were just too big for them.We then decided to head over to the whale tanks to see the Shamu show. Â Too bad the kids were too wiped out and fell asleep before the whales even started flipping and diving. Â It was an interesting show but these sorts of things always make me feel bad for the animals.I am not a kid person, never will be. Â This is a park that has mass amounts of space throughout the site just to park your strollers. Â The screaming whiners and snotty faces were enough to make me wish I was somwhere else..somewhere full of adults. We really should have saved this spot for when the kids are older because they were just too tired/overwhelmed for a space this big. Â Or...we should have just saved it for when Auntie Sarah could go do her own thing while the little punks went in to play."
1998,10/12/2014,2,"DO NOT ask a park photographer, an old guy with glasses near the SeaWorld sign outside, who intentionally takes pictures in wrong ways, e.g., taking a movie instead of picture or cutting out the SeaWorld sign."
1999,12/14/2013,1,"Whether you live in San Diego or are a visitor avoid this place. I live here and will not longer take visiting friends there. There are a lot of better things to do in San Diego then go to SeaWorld and here are the reasons why.1. SeaWorld is obscenely overpriced, we are talking $84 for an adult and $78 for a child and that is just to get in the door. You still have to pay for everything else. If you want to spend the day at SeaWorld budget at least $150 per person and that's being stingy and not splurging on anything.2. The park is way too crowded. You will be bumping (and having people bump into you) all day. You will spend 80% of your time waiting in line and only 20% of your time doing something. You will wait to get in the park, wait to see shows, wait to get on rides, wait to buy food, wait to buy souvenirs, wait to go to the bathroom.... basically you will wait for everything you want to do in the park. And once you get in the animal exhibits (polar bears, penguins, sharks, dolphins....) there are so many people you won't be able to get close to the glass and see anything. The little kid with the killer whale behind the glass smiling a each other that is only in the commercial people, it won't happen when you go there because of the crowding conditions.3. The food is bad and overpriced. I had a tasteless hotdog with a coke for $12 (a good one at Costco will set you back $1.62 and it is bigger with refills on the drink). So if you insist on visiting that tourist trap my advice would be eat before you go.4. The animal shows are sad and depressing. While you watch the killer whale think about how you would feel if you had to be trapped in a hot tub for thirty years, the dimensions are about right.5. Talking about killer whales... the Shamu show is incredibly boring since trainers no longer go in the water. They just don't do anything anymore except play music and splash the crowd.6. The gift shops are another rip off. ?17.99 for a little magnet you can get anywhere else in San Diego for a quarter Â of the price, it just won't have SeaWorld written on it."
2000,4/24/2007,4,"I have a Platinum Passport here (about $12/month) and try to visit at least 1X/3 months or so.The things I always do:1. Feed the dolphins. Â For about $5 you get a little tray of fish and get to get really close-up to feed them. Â Beware though because the accompanying seagulls are intelligent enough to headbutt the fish right out of your tray as the signs and personal experience attest. Â But I think that $5 to pet a dolphin vs. the big $$$ Dolphin Discovery thing is far more reasonable. Â Feeding only happens like 2X/day though and there are limited spots but if you are in one of the last couple of people you usually get to hang out with the dolphins longest of all.2. Watch the dolphin and Shamu shows. Â I was there for the 1st public viewing of the ""Shamu Rocks!"" show. Â Silly title but a very enjoyable show. Â Stay out of the splash zone unless you have a fetish for 55 degree cetacean wee.3. Funnel cake. Â Oh, how I wish they had a lunch version with a spicy tomato & meatball sauce or stewed chicken but the dessert variety is just fine.I think that Journey To Atlantis is just alright. Â No big allure for me. Â The rapids ride is only fun with a group of friends IMHO. Â The 4D Haunted Lighthouse is always good for a laugh and Platinum Passports get head of the line priority for it."
2001,1/31/2008,2,"It was raining the day I went and I spent $12 on a poncho. Â Best $12 I ever spent in my life. Â Why? Because I was later pooed on by a seagull flying overhead. Â Yeah, that's about all I remember about my trip to Sea World 5 years ago. I'm not big on marine life, so it was a bit boring for me. Their commericals make it look all amazing, and Free Willy was great product placement, but it's boring. The place isn't that big so you can walk it all in a few hours. Â The Shamu show is fun; expect to get wet in the splash zone.That same night, I had sushi for the first time. Ah, the circle of life."
2002,6/4/2013,5,My daughter loves this place so that's all that matters... prices though are a little high 8(
2003,6/30/2010,4,"I was very surprised at the price for this place. I thought it ran like $30 per person + parking. Got a great deal and I am glad we went. My 2 year old still talks about Shamu. He loved Sesame Street were he was able to get on all the rides (with parent). I was surprised that he could do the net area. Loved the pet show and Shamu. Wasn't crazy for the Sea Lion (I wasn't crazy about it either). The Dolphin show was closed which is one of my favorites. Our deal was for 2 days which was great cause we didn't rush through everything. We packed lunch and left it in the car ate lunch outside in picnic table area. For snacks we put them in stroller in the pockets. They only checked the backpacks. Things I disliked - no food allowed. When families are in tight budget it's hard enough to pay for the entry and parking. When we left I wish they would of stamped my wrist not back of hand it washes off easily. The entry process. You have to put your thumb print down on this machine and your ticket on this scanner - no big deal, but it wasn't reading it and the attendant was busy daydreaming and I gave me the ugliest look when I bothered her. socalpocketmemories.blogâ€¦ facebook.com/socalpocketâ€¦"
2004,4/22/2013,4,"Fun place to view sea animals, but wish there were more attractions or shows. $15 parking sucks."
2005,10/21/2010,4,"Sea World has captured my heart for as long as I can remember. Through the renovations and upgrades and years of building upon building I have been enjoying every bit of it. My son LOVES Elmo's play area, that I used to love and refer to as Captain Kids World. There are ropes to climb on, floating sidewalks, water features, jumping features, games, funky mirrors, rides, slides... I mean this place is like heaven for both parents and kids... Kids are entertained while mommy enjoys a nice refreshing adult beverage... You picking up what I am putting down? The shows are fun the first couple of times, but for the most part when I go we go straight for Journey to Atlantis, then Shipwreck rapids, then to pet the dolphins and the bat rays, see the sharks, and the penguins, the beluga whales (my favorite), and end with a ride on the sky tower to view the whole city.Everyone in the family usually gets a fun card with one person getting an annual membership (for free parking and discounts that are offered) This year I was able to get 2 year pass for the price of 1. So that is AWESOME!!! Unfortunately I just moved away, but have visited 3 times since getting it and have already surpassed the cost of the pass, so I'm pleased and I still have over a year and a half left! Sea World is so educational and their dedication to preserving the wildlife of these animals is honorable. Educating people and the next generation is truly the only way that life for many of these animals will continue. They have part in so many relief efforts and in the breeding of endangered or near endangered sea life that I'm proud of Sea World. My son has such a love for these animals through the hands on interaction that he has not been able to get anywhere else. Sea World has made it personal for him. I do miss the Clydesdales... but oh well... BTW this was also where I had my first real job when I was 16 years old back in the summer of 1998 at Cascades that then turned into Mango Joe's. It was awesome then too.* Food can get fairly pricey, but with an annual pass you get a 10% discount."
2006,5/15/2007,5,"THE AMISH GO HERE!(I only feel comfortable admitting this online because I know The Amish will never read it.) Â I am NOT kidding ... last time my friend and I were at Seaworld, we sat next to an AMISH FAMILY at the Seal & Otter Show. Â Who knew that The Amish would make this the best theme park around?!We sneakily followed them around for the rest of the day like crazy people (us, not them). Â When I went to take a picture, the man of the group casually posed, slowly stroking his long beard. Â And our conversation teemed with questions like, ""Is their buggy in the parking lot?"" Â Oh yeah ... Seaworld ROCKS!"
2007,11/16/2014,5,"Me and my daughter went to sea world this weekend we had a great time the rides were great also we enjoy all the different type of fish I would go again, lots of fun!!"
2008,11/7/2014,5,"Great shows and I really like that Sea World participates in the local youth marine biology camps. My daughter loved the interaction she had during camp. She was fascinated with learning about the marine life behind the shows, the natural behavior and environments that are required for them to thrive and Â survive."
2009,9/16/2010,4,"SeaWorld isn't the best of amusement parks, but it gets the job done.Plus the food served here is so good. I'd go back just to have a Roast Beef sandwich, or their turkey sandwich. Oh man it's so good.the only thing I am disappointed about is they took away their beer sampling bar. BOOO!!! but hey, they at least serve beer throughout the whole park.This place rocks."
2010,6/10/2013,5,Season passer...LOVE SEAWORLD!!!!! My kids love it! The pass was worth the money.
2011,8/10/2010,4,"I know it's not cool to say you like Seaworld and there are so many things I shouldn't like Â (I'm not really a fan of animal captivity) but is it the little kid in me? Â I don't go very often, but I always have a great time when I do.Bad stuff: Â The food. Â I haven't found anything I can eat there. Â The prices. Â The otherwise noted using animals for entertainment.But entertaining it is- and I really enjoy the shows and I feel 8 when I'm there (which I like) Â and in the summer there are fireworks.I haven't seen the new dolphin show but they are my favorites so now I have to go.Time to be mini-me."
2012,8/31/2009,4,"Maybe growing up here in San Diego has something to do with the fact that I just freakin love Sea World so much. Now that I've got a little one to bring, it's not quite as awesome as it used to be (being that I have to watch him) but it's still pretty cool.If you get the fun card, you basically pay for your 1 day admission of $65, then you get to go for the rest of the year for free. Â Well worth it if you're a so cal resident. Â Or, you can get the silver passport for $95 and it includes parking, which is like $10/car. Â If you have a family, just buy 1 silver passport, and buy fun cards for the rest (but you might have different expiration dates). Â Costco also has the silver passport for cheaper, so you can save even more. Â Plus, you can use your silver passport for food discounts.You can bring you own water into the park. Â The food is pretty bad, so eat before you go, or leave the park, have your hand stamped, drive to Phils BBQ on Sports Arena (or anywhere else on Sports Arena), then go back to the park. Â So worth it."
2013,1/3/2007,4,"When I first moved to SD way back when, I had a strong aversion to Sea World first because it was owned by a beer company whose beer isn't that great and second they keep large mammals in captivity. Really whales need much more space that what they give them. So in sight of their efforts to actually help sea animals and even rehabilitate damaged ones, I gave them a chance. I still have mixed emotions however when I finally went to the park when my daughter was a toddler I was actually impressed. It is kept in a very clean state. The grounds are nicely adorned with flowers and shrubbery. The Clydesdale horses are really cool and come out occasionally into a large ring for a better viewing. The shows are decent and humorous especially the Pets Rule show, a must for everyone. All the animals in the show are rescue pets adopted from shelters. Not too crazy about seeing Shamu, but the dolphin and sea otter show are fun. You will get wet if you sit in front.The best ride is the Shipwreck Rapids and you will not only get wet but soaked. Bring a change of clothes or don't go on it. It's a super water ride. The best time to go is in the Summer as they stay open late and shoot off fireworks nightly. The other great thing is the Cirque du la Mer show which you can only see in summer. This is put on by the same people who bring you all the Cirque shows. It's fabulous and would normally cost a bunch if seen elsewhere but here it's included in the admission price. They also have a fabulous night time show during the summer in front of the entrance. it's worth staying for. The other thing is that the admission price is fabulous compared to other theme parks for what you get. If you purchase one entrance ticket you can come back again any time during the rest of the year for free. You can't beat that anywhere. The best deal is a Platinum pass which you can pay monthly by the way. This will get you free premium parking and premium seating to all the shows plus one of your guests. There are other discounts as well on food and shopping. The sealife museums are also fabulous and they are interspersed throughout the park.I diggin' the word fabulous tonight in case you haven't noticed."
2014,8/16/2015,4,My family and I love SeaWorld. I'm a SeaWorld and Disneyland pass holder. Let's just say SeaWorld in my opinion is a lot better and convenient for us. We have room to walk the park with a stroller. Weren't not fighting crowds too much. Food and shopping was a reasonable price. We went on a Saturday and saw 3 shows and experienced many of the attractions in one day. We had lunch and dinner here and did great on our timing throughout the day. Invest in sun hats and sunscreen due to the limited shading while watching the shows. Can't wait to experience Halloween Here.
2015,7/7/2008,2,"Sea World is a beer ad, with normally wild animals doing shit they're rather not be doing.Seriously though, as an amusement park, I think it's quite a letdown.I'd rather take out of towners to the Zoo, or any of the museums in Balboa Park."
2016,5/31/2010,5,"Definitely my favorite tourist-y attraction in San Diego. Looking at all the sea-creatures is pretty rad. The shows are entertaining and theres always a bunch of seats. The Arctic Something was the best--emperor penguins, beluga whales and polar bears! How do you beat that?! Um, an interesting part though, was that the BF and I got a VERY close up Â view of two beluga whales doing the dirty. It was...interesting. It was like watching Discovery Channel + XXX whale porn. A lot of kids were scared that day, I'm sure.Anyways, back on track...I'd recommend the dolphin show ( I hear they have a new one) and of course the Shamu show. Oh! And I literally spent 30 minutes petting sting rays. Do that. DO IT.So yes, I'd come back here...if I had more money. Tickets can be fairly expensive (~55/person). They often have season-pass deals and So-Cal resident special pricing too, so check out their website. Also, I think if you buy online, you get a mini discount. Have fun!"
2017,8/13/2014,4,"Ignore the 1-star reviews here. Those are undoubtedly written by PETA drones or other morons who think ""Blackfish"" is a work of non-fiction. (In the real world, that film has been trashed by just about everyone with any knowledge of the situation. But facts don't matter to these people---they are on a crusade. The animals here lead incredibly pampered lives.)Yes, it is great to see marine mammals in the wild. I kayak a _lot_, and I've had humpback whales breach 20 yards from my kayak. Dolphins and/or sea lions are a near-constant presence when I'm on the water. But, the perspective you'll get here at Sea World is also quite spectacular.Now, to the park itself... We lived in San Diego for a short time in the year 2000, and visited Sea World several times back then. This was the first time I've been back since, nearly 14 years later. Here's what I see as the positives and negatives:Negatives:1) As many other reviewers point out, the park definitely needs some updating. Many of the facilities feel old and worn out, the new-age ""music"" might have seemed like a good idea 20 years ago, but it's just annoying now, etc. 2) The environmental message is a bit much, especially at the killer whale show. 3) The gift shops are relentless---after every ride, you have to pass thru another one. I pity the parents with young whiny kids...4) We bought the all-day food deal (about $30 and you can eat all you want, at selected locations). Unfortunately, you have to wait in line so long, that it's difficult to get 2 meals out of it.5) Lines for the rides were ridiculously long, and we were there on a weekday. The park sells some sort of expensive speed-pass. We didn't get that, because there are only a few rides that we wanted to do. But, I think I'd bite the bullet and pay the extra next time, since the regular lines were so long and so slow. I suspect they intentionally load the regular lines slowly, just to squeeze more money out for speed-passes.6) Did I mention, the lines are long?Positives:1) All of the shows we saw were very good to excellent, and those should be the main reason you come to this park. If it's a hot day, be brave and sit in the ""soak zone"". And don't miss the sea lion show, which pokes fun at all of the other shows. (You have to see that one after having seen several of the other shows or it won't make much sense.)2) The rides are actually pretty good, although there are not a lot of them. Of course, every one has a long, slow line, so do yourself a favor and buy the speed pass. Trust me."
2018,4/9/2013,4,This place is primarily for kids but I have to admit I did have a good time. Â It's not every day you get to pet a dolphin.
2019,4/20/2013,5,"Great place to take my 4 year old daughter, she had fun on our last visit. Well be back again!"
2020,9/20/2009,5,"It has been over 10 years since I've been to Seaworld, so it was like I was going here for the first time. Â Now that I've gotten older and have a family, it's interesting going to parks from a father standpoint.Went on a Friday, so it was not crowded, AND there was beautiful weather, great combo. Â Out of the four shows they had, we only watched the Shamu show (of course) and the Sesame 4-D show (for Kaley, of course).The Shamu show was fun, three killer whales flipping around and splashing all who sat within the first 10 rows. Â The music and dancing made me chuckle a little (do the sham slam by putting both hands up, then together, then slam it down) but overall it was amazing.My favorite exhibit was the Wild Artic (sorry penguins, I do love you too) where a huge polar bear walked right by us, literally separated by inches of glass.The best part of the trip was that I spent $5 on a carnival game and won a little elmo and a 4 ft tall big bird. Â My baby loves them both, let me tell you. Â  Oh, and the Bud Light Lime beer (served at a chilly 23 degrees F) was great too.The price was a little steep (12 for parking and 65 a ticket), but thanks to a special discount I get, my ticket was free, yay.If you haven't been to Seaworld, I would recommend going!"
2021,1/19/2012,1,"A big disappointment! We went 2 yrs ago and the shows were great. So we decided to get a annual silver pass. Big waste of money. Like other reviews that have said the shows are no longer fun to watch. The killer whales in the shammu show just swam around and did not do many tricks and the handlers don't get in the water with them anymore. And during the dolphin show we felt like we were just watching employees dressed up in bird costumes doing junior high level acrobatics. We just wanted to get up and leave. That is how we felt during all of the shows. Until they make changes in their shows, we won't be back."
2022,7/21/2008,4,"Yay! I'm a fan!What a great place to spend a day in southern California! The last time I was here, I was 3 so I didn't remember a thing.The day started off miserable because of the horrific traffic just to exit off the 5! This is a big reason why it's one star shy from a five. Absolutely horrendous. When you approach the kiosk to pay for parking, it's a absolute mess.Parking is $12.Other than that, the day was so fun! The only thing we regret is not planning out our day prior to going. The animals have certain feeding times, which are really fun to watch. We managed to go to all the animal exhibits when it was time to eat!The thing to do when you're at this place is the shows... they're all worth it even though you have to be there 30 minutes in advance to get a good seat. Shamu and the dslphins are awesome!The great thing about Seaworld is that there aren't any lines like Disneyland. The food is affordable. My husband and I shared a HUGE waffle cone jam packed and loaded with ice cream for just $4!! To me, it seems like inflation hasn't hit Seaworld yet. We also ate at the Picnic, which is an all you can eat buffet style eatery. They have salad, coleslaw, some cold veggies in italian sauce, bread, hot dogs, bbq chicken, sausages, baked beans, mashed potatos, and vanilla and chocolate cake. Includes coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and soda. Not bad for $15. When you go to the penguin encounter, make sure you stay for the whole presentation because they have a question of the day. If you're the first to answer correctly, you can go into the actual penguin exhibit and pet the penguins and learn more about them. I was jealous when I wasn't the one picked.Flamingos and penguins stink.But everything else was great! I had such a great day."
2023,10/4/2010,4,"We lucked out to be there during an overcast day and the crowds weren't overbearing. Â We were able to get through the park in 8 hours. Â As others have mentioned, the park is less about education and more about entertainment. Â However, as my friend aptly pointed out, while we would love liked more information, some people need the entertainment component to appreciate the animals and be introduced to conservation efforts.I actually think the all you can eat deal is great if you are planning to be there all day. Â Unlike other aquariums, you can feed the animals and they do incorporate interactive exhibits. Â They have an area where you can feed the bat rays and sea lions. Â As a result, the bat rays get close enough where you can actually touch them. Â They take their flamingos on walks and while most of the amusement park staff are teenagers, our experience was pleasant."
2024,6/10/2008,3,"This was an ok amusement park. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, rather than 'Sesame Place with sea life'. Got to see Shamu and some belugas, missed the dolphins, and had a surprisingly decent meal at Calypso Joe's Smokehouse. Enjoyed seeing the Clydesdales, which was very unexpected for something geared towards, you know, sea life.I found the map of the park to be terrible. Nothing was where the map lead me to believe it would be. The place was too geared towards children for me to get everything I had hoped for out of it, but if you've got kids, I imagine it's a wonderful place for them to get introduced to all of the life 'under the sea'. Plus some horses..."
2025,11/8/2012,5,"Sea World never gets old; loved it as a kid, still enjoy it as an Adult"
2026,7/22/2012,2,"Let me first say that my kids and my mother-in-law from Michigan had a good time. Â But my husband and I thought that the ""old"" Sea World, under Anheuser Busch, was alot better. Â We are Disneyland annual passholders. Â And, yes, we would all agree that Disney fun comes with a fairly hefty price tag. Â But we think that it is worth it. Â With this price comes some good food, clean facilities and good (if not great) entertainment. Â  A few things that we thought could improve:1) Bathrooms could be cleaner. Â At Disneyland, there is always somebody there to try to keep the bathrooms clean. Â Given the volume of people that come through both places, it is understandable that these bathrooms would get dirty but I won't say what I saw...2) Â Food/service could be better. Â We can't speak for all of the restauarants but the two that we went to that day were just not that good. Â I got this sandwich on focaccia bread and it was probably the worst sandwich I had had in a long time. Â I wish they had a Subway or Togo's on the premise! Â My husband's Caesar Salad was the kids' chicken tenders on a bed of soggy lettuce. Â Wow. Â It was not good. Â Also, they had run out of Sprite (huh?) and the lines for these restuarants during peak times were really, really long. Â My sister had two little kids and resorted to eating her granola bars from home. Â When I had ordered chicken, the lady offered one that he blood coming out. Â I had asked if I could please have the other one (pointing to one that didn't have that issue) to which she responded, ""Ma'am, they are all like that."" Â 3) Â Entertainment could be better. Â I feel bad writing this part because I have seen such great shows at Sea World in the past. Â But the ol' ""Clyde and Seymore Show"" was really not that good. Â Yes I realize that the sea animals were not in a participating mood (which I have never seen!). Â But that is beyond anyone's control and that is not what my review is about. Â It's about the terrible story line with this show. Â It was pretty boring. Â But the old dolphin show was even worse! Â We all remember the great fun we had watching these amazing dolphins do tricks jumping out of the water, etc. Â But this show was made up of a weird story line with acrobats and hardly any dolphins. Â I heard people behind me complain that they don't want the drama. Â They just want the dolphins! Â Pets Rule is always cute and we liked that one as the story line has remained unchanged. Â My son and my niece loved the Manta. Â But the wait got up to 1 hour. Â So be ready if you are planning on going on this ride. Â  This was probably the highlight for the 3 of us who went on that ride. Â Outside of that, the trip was pretty uneventful for the adults who went."
2027,2/15/2010,4,"Seaworld is a good place to go on a warm day. We decided to come here instead of Disneyland because it was a block out day for our year passes. We came here around 130pm. We decided to go to the shamu show first. We first went over to the bakery and got a muffin and cookie. We headed over to the show but it was early because it started at 230pm. We decided to go to see the aquarium exhibit. After the exhibit, we decided to go to the shamu show. It was open to get seated now. I know we were able to get some good seats. We sat in the soak row. I think we were in row 14. Luckily we didn't get soaked like some others did. The show was awesome. It is a lot different than how I remember it. It has been a while since I saw it last. After the shamu show, we decided to go to shipwreck rapids for the ride. Little did we know how wet we were going to get. My gf got soaked. Even after 3 hours her pants were still soaked. I wished we got there earlier to ride the ride. After the ride, we decided to have a late lunch and go to the Calypso Bay Smokehouse. We decided to get the Smokehouse sampler along with an extra side of fries. It was good we brought water to drink so we didn't have to buy anything. I also got a beer along with the dinner. The food was ok I thought. It didn't seem so good to me. After lunch/dinner we went over to the penguin encounter since the gf loved them. After the exhibit, I decided to get her a little gift. We then walked over to the carnival game area and we played a game to win a prize. We won and got a stuffed animal. We took some photos and then went home. Sea world was a fun time. Only if we had time to do more."
2028,9/9/2010,3,"SeaWorld is a great place to go... About $60 for the day plus $12 for parking lets you in to a variety of shows, a couple rides, and a few cool animal viewings (or touchings in the case of the bat rays, which is my favorite). Yes, it sounds expensive, but when you consider the amount of time you are filling (e.g., an entire day), it's not so bad. Just save a few extra bucks and bring in your own snacks; yes, it's allowed. What I'm a bit more reluctant to review is the dolphin interaction. One person on this site wrote that she thought it was amazing and stayed with the dolphins for more than 30 minutes. My recent experience was much different. I don't know the price, as it was a birthday gift (though he said it was very expensive, so I presume $300 as a guess), but I was in a group of six and in the pool with two dolphins (one per group, as there was another group) for about 20 minutes. First, we sat on a ledge in the deep end and made signs to our dolphin (Ripley) so he would do tricks, such as making a farting noise, splashing us, turning in circles (""dancing"") and so on. At one point, we got to pat him on the head and rub his chin; he felt like a wet cell phone case (hard plastic with a slightly rubbery outside). In the shallow end for the next 10 minutes, we did more tricks and took turns posing for a photo holding the dolphin's head and giving it a kiss. This was more a photo op for SW, so they can have at least one great photo with which to convince you to buy their photo package--instead, you may wish to get in good with your group and have one person buy the $100 full package and then split the cost (but this novel idea hit me much too late). In any case, SW itself is a fun venue and the dolphin interaction was cool, but beware! You don't spend a long time in the pool, and the interaction is mostly limited to making hand signals at a dolphin while only touching it twice--and no, you do NOT swim with the dolphins, even though SW in Orlando supposedly offers this option. You do, however, get a free towel of hotel quality; I guess that's worth the cost [sarcasm]. Though my negatively pervades, note that most of the others in my group who are not obsessed with value had a fantabulous time."
2029,4/2/2011,4,"Fun place to hang out. It's by the bay so you get to inhale the nice sea breeze rolling into beautiful San Diego. The shows I must say have gotten worst over the years. There's not as many tricks and I was disappointed that the dolphin show turned into more of a human acrobat show. My favorite show there has got to be the sea lion show. It's hilarious! Aside from that though, the exhibits are great and you can even feed some of the animals. Watch out for those pesky seagulls though, they can snatch the $1 feeding fish out of your hand. One of the bigger highlights is the food at Sea World. It is surprisingly good for a theme park. The food is a bit pricey though but I guess if you're gonna pay $10 for a theme park meal, they make it fairly worth it.If you're ever in San Diego, this place is a must see. It takes aquariums to the next level."
2030,12/21/2011,2,"I'm not big on mystifying water. Could care less about oceans or seas. And the world that inhabits them, I could take it or leave it. Which makes it absurd that I live in an aquacentric town like San Diego. Beach themed anything feels dumbed down and stultifying. We evolved from the water. Why do I need to go back into it? Yes, I need to know how to swim if I somehow get submersed. And we need unpolluted water for drinking. And contrary to Kurt Cobain's lyric, I do believe fish might have some feelings, at the very least feel pain. But other than that, I find water worship pointless.Which leads me to Sea World. I have a free pass (mind-controllingly named a ""fun pass"") and it still feels like a waste of time. I can't imagine paying $75 apiece to see fish swimming around in aquariums. As much as the park tries to make you suspend your disbelief with snack bars in the shape of barges and winky marine puns (""Pardon the waves we're making, but this ride is sure to be a splash in 2012), you can never completely give in to the experience. Ultimately, you're just on a highly sanitized plot of land by the bay.Most of the fish being forced into captivity really doesn't bother me. They're just mindless fish. But the whales? Come on. The boxes they're confined in are the size of a suburban pool. To make matters uncomfortably worse, they must perform sub-canine tricks to get their food ration. And disturbingly, all the ""trainers"" are bleach-blonde cheerleader types with forced rictus smiles that act like the whales are their best friends. No, they're not your cute cuddly pals. They hate you. They want to kill you. But you have power over them. You control their food supply. That's it. If they were where they were supposed to be, they wouldn't need you. Whales fend for themselves rather nicely. So don't act like you're doing the whales any favors by petting them. It's condescending and off-putting. And as an amusement park, stop selling the idea that you're doing something environmentally worthy by caging these beasts. Worst of which is the apocalyptic penguin exhibit with its surreal quantity of flightless birds looking so out of place and disoriented thousands of miles from their natural habitat. All you're doing is creating an artificial marine prison so you can scam suckers for $75 a pop, not counting your crap food and souvenirs. But I guess when you vacation in mind-rotting San Diego, you soon are willing to buy into anything.The kids do like the rides, which the park had to add to keep the little ones from falling asleep at the site of this piscatory circle jerk. My daughter loves the Elmo ride. I just have to make sure I have to circumnavigate around the cross-marketing Sesame Street shmatte stand. So, as local amusement parks go, far worse than the zoo but better than the infuriatingly dull Legoland."
2031,8/29/2011,4,"I use to love this place as a kid but that's what this park is catered to, kids. Â Once you realize it, you'll notice that there isn't much to do as an adult, but I do understand that if I ever have kids, this place would blow their minds away.Sure the price is pretty steep, but hey there are ways of getting around it with deals and just being aware of the value of a dollar. I still come by occasionally, and It's refreshing to see that they add new attractions."
2032,4/17/2006,2,why the low rating?....well...have you noticed that they always have the SAME ol' routine...they might have a new attraction once every decade or something..but since i been a kid to this day....they never change up the routines.....
 worth a trip if it's your kid's first time...but that's about it....,,,
2033,5/5/2013,5,Great for kids and adults. I have a fun card and go all the time
2034,10/20/2006,4,"Let me start off by saying that I have a bit of a fetish. Â It has to deal with leather and ropes and stuff, but I guess that doesn't really have anything to do with Seaworld.Anyway, I love dolphins and the fishes in just the same way. Â Seaworld is one of the best places to see these awesome animals in action. Â Oh, you can go to an aquarium and see some fish and even fish that are of the jelly nature, any time you want. Â But when do you get to see dolphins and an enormous black and white whale flying through the air? Â And what could be more entertaining than watching people being ""surprised"" that they are sitting in the ""splash zone"" and actually getting wet?! Â Great stuff.Oh jeeze, I hope I didn't just ruin something for someone.To make up for that I'm going to give you newbies some tips on making the most out of seeing the swimming and flying folk at seaworld:Bring some food in and you'll be stoked that you managed to save 20 bucks and you have a better lunch than what they serve (although the smoothies are pretty good even for the price). Â There are tons of sweet places to eat your packed lunch.Get a schedule of the shows ahead of time so that you don't miss them. Â The Shamu show doesn't go as often as you think.A bit on the pricey side, but I like to think of it as feeding all of the animals."
2035,9/5/2008,4,"If they can teach a couple thousand pound whale to swim to the platform on the other side and spin around on top using just hand gestures and small whistle, I should be able to teach my kitten to talk. Â After getting a kitten and seeing how much more well trained these wild animals are, it motivates me and depresses me at the same time. Â This year was my first time going to the night shows for Shamu and the dolphins and I must say the night shows are SO much better! Â They have way better music at night and it almost seems as if there is less direction from the people to the animals during the show. Â If I were contemplating whether to come to Seaworld I'd most definitely come during their summer nights because the shows are worth bearing the crowds. Â Also it seemed as if they changed their day shows and they seemed less impressive two years ago when I went. Â Either way, these are some well trained animals."
2036,4/18/2009,3,"SeaWorld is one of those places where out of state people expect you to go to everyday, but in reality I think I have been there literally less than five times in all my life living in San Diego. I can recall four times that I remember. Perhaps its because the prices are so damn expensive, but luckily this last trip in, I got myself in for about six bucks thanks to teaching preschoolers and taking them on a field trip there.The idea of taking any child to a place as big as SeaWorld is terrifying let alone taking 23 of them.... The park is really too far spread out to really see anything under a time crunch and is hell on little legs or the adults that end up carrying them. The signs might as well be in another language because the arrows sure definitely don't depict the proper direction of any attraction. We spent more time lost even with maps and four adults than ever. Useless.But my favorite part and the reason why I can't knock any more stars off of is because their polar bear, shark, and penguin exhibits are my all time favorites. The long tubes with sharks swimming above your heads, long tubes to go through with more penguins than you have seen in Happy Feet, and of course my favorite animals, polar bears. Being so close to them is a treat polar freaks like myself drool over. And a word of caution: watch yourselves and your children in the shark encounter. The lighting is poor and there are many unexpected elevation changes in the floor...."
2037,6/18/2013,3,"Not the same as when I was an eight-year-old on vacation. Very crowded, even first thing in the morning. Very little shade."
2038,5/8/2007,4,"I love Sea World especially in the Summer time, once a year is enough for me though (it gets kinda crowed and there isnt that much to do after you have visited once) and I do think that its pricey, now its aprox. $57, and Disneyland being $53, then give me Disney any time.But I have to say that it is a must if you are visiting San Diego, you will have a great time believe me, visit and make an opinion for yourselves. Have a great time!"
2039,3/11/2014,5,"SeaWorld has the best, most interesting shows. I bought a year long pass and go periodically hoping that I see something get eaten by a killer whale, or at least a flesh wound. A plum of blood would look so pretty in that pale blue reverse osmosis filtrated tank against that opal stage. Let's hope one of those whales has a crossed signal!"
2040,7/9/2010,5,"This place was the shit when I was growing up and it still is! Its open from 9am Â to 11pm during the summer, it costs about $69 for an all day trip but its totally just worth it to get year round passes. There are so many shows to see and amusement rides to enjoy that you will not be able to try everything in one day. There are also opportunities to dine with Shamu, jump in the water with dolphins, serve as an animal trainer for the day, and take a behind the scenes tour.And for those who are 21 and over there is a beer garden mmmm best part the kids can play in the grass hills and the parents can enjoy a nice taste of beer. At least that's what my dad did with us kids lol!!!"
2041,4/20/2010,3,"i have a very faint and vague memory of sea world given that the last time i was there i was 3. having gone this past weekend (w/bf and bf's friends) Â i can refresh my memory and securely say that the zoo is better!the shows were few and far between and while the shamu show was awesome, it didn't make up for the lack of other show options. Â park layout is rather odd and makes for getting from show to show rather difficult. as can be expected show plots/lines are cheesy although still fun to watch if you block out the cheese-factor. Â the artic animals housing was interesting and enjoyable.overall for the price you pay to get into the park, i felt the options to see and be entertained were rather slight. Â  still, if you have a bunch of days to visit SD and about $60+ for entrance fee (not including parking & food), then throw sea world on the list...afterall, it's still a great place to touch a dolphin, pet a sting-ray, do the shamu wave, and enjoy some aquatic life (and one-day pass = an all YEAR pass, so there IS that...)....otherwise, skip and hit up the zoo!*note: active military get in free (once a year) and company of the military are at a 20% discount!"
2042,8/10/2010,5,"It's a great place for a mini vacation! We just took the kids here a few weeks ago and what a fun time it was! There is nothing better than seeing your child light up with excitement when they see Shamu come out of the water, priceless! Â  My favorites are the dolphins, but we loved all the shows. Â My daughter fell as she was excited to get to the next event so we had to make a stop in the park emergency center. Nothing serious just a few Band-Aids and we were on our way. Â At the end of the day we were walking to the car my son said that it was the best day ever and it truly was."
2043,1/26/2011,5,"The price of admission with a AAA discount was $61.99 and kids 3 and under are free. We took our two kids, 2 and 8 months, and they both loved it. We were there for 6.5 hours and still didn't see everything. We saw Shamu, the otters/sea lion show, and rode nearly every ride.The only bad part was the damn seagull who swooped down and stole a chicken tender right off my son's plate.Oh, and for the price of admission, you might as well get a yearly pass if you live within driving distance. If you go more than once, it pays for itself."
2044,11/28/2011,1,"Sea World was sad. Â The huge, beautiful ""wild"" animals in small, unnatural environments was disturbing. The ones with ""jobs"" performing at least have a trainer and something to do, but caged animals are pointless and it's inhumane. The Polar Bears seemed depressed and the Walrus was living all by himself in a tank too small. Â We are having a hard time forgetting about those animals. Another troublesome issue was how few bathrooms there were for so many people...always a long line with all those kids needing to get right in. And then on exiting, all how many thousands of us leaving through one gate...that seemed downright dangerous and not just annoying . We loved seeing those amazing, majestic sea creatures up close but overall it's just sad."
2045,7/14/2008,3,"The Seaworld in Florida is much better. If you haven't been, this one is good too. My only complaint is they don't allow strollers inside any of the shows so you have to load and unload the kids every time you want to walk through an exhibit . The hassle of unloading the kids just to walk through a 10 minute exhibit...then load them back in. Plus, I felt very uneasy leaving the Bugaboo($800) in the stroller area because anyone could walk away with it. Next time I am bringing a cheapie $15 umbrella stroller. I felt bad for the mothers with several small children. I saw many parents struggling when one child fell asleep. It prevented the rest of the family from doing anything. Also several restaurant areas had steps everywhere. I was very difficult to maneuver around eating areas to find available seating. I figure with so many parents with strollers that they would have a better lay out.My kids did enjoy the water areas. It was a great way to keep cool in the hot summer sun. They also enjoyed the whales. If you plan on eating with Shamu or the under water dinner, make reservations when you get there, do not wait until you are hungry. Meal times fill up quickly. I am giving bonus points for FREE entry for Military families once a year!"
2046,4/5/2012,2,The last time I was here I was 12. Now maybe it was actually better back then or maybe I was easier to please at that age. This place is ghetto. Only 3/4 of the bathrooms are in working order and only 1/4 of those do not have piss all over the floors. They have such a bad set up for the way they serve food that the lines to eat are longer than lines for the shows and the rides. An hour and 20 minutes to get lunch WTH. They do have some cool shows and rides and I will review those individually but as a whole boo on you seaworld.
2047,12/3/2007,3,"Got a free ticket from a friend and did the Sea World day trip thing. Â It was nice in the off-season because it wasn't that crowded. Â The parts I didn't enjoy: Tons of seagulls and pigeons everywhere. Â One pooped on me during Shamo....bastard! Â Can't help but feel sorry for the locked up killer whales. Â The free beer yes free beer is given in these insanely small cups....oh and you can only get Busch brand beer.Pros: The dolphins are exciting. Â There's a PETS show that was amazing because they actually taught cats tricks...I didn't even know that was possible. Â Free beer even if it was small cups. Â There is a beer tasting sign up to sample all of A. Busches beers its interesting but not mind blowing. Â The virtual Polar Ice ride rocks! Overall, more fun than I thought it would be."
2048,6/16/2008,4,"Really don't like amusement parks in general. Â The idea of people people people everywhere, expensive concession stands, souvenir traps everywhere, etc, gives me a sense of panic.After persistent pleadings by my kids, we planned a trip, along with Dinner with Shamu. Â It was actually fun. Â The Shamu show was fantastic. Â So was the dolphin show. Â But after a while, I started resenting the fact that these magnificent amazing animals were being demeaned into doing cheap tricks to amuse the masses. Â The trainers were super hyper, dancing around, etc. Â My kids, however, loved all of it. Â Dinner with Shamu gave us a chance to sit down and eat, with a good view of the killer whales. Â The tickets are Very expensive. Â $49 pp through AAA. Â The dinner was another $100 for the four of us. Â However we stayed all day and enjoyed it."
2049,8/7/2009,4,"OMG, the samu show sucked. Samu rocks??? omfg it was like 15 minutes of dancing about 7 minutes of that was some REALLY REALLY GAY SALSA dancing with no whales @ ALL, 2 minutes of a some misfit trying to play guitar. With to sluts dancing around him.It was crap.we saw the wales maybe 5 minutes top through the entire thingthey didnt educate the crowd @ all. they didnt well do anything besides dance, it was a major disappointment.My gals boy was sooooo bored.The guy selling the lights tried to steal money from us by giving bad change 3 times over. He tried to argue with my girl, freaking thief. He fessed up ""oh my bad"" after minute of arguing, and a large crowd was forming.It was just a major disappointment...its nothing like it used to be....O and I don't like the finger print system, how is that faster than having photo id's??all in all its sad used to love this place, now its selling out."
2050,2/15/2010,4,"Seaworld isn't just for kids anymore! Â Well, it's mostly for kids, but it was actually pretty fun to go back since the last time I went about 5 years ago. Â If you love animals it's great to go and watch them play and be cute. Â My favorite was the otters and the belugas were pretty cool too. Â The dolphin show is not open for revamping and will reopen May2010. Â The other shows were fun but definitely geared towards the ""younger family fun"" sort of audience.Warning: Â you can get really wet on the Journey to Atlantis ride even though it doesn't look that bad."
2051,8/24/2012,4,"The longest line at Sea World, Â but totally worth it! Waaaaay better that Grizzly River Run at California Adventure ....YEAH, I said it. I wouldn't if it weren't true"
2052,7/8/2009,3,"Since I've in San Diego all my life, I can pretty much walk around this damn park with my eyes closed and know the shows so well, that I can tell if theres a goof or if an animal doesnt want to perform. The shows are ok, the only one worth watching is the sealions (night and day show) because Its actually funny. They seem to change the plot often, but the tricks and the story line are still the same ( not sure if that makes since). I also love the pets rule show, its amazing to see all the pets do tricks like that. Shamu show is kinda werid now, the rotating screens and the trainer running out with and ore like that monkey in the lion king is strange. I do like how they ask all the people in the service to stand up to honor them, that always brings tears to my eyes and gives me the chills. The only show I refuse to go to is the dolphins. The plot is always the same (the family member who falls in the water is actually a trainer, omg!!!)The rides are cool, i wish there were more. Journey to atlantis is fun, dont sit in the front cause you get soaked (happend to me last summer, i looked like i fell in the water and my cell phone got damaged. Shipwreck rapids is freaking awsome!!! The water fall doesnt turn off that great on the right side, so its going at full blast and I aways get soaked. They have these things were you can pay 25 cents and blast people in the ride, happens way too many times, ive tried hunting down the people to kick their ass for shooting me in the head.food is kinda pricey, you should bring your own, but they have a large selection of places to eat at. And if your a passholder, you get a discount!speaking of passholder, I think if you live in seaworld and go at least 3 times a year, you should buy the pass. Free parking, dscounts, its worth it. But just dont go on the 4th of july like I did, too many tourist and screaming kids,"
2053,1/4/2008,3,"I hadn't been to Sea World in years and expected to really hate it. Especially compared to our fabulous San Diego Zoo. Unlike the zoo, Sea World has the Anheiser Busch tie-ins and a gift shop around every corner. (Five dollars for a latte? Give me a break!)But we got our fun passes (a year's entry for the price of one day) and the place kind of grew on me.Boo for:* The hokey Shamu ""Believe"" show. Makes me want to retch.* The lack of educational materials. The average guest learns very little about any of the marine life.* Lines for the rides that are too long.* $10 to park in the lot.Hooray for:* The summer-only Clyde and Seymor show that spoofs all the other shows. Very funny!* The brisket meal at the BBQ joint. A little pricey, but it's good to find a balanced meal that doesn't leave you feeling like a wreck at any theme park.* The exhibits we only discovered our second and third trips to the park, like the aquarium near Cirque du Mer with the giant sea turtles, the moray eel exhibit and the manatees. I also love the penguin exhibit and watching the beluga whales. In the winter, you almost have the place to yourself and once they even gave us free fish to feed the sea lions.* The Christmas tree lot with fake snow blowing (seasonal and effing weird! But it made me smile.)"
2054,3/16/2011,3,Pros: - New attractions every time you visit.- Attractive to all age group.Cons:- Might get bored if you spend a whole day.
2055,1/10/2013,4,"I have loved Sea World for most of my life, I have for the past 20years plus maintained their platinum annual pass, the shows have become much less fun to watch the past few years, the people doing the show flying through the air in the arena with birds and a short show with sealife sucks. The other show that is less fun to watch is the Shamu show, I know that the people can no longer swim with the whales for safety, this is why they get 4 stars instead of 5,the rest of Sea World is still great"
2056,8/9/2010,5,"First of all, I went with 3 friends, all in our twenties. Â I really didn't think I was going to enjoy the experience as much as I did! Â I liked the fact that the whole park basically revolved around shows, which didn't involve standing in line as much as Disneyland did. Â If you can, I'd recommend getting the Platinum Pass, which basically meant you can get optimal seating at any show as long as you show up 10 minutes ahead of time. I really liked the more ""skit-based"" shows like Sea Lions Live and the Cirque de la Mer. Blue Horizons was too overproduced and didn't have enough dolphins, which is odd for a show about, um, dolphins. Â It was only towards the end that I realized there were more than 4 dolphins? Â Shamu was a little too kitschy for my taste, starting with the video and ending with the ""Shamu Shamu"" gestures. Â But all in all, I could see how kids would enjoy all that. Food is not spectacular, but there was way more variety than Disneyland or the like. Â The smoothies at Pineapple Pete's was actually pretty good! Â It was very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon."
2057,5/29/2007,3,"Hmmm, from reading the other reviews, it appears that the consensus of Seaworld, is that it's just average. Unfortunately, as much as I'd really like to disagree with the popular opinion, I can't.Back in the day, when I was a wee little sprout, Marine World was in Redwood Shores, and was off the hook. The animals did really cool, amazing tricks ... Killer Whales & dolphins doing multiple somersaults, finding and fetching hoops, and doing other tricks while blindfolded! Ahh, gone are those days. The animal tricks at Seaworld were pretty lame, and I admit that I was sadly disappointed, not only for me but also for my daughter, who was expecting to be dazzled. We enjoyed ourselves, and thought the shows were ""OK"" (and I do mean just, OK), but I wasn't thrilled, especially after having to push through the throngs of people to find a decent seat, sit and wait for 30 minutes. Shamu was pretty lame, as all he did was swim around and splash the audience. For what I paid to get into the park, $50 per person + parking, I would have done that!However, I must admit that Wild Arctic & the Shark Encounter were pretty cool. My advice is to check it out if you can find seriously discounted tickets, and not to go on a holiday weekend, the crowds will be brutal!"
2058,8/12/2012,4,Seaworld has gotten better I think over the years. Â I like how they don't charge for the sky rides anymore and they give people a chance to pet the dolphins now.
2059,8/25/2007,4,"I've lived in San Diego for most of my life and I've only been to SeaWorld a few times. Â Why is that? Â Any way... I went to SeaWorld with my parents and visiting cousin yesterday. Â Before I left, I looked for coupons online. Â I'm glad I did! Â If you print your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards card and take it to the ticket counter, you can get 20% off your entire party's tickets. Â Great deal!The animals never disappoint. Â Don't miss:1) The walruses in the Wild Arctic - you can get really close, which is really cool2) Feeding the dolphins3) The Shamu Show... it seemed like they had fewer tricks - maybe because of the recent accidents4) Manatee Rescue - they are just so cute5) Touching the bat rays6) Shark EncounterI didn't go this time, but Clyde and Seamore's Risky Rescue is always a fun show.I was a bit disappointed by the Penguin Encounter. Â They supposedly renovated it so I was expecting it to be great. Â Same as ever expect they now push you through on a conveyer belt.One last thing, bring your own food. Â The food was expensive and very disappointing. Â Measly portions and not very tasty."
2060,7/8/2013,4,"I love this place. Where else can you interact with dolphins and manta rays and see countless other marine animals? Either way, this place is great. Spend a night here and go to the San Diego Zoo after. Highly Recommended."
2061,9/16/2009,3,"YAY to all the animals, BOO to all the attractions and exhibits that were closed for the day/season!My family and I were so excited to see the dolphins. And see the killer whales. But guess what? We couldn't... because they closed it down. Oh, and we were so excited to take our 1.5 year old daughter to see a Sesame Street show. But guess what? We couldn't do that either because they canceled it last minute due to technical difficulties. Prices EVERYWHERE, from food to souvenirs, were overpriced but what do you expect at an amusement park?Another thing I HATED was their customer service at the ticket counter. They tried to rip me off, telling me that it was $65/ticket. I told the smug cashier that I went online and saw that we could get a 2-day pass for $55. She said ""Yes but the price for the 1-day pass is $65""......... I replied with, ""Fine, I'll take the 2-day passes"". Okay, maybe she wasn't smug, maybe she was just DUMB!The shows and exhibits that WERE open, we DID go to. They were fun and very entertaining."
2062,12/14/2010,3,"Okay Sea World, I loved the Shamu Show and the other exhibits and your park is great....but please do something about your Crappy food! Â If Im going to have to pay like im dining at some 4 star restaurant then at least make it taste good. Â After that experience my husband and I swore never to dine at theme parks again! Other than that this place is great for the family!"
2063,12/4/2009,5,"I am actually making sad panda face at the fact that I cannot give Sea World more stars. Â So I thought I was going to be really annoyed with Sea World since the last time I went I was a tendergoth, and of course that is the most angsty stage as you can probably tell from the name. Â Also, I don't hide the fact that I really don't understand or tolerate most (all) children. Â I also obviously am a creature of the night and hate sunlight, so I bet you're wondering how five stars came to be.. ^v^My two nine year old twin little sisters were here visiting. Â I went with one on Saturday, and the other on Sunday.First thing we did day 1 was walk in and threw away the map to make it an adventure. Â I saw the pet show, ninja dog, clumsy pig and tight-rope cat! Â Atlantis dolphins, manatee rescue, seal feeding, the bayside sky ride, wild arctic beluga whales, penguin encounter.. it's all outstanding. Â If you know what's good for you stop by Pineapple Petes and get the brownie a-la-mode funnel cake @_@"
2064,12/7/2010,5,"SeaWorld is one of those places as a child you fall in love with and later as a teenager and adult get the opportunity to hopefully revisit. Â It's a trip down memory lane and the ability to re-experience parts of our childhood that keep us young.My visit to SeaWorld was fantastic! The park was accessible, realistically well priced in most areas, and very well laid out. Â I thoroughly enjoyed the Samu show, the otters, shark exhibit, and the overall experience. Â I can't wait to get the opportunity to revisit SeaWorld."
2065,8/4/2012,2,"I'm not sure if growing up made this place ""ok"" to me, or there's something wrong going on. The show's have changed a lot. Most of the shows here aren't even worth viewing. The Shamu show seem's pretty boring now and most of the show is focused on the monitors. The food was alright, but REALLY overpriced. I still loved seeing all the different aquariums but they need to do something with Shark Reef. They allow like hundreds of people in at once and you'll barely be able to move, let alone view the sharks until you reach the tunnel (which feels like 120 degrees inside.) That aside, I feel like the rides and the aquariums are the only factor that make me want to come back here. People are right about how there's hardly any shade anywhere. What irk'ed me was how unorganized this park was. Getting on rides and attractions was a constant shove fest."
2066,5/31/2010,3,"I went on busy busy Memorial Day weekend and I MISSED THE NEW DOLPHIN SHOW-BLUE HORIZONS. Â On busy days, they limit the amount of attendees to the dolphin show and you are supposed to go there early in the day and pick up a wrist band for the show.. it's first-come-first-serve.I can't believe I paid $50 and missed the dang dolphin show.. I had to watch it from outside the gates with the other 100+ people who missed out as well. JUST LET US IN!I'm sad because I also missed the pet show.. The schedule said 6:30pm and I got there at 6:29pm and they wouldn't let me in. Â OMG there are empty seats inside. JUST LET US IN!I thought this place used to be fun but it's gotten sort of lame. Â You pay so much money for the ticket alone and the trainers don't even ride on Shamu anymore. Â The Shamu show STINKS now.. they sing a song for 30 minutes talking about reaching your dreams.. and I'm thinking.. well if you reached your dreams show me what you got instead of just throwing your arms around telling the whale to do some tricks!!If you need to think about your budget, make sure you factor in all the other costs the park robs you of..i.e.*parking fee*drinks/food*extra fee to ride the tower*All you can drink bottle-$8, or $11 if you have a kid that wants the shamu glued to the top of the bottle.*extra fees for souvenirs if you have kids who are begging you to buy the shamu doll that costs $$$$$*remember the SHAMU song I was talking about earlier? Â The trainer is wearing a necklace and then after the show they try to sell the necklaces to your kids."
2067,8/6/2012,3,"Fun place to take the family, the shows are not as good as they use to be. Food is pretty pricey, but that's at any place like this."
2068,2/18/2012,3,I am unsure of why this place is so popular because honestly there isn't anything great about it. The shows suck in my opinion and I hate the whale show now. I like all different water animals being there but that's about it.
2069,10/23/2009,3,"Seaworld: It is what it is. I'm not going to say that it wasn't fun because it definitely was entertaining and educational; however, as the day went on I Â just got more hungry for sushi. Is that bad?"
2070,5/8/2013,3,"We greatly appreciated the complimentary passes for military and families but I'm sorry to say had we paid I would have been disappointed. There wasn't much to see that you can't see everywhere else besides the whales and they made you leave your strollers unsecured and unattended to go see pretty much everything in the park. We were unable to take our child through the wild arctic because children must be 42"" to take the ride that was the only access to view the polar bear, walrus, and beluga whale to the best of my knowledge. Every exhibit has a gift center to walk through at the end making the experience with a 3 year old more difficult. Overall it was ok but glad it was free."
2071,4/16/2006,4,"The marine mammals at Sea World do tricks and interact with their trainers in a way that makes them appear to be touchingly pleased by the applause and adoration of the crowd. Â But are Shamu (I was surprised to learn that this moniker refers, not to an individual whale, but to a trademark, and is used in reference to a number of different animals) and his friends really happy? Â Do their toothy smiles and wagging tails belie a deep despair? Â I guess I don't really want to know the answer to this. Â I prefer to think of the animals in captivity at Sea World as fellow urbanites; creatures, like myself, who exist in cramped living quarters and have a more stressful than average lifestyle, but are nevertheless content with the amount of mental stimulation that they receive on a daily basis. Â Of course, in Shamu's case, a greater amount of free will has been taken away than in my own. Â Sigh."
2072,5/4/2013,5,"Great park, easily filling a day with fun shows, rides and exhibits. The Wild Arctic ride was a bit dated, but apart from that it was well worth the $78 ticket!"
2073,8/7/2010,5,"Just read Felicia's review, which was fairly accurate. Â As with everything in this world, things are different from other people's point of view.My family of 5 just finished our day at Sea World. Â It was great. Â I had ordered the tickets online before we went (got 2 of the kids' tickets for free with an online promo), reserved parking (which I upgraded to the ""preferred"" parking for an extra $5 when we got here - parked in the 2nd row), reserved a double stroller online, and also ordered the all-day meal tickets.Knowing the day was paid for before arriving allows you to enjoy the day more without worrying about the price of meals, water, etc. Â I highly recommend getting that all sorted before you arrive.The meal deal was worth it for us because we ate breakfast there. Â Would have been about the same price if we paid from our pocket otherwise (probably a little more than the meal passes). Â The passes only allow you into the restaurants, though - you can't grab a frozen ice, churro, or drink from any of the little stands, which was fine with me.The shows were pretty good. Â I think we saw all of them (sea lions, pets, Blue Horizons, Shamu, Cirque de la mer). Â The sea lion show hasn't changed much from when I was a kid (same stunts, different ""show""). Â Kids really enjoyed it, though. Â Same with the pets. Â Some of the stuff the pets did was really cool to watch - I couldn't believe a couple of the tricks I saw. Â The Cirque de la mer was good, too. Â We all enjoyed it - went in without knowing anything about it.Blue Horizons & Shamu Rocks were great. Â  I love seeing large marine animals doing the jumps - always have.Enjoyed Journey to Atlantis ride, too. Â My 4-year old even went on it & loved it.The Wild Arctic ""Moving Experience"" is NOT TO BE MISSED! Â That was really cool, and only like a 10 minute wait. Â I would have loved to have gone on it again. Â Really, really neat.Food was decent for an amusement park, and decent price, too. Â Went to Disneyland a few days ago.... this was much more reasonable for what you got.Also a much more manageable crowd than Disneyland, which makes it more enjoyable. Â We were able to see all the shows and hit most of the attractions, even eating 3 meals and taking a lot of bathroom breaks (remember the 4-year old?).I feel everything has to do with expectations - and your mood. Â We lucked out and beat the rush for a number of things, which really was nice. Â I went into the Blue Horizons & Cirque de la mer without any expectations and enjoyed them both. Â Again, food wasn't super, but wasn't bad, either. Â Even if you didn't do the food package, it was cheaper (and better) than Disneyland. Â Kids meals were $7.50 or so, but they were a decent portion and they came on a plastic Shamu plate you can keep. Â  Â Having the day paid for before arriving was VERY nice. Â Helps you budget your trip better. Â Wish more places (DISNEY) would do that.Perfect experience? Â No (is there one?). Â But all 5 of us really liked it, took away some good memories, and a few souvenirs (ok, so the entire trip WASN'T paid for in advance!)."
2074,4/24/2011,3,"Not the best sea world by anymeans, sorry the Orlando park has all the others beat.But still a great way to spend the afternoon."
2075,8/27/2014,5,"loved it, seaworld actually has rides now, alot different from when i was a kid"
2076,7/18/2008,5,Im giving it a five because I'm from San Diego and I have to.If you're local the smart thing to do is buy the fun card which allows you to pay for one admission at regular price and return for the rest of the year for free. It's fun during the summer they have extended hours with live entertainment and fireworks. We actually went Last night we arrived at seven watched the shamu show rode a few rides looked at a few animals watched fireworks and left! advice bring your own food and beverages. the food there is expensive and grossbring a towel and a change of clothes you're almost certain to get wet at some point.
2077,7/31/2014,3,"Getting a map when first walking in is helpful because it lists all the times for shows. Some of the main attractions were closed for ""maintenance"" which was a bummer. Dolphin show & sea lion show were the best."
2078,6/30/2012,5,"Not really sure how anyone could give sea world bad reviews. Sea world is amazing. We have silver season passes and live very close by so we go to Sea World all the time. For us, we can avoid all the traffic (go late at night or randomly in the middle of the day). We don't have to pay for parking since we have a Silver pass. And the animals at Sea World are amazing! We don't go for the shows, we go to hang out with the dolphins, whales, polar bears, sharks, penguins, and Obi the disgustingly gigantic walrus with cataracts. We love being able to pet the dolphins and hang out with them! When I go, I really feel like the animals are mine and sea world just kind of holds onto them for me. :) Â I also like that Manta opened recently and isn't just some lame kiddy ride. It's actually got some good twists and turns and the beginning is awesome. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
2079,9/8/2012,4,"To all you reviewers who wrote that SeaWorld has been somehow ruined since your youth: you are an adult now, so of course it aint gonna be the same. Especially since you got that fun-ectomy in the ensuing years. OK, so Shamu show was pretty ""meh."" Blue Horizons was a ton of fun and way more than just the dolphins. Manta, a must for coaster enthusiasts (keep your head AGAINST the head rest at the start or you'll be sorry). Shipwrecked is super soggy fun-no, it's not Grizzly Rapids, but what you lose in any final drop you gain in ""oh my god, I cannot believe how much water just flew into my lap!"" and the same for Altantis, which does gain the drop, but adds in some weird intermediate elevator and ""this isn't going to dry you off, but you will get your mini coaster after the THOROUGH soaking"" in that strange order. My compatriot turned to me and said, "" my left shoe just filled completely with water!"" You have been warned.Listen folks, ya gotta go into it with the idea that you're there to have dorky fun, with all the appreciation of the little shows with their groans and creatures, which are really the main point aren't they (the creatures, not the groans, but who knows?). The place was clean and I thought the set dressing and overall production design of the place is much improved of old. Aquariums were sorta ""eh"", but go to Monterey Bay for that! Come on now. Gigantic lumbering herds of slow moving small family units coming out of the biggest stadiums could not dissuade us from having a low key good time.Motorcyclists: GREAT parking that was only $10@ for right up at the gate parking (19 slots that can be doubled up on with any companions, end to end, if need be and you don't have too monstrous a Harley). Yes, it's only $5 less than a car, but it's literally a rock throw from gate, way better than most cars.Manta: divest of all bags/hats/unsecurable/sensitive to water items in the lockers at the entrance to the ride. Free for first hour. Staff was super friendly and helpful, I was not at all a pain. Then again, we got there an hour and a half after opening, on a dreaded weekend, and we nearly walked onto the ride. Twice.Really ample people: at the entrance to the ride there is a sample ride seat. You must fit, and it's a bit snugger than many, so beware. Also, no above knee prosthetics, arm casts or full leg casts allowed. It's in the ""who cannot ride"" section. It's safety, folks, not your feelings. Buck up, bit beware.We enjoyed ourselves a lot with a pretty leisurely day of good old fashion soaking fun. Can't comment on the food, since we brought sandwiches and ate at the few picnic tables just outside the gate, which saved my stomach and our wallet from further indignities of a previous night of excess up in Old Town. Staff was helpful and friendly all over. What's not to like?"
2080,11/28/2010,5,"If you live in San Diego and have never been to sea world you should get your head checked, because you are probally mental. They have recently got rid of the beer college, and brings a tear to my eye."
2081,10/16/2012,2,I was very disappointed at how SMALL this place is. There are not enough attractions to justify the price you pay to go here for a day.... Sad.
2082,8/10/2010,4,"Seaworld rocks. I love the fact that an amusement park teaches us new things about animals and conservation. It is one of the coolest places!The two best shows were the Pets Rule and the Sea Lions Tonight. Funny and cleverly done. We loved how we could actually see the animals and what they are able to do. The orcas themselves are stunning and cool but ""Believe"", the Shamu show was so cheesy with the twirling video panels and Amy Grant-like music. The Dolphin show was the worst. A good 10 minutes of it was taken up by human circe de sole wannabes. They were amazing, but it really detracted from the main purpose of the show -- to see and learn more about dolphins. (And my toddler was really upset when Marina's house disappeared -- she kept asking what happened to it throughout the show...)The Arctic and Shark exhibits were first-class. We still can't get over that huge ice wall! And all the rides were really fun.The all day dining deal is great. We figured that the park must've lost $60 each on us. So awesome to be able to go in, grab a drink and not feel bad that you've just dropped $3 on a pop. We found that the food was really well-cooked for amusement park food. (The Deli turkey plate was one of our favorites, plus the Deli is really quiet and pleasant during the evening -- hardly any lines...)Overall Seaworld is definitely worth it, especially if you go during one of their buy a reduced price ticket and come back again free deals."
2083,5/29/2007,3,"Once in elementary school and once in middle school I took the ""Sleep Over"" trip to Sea World. In my memories I had an amazing time, but now that I have been back, older, on my own, I think I really just enjoyed the long bus ride with boys. Don't get me wrong there are still some things I love, like being able to pet and feed the bat rays, that never gets old (until they come up along the side and splash enormous amounts of nasty water onto you), and I still have so much fun on that stupid helicopter ride, just try to not smile on that ride. Among the list of things I didn't enjoy, the lack of jumping Shamu and his friends do now-a-days, the prices, waiting 45 minutes to pay for parking (it honestly took us 45 minutes to drive 1.5 miles! My lazy butt could have walked at least 2 in that time.), no straws or lids (I understand it's for the protection of the animals or what ever, but seriously I'm the messiest person in the world I need those things!), and they don't sell a single sweatshirt with a hood! Anyways I was pretty disappointed. They also lied on there phone times, telling me they opened at 10 a.m. when they really opened at 9a.m. Over all though every one was pretty nice and the ticket sales girl gave me a discount because my friend has AAA. I also got a lot of enjoyment out of seeing so many happy kids.My recommendations:-Bring Straws-If you have AAA use it for the discount (it saves about 10 dollars)-If you don't want to get wet, don't ride Atlantis, don't go see the 4D Movie, and don't sit in a the ""Soak Zone""-Don't go on Memorial Weekend, TOO CROWDED-Bring a child! There happy faces will ensure you a good time.I want to give it two and a half stars, but sense there is no half option, I give it 3, rounding up due to loving seaworld as a child."
2084,2/18/2008,5,"As our daughter approaches two years of age, we figured it was time to bite the bullet and get annual passes to Sea World. Our first trip was fairly predictable. She loved the dolphins, clapped furiously at the Shamu show, and was mesmerized by the sea otters. Best part of the day was when we discovered the posts along the sidewalk that, for 25 cents, will allow you to drench riders of the Shipwreck Rapids!!! She SQUEALED as we dropped quarter after quarter into the coin slot, and subsequently drenched unexpecting tourists. Well worth the price of admission!"
2085,5/11/2009,4,"*Extend right arm, extend left arm, put together* ""SHAMU SHAMU""I am 23 years old and this was my very first trip to Seaworld.LOVED IT!As an all-my-life Norcal-er I always went to Marine World in Vallejo for my killer whale fix, but when they started putting roller coasters up all over the place the park quickly lost it's appeal. I love that Seaworld still has it's values about and has exhibits and shows enforcing that importance of trainer/animal interactions and doing your part in preservation. The shows were great and my favorite part was petting the Bat Rays!!Now that I have a Fun Pass, I'll be back!! Post Note: Obviously a great place for kids...I am NOT jealous of the parents. Kudos to all of those harnessing overexcited kids screaming ""I wanna see the ____!!!"""
2086,5/11/2009,4,"Sea World is great for a young couple with kids. It's also great for a young at heart couple with no kids. I'd be part of the latter. We avoided parking, and paying for it, because we had taken a Gray Line shuttle from our hotel in downtown San Diego. We got there a about an hour after it opened and was happy to find it wasn't too crowded (yet). We grabbed a map and were on our way. We were able to hit all the big shows in the first half of our day: Shamu, Sea Lions Live and the Dolphins. For a girl who had never been to Sea World, these were pretty freakin' cool. I grew up a little over 2 hours from Sea World Orlando, but spent my childhood at Disney. I have seen similar dolphin shows at the Marineland in St. Augustine. But nothing compares to Shamu. I was impressed not only by the size of the whales, but by how close and what the trainers could actually do with them. The dolphins are always impressive with their high jumps and flips. But of the three, the Sea Lions (and the little otter) were my favorite. They just have such a sass to them that makes the show fun to watch. There are a few other shows in the park, including a Pets Rule show, which was a lot of fun to watch for this dog lover. Getting to 'experience' the animals and see all the different exhibits was a lot of fun. Food-wise we made out pretty well. We ate at Calypso Smokehouse (at least I think that was the name). We split the sampler platter and ordered two drinks. As always, it was a little pricier than most meals, but it was a lot of food and we were both really satisfied. Would I go back? For sure. But I want to go back to SD Zoo first."
2087,2/7/2008,4,"Holy cow when did SeaWorld get so expensive? Â It had been a few years since I'd been to SeaWorld but I sure don't remember it being that expensive to get in and to park, good thing I wasn't paying for them.I took my nephews here back in December, we did have a great time even though the ride I wanted to go on Journey to Atlantis was closed and the one exhibit I wanted to see the Manatee Exhibit was also closed. Â We did enjoy the day we started at the Wild Artic where they went on the 'ride' you know the simulated helicopter ride that makes people like me want to vomit but 10 and 15 year old boys love it. Â I waited for them like a good aunt. Â After viewing Wild Artic we went into the penguin encounter, I use to really love this place but it looks like it hasn't received much love in the last few years, poor things.After that I'm not sure where we went next but we did see the sharks, I love the shark encounter! Â We watched Clyde and Seamore blow up a submarine, we saw the haunted lighthouse and thankfully the water for my chair was broken! Â We went on Shipwreck Rapids and let me tell you when they say you'll get soaked you'll get soaked! Â I was soaking wet for the rest of the day it was horrible but I was a trooper and carried on. Â At this point we went to find something to eat, unfortunately everyone else also had the same idea we decided against food and went for drinks and churros, and I have to say it was one of the worst churros ever! Â I was so sad, so, so sad but I got over it while waiting for the Shamu show to start. Â After Shamu we saw the dolphins and at some point we fed the seals and sea lions, well I didn't the 10 year old did, I just paid for it.At this point we were done seeing everything we wanted to see so I let them go play at Coco Loco Arcade and use their money to play games. Â I even got in on the action, we had fun, stuffed animals were won, tickets were won, money was gone so we headed home. Â Over all it was fun I liked it and since I didn't have to pay it's still gets four stars from me otherwise I'd have to knock it down to three star."
2088,7/12/2008,4,"I came here with my husband, but we didn't really have the best time - a little bored actually...but coming back with my niece and sisters was a different story - we had a blast!!If you want to do EVERY ride and show, you really can't do it all in one day because of the spacings of the show, especially if it is crowded. Â Right now they have a special thought where you buy one day and you get the rest of the year for free, we came here for another half day to finish up what we didn't. Â Manatee rescue was closed which was disappointing but everything else was great. Â We fed the stingrays, fed the dolphins.Since we couldn't do everything in one day, the first day we decided to do the rides and the shows. The 2nd half-day we were there we had breakfast with Shamu which was amazing, you really just eat while you hear the trainers speaking but you can hang out with them for Q&A as long as you want and you are incredibly close to the orca's. Â There were 3 of them out at once, and one of my photos actually gained me a ""picture of the day"" on traveljournals...anyway...the 2nd day we dedicated to seeing and feeding the animals. Â Overall it was a good split between the two because you get soaked on the rides and during the shows. Â Definitely a good time.WHAT SUCKS THOUGH - price of the food. Â This is one of the worst amusement park food rip offs I have ever encountered in my life!"
2089,7/8/2011,4,"There were a lot of people here for the 4th of July weekend, but my wife and I still had a lot of fun. Â We watched all of the shows except for the Sesame Street and the Pets Rule.The shows were good, a little on the corny side, but still good. Â We witnessed an equipment malfunction during the Blue Horizons dolphin show and one of the crew workers had to rescue the lady stuck on wires in the middle of the pool.The sea lions were not behaving very well (probably because of the heat) and didn't want to perform 1/4 of the tricks, but it was still very entertaining. Â Here's some advice that I feel I need to give:1. Purchase your tickets online if you're looking to save some money. Â There's a McDonald's promo code that you can enter: SWCMcDonaldsLA2011.2. Bring a backpack and place your electronics in a zip lock bag if you plan on doing anything where you might get wet.3. Bring a water bottle so that you can fill it up at the various drinking fountains throughout the park. Â We calculated the amount of water we would have had to pay without the water bottle and we saved a total of $36 on water alone.4. Get there early in the morning so that you park close to the entrance. Â This makes it easier if you want to leave food in an igloo in your vehicle. Â Don't forget to get your hand stamped so that you can get back in again.5. Bring lots of sunscreen. Â You'll end up paying too much at the park if you don't.6. Bring a hat. Â It gets hot when you're sitting and not moving around. Â We sat down early for the shows in order to get better seats and we were baking under the sun.Have fun!"
2090,8/25/2008,5,"Gosh... I am convinced that I am literally a kid in heart. Â Even though I am 26 years old, but I have never Â been to seaworld, so finally my awesome bf took me down there last weekend!! It was just so much fun!! All the animals were so entertaining, and so talented! Every shows were creative and enjoyable. Â My very favorite one were the Â sea lion shows!! It was amazing and spectacular! We were there about 5 hours, we would stay longer, but the heat really got to us, so we have to get out. hehe..Down to the real review: Food! Â sorry guys, didn't eat there... it was too hot to really eat, so we spurged on those yummy Frozen Lemonade slushies! haha! It's actually not very expensive, about 3.80 per cup! Â So yummy! I don't even know how many we've got! hehe...Saving tips: If you have AAAuto card, they have a special offer just for members only. We only paid $46 per person. It's a pretty good discount compares to paying $61 regular fee. I love being with the animals... they makes me happy and at eased. Â :)"
2091,10/14/2010,5,"This review is for a SILVER PASS holder. Ok... so I live in San Diego, but rarely ever go to SeaWorld.... then fast-foward to 2010 where I have a 1 year old daughter who is now all about wandering around and people/animal watching! waaaahooo! Thank goodness for SeaWorld and their annual passes! Even better? the Buy one year, get one free deal they have right now. Suhhh-weet. Paid $109 for a two year pass with free parking. Plus 10% off everything we buy in the park. NICE. Now we go at least once a month and sometimes two weeks back to back... just a couple hours at a time. We haven't even gone to see very many shows yet, but just enjoy the walk and letting our daughter soak up the scene. I was pretty impressed with their whole Halloween Spooktacular theme for this month. FUN! loved seeing all the kiddos dressed up and they had everything in theme around the park. Good stuff! One thing I am greatful for: Calypso BBQ... the ONLY place we eat at inside the park. its DAMN good. The Reef place is bleh cafeteria food... Mama Stellas is ""aight"".... but its Calypso all the way! looking forward to checking out other parts of the park and more shows as my daughter gets more into it. =)"
2092,8/28/2011,1,"In two days at Sea World we experienced everything the park had to offer. Â We discovered that they no longer actually talk about the animals in the shows. Â Shamu is now about saving the oceans, which I support but I wanted to hear about the WHALES at the WHALE show. Â Also, for safety reasons the trainers no longer go into the water.The dolphin show, Blue Horizons, is absolutely terrible! For 10 of the 25 minutes the dolphins aren't even in the water! Â It is all performers dancing around in horrid bird costumes. Â Trainers not in the water much for this either, and no dolphin facts are given.Handicapped beware! A member of our group with a walker was unable to bring his walker in many areas of the park. Â He was told by employees that his walker was a 'stroller' and 'prohibited.' The food was properly priced for a theme park, though it was not quality by any means. Â I ignored the terrible show reviews on Yelp before our visit, and I really wish I hadn't."
2093,7/30/2009,3,"About a year ago my sister and I would go here almost every week whenever we were bored because we had the year passes. I don't know if they do it anymore, but they used to have beer school. Well I couldn't think of a better idea then to have that at an amusement park. Just think about it, it's hot, your kids are whining and all you want is a cold one for less than 9 bucks a beer. Oh wow, you get three tasting sized cups, which are actually pretty generous. Luckily my sisters bf doesn't drink, so we had double the fun and actually had a nice buzz as we floated off to see Shamu. Most definitely stop by the Buzzweiser factory during your stay. (But of course you must be 21 to ride this ride)"
2094,11/8/2012,4,What a great place to take your kids! It has a little bit of everything for the whole family...even my 4 month old nephew enjoyed it or at least I think he did!
2095,11/28/2009,4,Sea World is really nice. Â We went there the day before thanksgiving so it was not as busy as it could be. Â The Shamu shows is pretty amazing. Â We didn't get there until 2:00 so we didn't get to do as much as we like.I have to say the one disappointing thing was they charge extra to ride the Sky Tower ($3 per person). Â It's pretty expensive just to get in so they should include everything.
2096,5/28/2008,5,"I had mixed expectations after I read some of the other Yelp reviews, but was pleasantly surprised by how much there was to do and how much the entire family enjoyed it. Â I'll say that you could see everything in one day, so it's not a place that you need multiple days to see.I saw and enjoyed these shows/exhibits very much:-Shamu-Cirque de la Mar (acrobats show)-Dolphins-Polar Bears (whole exhibit is well done)-Sharks (awesome view at the end)-aquarium (piranhas too)-horse stable with beautiful horses and they pose for pictures-4D Sesame street show-COMPLIMENTARY sanitary products for women in the bathrooms. Â This is truly good customer service. Â Management here is genius. Â You women understand how much we appreciate not having to dig up the right coins to deal with that machine that doesn't work half the time... Â So THANK YOU Sea World!!"
2097,10/18/2015,2,"Just went yesterday. My husband and my daughter has never been. Let me say that we won't be going again. Ever. The park is just lacking. The shows were barely entertaining. I mean in all fairness what can you really expect from dolphins and whales. The dolphin show and Shamu show was the exact same except for the type of animal of course. During the Shamu show my 7 year old daughter asked why one of the Orcas had a bent fin. It was curved in. Not until I got home and researched why, I was truly disappointed. I actually came across Blackfish documentary and felt guilt the whole night. I will not be supporting Sea World again. I'm not saying the trainers at Sea World mistreat the animals there but I feel they should be in their natural environment. Being able to see an animal up close does not benefit mankind at all. Â I must admit the rides Journey to Atlantis and Manta was pretty good. Very creative rides. That's what gave Sea World an extra star. We ate at Cafe 64 who raved about their burgers but I could of settled with Wendy's. I guess the most important thing for me was making sure the kiddos had a good time but I saw my daughter more excited at Johns Incredible Pizza. Â LegoLand was even better. I hate giving bad reviews, wait this is my first bad review. Ever. Sorry Sea World. I won't be Sea-ing you again."
2098,7/25/2010,3,"Been here a few times and unfortunately it is always the same. HOT, HUMID and VERY EXPENSIVE. Don't get me wrong I think the kids love this place but I am a blue eyed, red headed, fair skinned white guy. Can we say serious sunburn bordering on heat stroke!! There is literally no shade anywhere in the park. Maybe they do this to sell more expensive drinks (water $2.75 a bottle). Like I said I am not really a fan but must go to for tourists. Take lots of sun screen and water if you can sneak it in the park."
2099,6/29/2012,4,"Seaworld was a fun experience! Â I definitely want to go back when my baby brother is older. Â :D Â I remember when I watched Shamu Jr. in Florida when I was littler. Â Fun for the family; now I'm going to list the cons and pros. Â CONS: Â -food: did not like the kids meals alot... liked how they made cute little Shamu boxes. Â Did not like how their nuggets were like McDonalds, only worse. Â -tide pool. Â Really needs more staff to check around! Â I'd work there. Â That's because I really hate how the kids, doesn't matter if they're 12 and under, do NOT listen to the staff, who should patrol the exhibit and not just shout the rules. Â Kids were turning over the starfish and leaving them there! Â - I'm sad that there was not a lot of killer whale riding with the trainers and whales . . . I understand if they are scared from the death of the swallowed trainer. Â PROS: Â  Â -loved the dolphin show. Â Like circus acts and amazing tricks combined! Â So many beautiful colors, interaction, and talented performers. Â -seal show. Â Oh my gosh, it was cool! Â Talented animals, and the funny intro is a must-see. Â  Â -fun Atlantic ride, but did not last that long. Â I explained to the staff there that I was not with a parent since my mother was pregnant (dad was at work), and she was nice and paired me up with a nice woman and her two daughters. Â Great customer service. Â c:"
2100,11/30/2012,4,"We went for an afternoon on a weekday in the middle of November and it was not crowded at all. We really enjoyed the Shamu show (make sure you get to see it!), and also the Dolphins... kids get to touch them as well! Did not have time for any of the rides.4 stars because it is so expensive... the all year pass is just a good deal if you live in the area and/or have kids. I saw later that they sell combination tickets with Universal studios. Craigslist might be an option."
2101,5/12/2009,5,"What can I say about Seaworld that hasn't already been said? Only don't go during their Viva la Musica festival unless you're there to see the singer/group/performance. Otherwise you'll encounter long lines and certain areas closed off due to the long lines. That was my only complaint.Seaworld is another place I could not get tired of. I could probably sit there and watch the killer whales, beluga whales or the penguins for hours. If only there weren't annoying people around, then I would. But the shows are great, most of them anyways. They just changed the sea lion show recently. It's now called Sea Lions Live as in SNL and parody a lot of the reality shows. Some of the same tricks are in there but still ahhh-ingly entertaining. The Shamu show just oozes cheese but come on, you have to go see it - it's basically the main attraction. And I know the Sesame Streets 4D show is geared towards little kids but maybe they need to reevaluate. Every time there was a loud noise or the seats shook or water sprayed at you, there would be lots and lots of crying. And definitely do not miss the nighttime shows if they're being offered - usually pretty different than the daytime shows. As for the rides, Atlantis is pretty fun, especially the first time you go on it - it will surprise you about where it goes. Sit in the back if you don't want to get that wet. And you will get soaked on the Shipwreck rapids - that's a certainty no matter where you sit. Â Some of my other favorite highlights include feeding the flamingos and ducks for a mere 50 cents. Compared to the sea lion, bat ray or dolphin feedings for $6, that's a steal. And the Shipwreck CafÃ© - if you have to eat at Seaworld, eat here. Ribs, burgers, and specialty dishes cooked to order and scrumptious desserts. They used to have free beer tastings at the Budweiser Hospitality Suite but I think that ended in February. The park layout can be confusing so refer to your map a lot. And then there's the ""skyride to nowhere."" I haven't ridden it but it literally goes off the map so I have no idea where it takes you or if it takes you back to the park."
2102,5/16/2010,3,"Sea World and I have a love-hate relationship. It's complicated.Parking is 12 bucks, lunch ends up being around 12 bucks a person, tickets prices are higher than Cheech and Chong, not to mention overpriced snacks literally EVERY corner you turn.HIGHLIGHTS:-When my friend and I bought our tickets, the lady asked us something really quietly. When he asked her to repeat it, she literally screamed ""I ASKED FOR YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND AREA CODE!!!""-On the spinning ride in Shamu's Happy Harbor (errr.. Bay of Play now) with the wannabe Zoey character, you aren't allowed to wear an unzipped jacket. Nope. If you're wearing a buttonless or zipperless cardigan, you will be asked to got off.-When we saw Pets Rule, the dogs started... gettin' busy. -4 people threw up on Wild Arctic all on the same ride. Omen?"
2103,9/5/2013,1,Ugh. Never again!!!! Never go to SeaWorld!!!! It's cruel and depressing. I hated it as a kid because I could tell the animals were miserable. I got talked into going again and I hated it even more as an adult. I wish I had never even seen the horrible condition those creatures live in. It's disgusting. Plus the park is run down and seedy and nasty and WAY too expensive for everything. Give me Magic Mountain or Disneyland or even the local park any day!!!!
2104,6/24/2011,1,"Although there were many parts of the park that my family enjoyed (including the Sesame Street world), I have to give it one star because I felt so bad for the animals. In particular, it broke my heart to see how confined the dolphins and killer whales were. They are magnificent and beautiful creatures. If Seaworld truly cared for them and they were truly not able to be put back into the wild, they could at least build them a significantly bigger swimming pool. These poor creatures have no choice but to swim in circles and do tricks for food. I"
2105,11/27/2011,2,"The shows have gone down hill now that the trainers aren't allowed in the water with the whales. Â Dolphin show was kind of corny. Â The animal exhibits are small and limited. Â I don't regret going, as I think it's something you should do once in your life, and possibly a 2nd time for your kiddies. Â The only part I genuinely enjoyed was the night show, ""sea lions tonite."" Â They pretty much make fun of the other shows (and Justin Bieber). Â Guy playing janitor was hilarious.Shows were definitely a lot cooler when I was younger."
2106,4/6/2011,4,"I remember going here often when i was a kid and actually enjoying it. Â Maybe because I didn't have to pay anything, thanks mom and dad lol....Went here last year and it can get pricey when it comes to food and souvenirs. Â I still like hanging out here and people watch lol."
2107,10/12/2007,4,"I had not been to Sea World, since I was a little tyke and wanted to be in the front row of the soak zone for the Shamu show. The park was beautifully kept and very clean. I was a little shocked at the $57 per person entry fee, but hey, if it goes to helping the animals then what the heck. Thankfully, my little ones are still at the free age. I was a little supprised to see that 3 year olds cost $50 to get in, especially since of the few rides they have, many 3 year olds would not be able to participate based on height and or weight.We really enjoyed the Shamu Believe show, enjoyed the dolphin feeding, and the Shark exhibit. We were a bit disappointed, that they closed the penguin and polar bear exhibit early for a private event. I wish they would have put a sign up at the entry saying these attractions would close early that day. Â I would have altered our walk around the park to see these."
2108,4/1/2010,4,"This place is r-a-d!I watched a pool of dolphins play with basketballs! I musta stood there for 20 minutes.I touched a bat ray! It was creepy!Really fun!Some old lady in a scooter got REALLY mad at me for no reason, and her friend tried to karate chop me, but other than that, I loved my first visit to Sea World!"
2109,10/12/2012,3,"The day and night shows are fun to watch. Some are kind of ridiculous like the dolphin show with random birds and divers. Manta is actually quite fun. The line wasn't as bad as I thought. For some reason I was able to move through it very quickly even though I started at the top where they first have the ""wait from here"" sign"
2110,7/31/2010,3,"I'm quite torn in writing this review. Seeing a 35 foot Killer Whale demonstrate its athletic abilities in person is simply stunning. The other shows were much less enthraling, but still fun for our three-year old. We appreciated the touch tanks and aquariums. The Shark Encounter was pretty cool, albeit brief. Elmo's world inside the park is really good for youngsters.I think my main gripe was the total cost of the experience relative to alternatives such as the Long Beach and Monterrey Aquariums. I expect theme park admission to be expensive, and Seaworld was no exception - $60 each for kids? But the price of additional activities inside the park really got under my skin over the course of the day. The food prices make movie theaters seem reasonable, and paying $6 just to be next to your kid (also $6) so he can toss a sardine to a dolphin is pretty nickle-and-dime. But they know you will pay it for your kid's sake, and so there we are. You can have my money, but not my good review, for souring an otherwise fun family activity.3 Stars, because of ""Shamu""."
2111,9/9/2007,5,"My boyfriend and I went to Seaworld in August 2006 and we had a GREAT time. We were so pooped from the zoo the day before, we slept in and didn't get to Seaworld until a little before lunch. I wish we had gotten there earlier because we didn't get to go on a single ride! We saw all the shows though and they were great. Well, some were better than others. Dolphin show was great, the whale one was pretty cheezy, but the sea otter/seal show was HILARIOUS! You have to see that show last though because it mocks all the other shows. Oh, and you have to sit in the splash zone because that's half the fun. We saw the Cirque De La Mer show too...and we could have skipped that.We ate at Mango Joe's and I'd give that place a 2 out of 5 stars. The BBQ place where we also ate, I'd give a 5 out of 5! The line was loooong, but for a good reason. The food was GREAT!If you go, go early, bring minimal amount of bags/backpacks/purses. Make sure the ones you do bring, you don't mind getting wet. Oh yeah, I wore my bathing suit under my clothes because I knew I was going to get wet, either by the shows or the rides. Oh, and wear sunscreen!My boyfriend and I didn't have any kids with us to slow us down and we barely saw the entire park (and we were there from 11 until closing at 10 or 11). If you have kids, I suggest you take more than one day to see everything."
2112,1/13/2008,5,"Some people feel differently regarding having animals in tanks and whatnot. I worked at SeaWorld, and I can tell you that every employee takes great pride and care in their job... this includes the photographers, the entertainers, the animal trainers, the landscapers (don't fuck with their flowers! haha), the cooks, the charicature artists, everyone. What makes it such a great place to be is the atmosphere of employees who actually like to be there.What a lot of people don't know is that SeaWorld has an amazing rehabilitation department, which helps and re-releases animals that have been wounded in the wild and also an amazing education department, not to mention the hoards of facts advertised in each exhibit as well as the trainers/education employees in each exhibit standing there telling you facts, in case you're too lazy to read. They also have a camp behind SeaWorld dedicated to educating kids - ever seen those groups of kids wearing the same colored shirts singing annoying songs? That would be them, haha! Many of the animals have been born and raised within the park and wouldn't survive in the wild, so technically, people who preach that they should be released are encouraging their death. Twiiiisted.Everyone feels differently regarding what SeaWorld ""is about"" and to each their own. SeaWorld is a great place and it's fun for the family. Yeah, it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for... And the money you pay pretty much goes to the animals, respectively... not a big-wig at Anheuser-Busch :)"
2113,6/23/2008,5,"Great place for all. Go see the last showing of""Shamu"" it's a plus!All ride are a-OK. Aminals were spectacular. They do tricks. Imagine your pet dog or cat doing something unusual..Cool huh? Many show s to catch. Bring suntan lotion and water."
2114,7/7/2008,3,"We were so excited to come here with my family after not being here since I was kid which was over 20 plus years ago.The shows: The Shamu show and Dolphin show weren't that great. Â I was bored by the end of both shows. Â The shamu show didn't have any amazing tricks like they did up here in NorCal at the Vallejo's Marineworld. Â There was the guy that was singing in the beginning in the Dolphin show that tried to get people excited but that didn't do the trick either.It was over 85 degrees when we went but thank God there was a nice breeze that helped the heat. Â There aren't any trees that will help you cool down in heat only Â places to sit down occasionally under dining areas. Â The whole place was an open place.I don't think we'll be back for awhile. Â I wish we RSVP'd for the ""Dine with Shamu"" and then watched the ""Shamu Rocks show"" which started at 8pm but my kids and my dad didn't make it until then so we left. Â Next time we'll do the ""Dine with Shamu"" in the evening around 6:45pm and then do the ""Shamu Rocks"" which gives all the people that RSVP'd for the dine priority seats.For $51 it was expensive. Â We got the 2nd day free to use sometime this year. Â We'll see if we do."
2115,9/8/2009,2,"It had been awhile since I've been to Sea World. I was a kid last time I was here and I barely remembered it.For the rides, there were two of them. We went on Shipwreck Rapids. Waited for 90 minutes for a short ride that wasn't that good, besides getting soaked. You really get soaked, which was great. But not worth the wait.Journey to Atlantis is an AWESOME ride. I don't want to spoil it for you, but I highly recommend it. A long wait, but worth it, especially if you can do it at an off-hour. Everyone knows that the Shamu show is amazing and that the Dolphin show is awesome. They are must sees.The Manatee rescue was pretty neat, though subliminally sexual. That statue out front. Haha...On the Riptide Stage, there was a pretty cool non-water all-human show. It wasn't amazing or anything. Kind of like what you'd expect from a college dance show.My issue with Sea World is that besides the animals, most things suck. The employees are very rude. I had one screaming in my ear for no reason. Half of my family was in the Sesame Street show and they wouldn't let the rest of us in. Even though the half that got in said there was plenty of room. And she felt the need to shout when I was standing right next to her. Ugh.So yeah, do Sea World because it's Sea World and it does have some attractions. But it really isn't all that."
2116,7/14/2011,1,"Why sell kids toys and such with notices posted everywhere that they might contain LEAD and can harm your child????Why are you selling CHEAP products that are NOT safe and or made in the USA?Sea World for kids, come at your own risk...."
2117,4/24/2007,5,"Never really enjoyed amusement parks much until I visited Sea World recently. They have great food choices for everybody! The rides are fun but not overwhelming, they are acceptable for all members of the family.One should always bring a change of clothes if planning to go on some of these rides.We went there first thing in the morning and all the rides were easy to enter. Â Great shows too!Prepare ahead of time by printing show schedules and arranging your time accordingly. There are a few extras to pay for but compared to everything in life, it does not surprise me.Oh! Try the free beer samples (east from the gate). I even had a buzz while watching Shamu. Can't beat that!"
2118,4/6/2009,3,"It was a Saturday so it was extremely packed. Strollers, obnoxious children and all. The shows were great and exciting. I loved the aquariums, but too much people crowding around kills the experience. I was super excited to come see the beluga whales, but was disappointed to only realize it only swam around in circles. Food here is extremely expensive... to the point I felt like I wanted to skip lunch. We ate at Mama Stella's Kitchen or whatever.... and we spent $42 on ... 2 REALLY small cheese pizzas, and 2 plates of samplers. AH!! SMALL SMALL SMALL!! RIP OFF... especially when you're trying to feed 4 adults. Definitely have a big meal before coming in. You can't even bring food or drinks in except water. Parking is $12."
2119,3/7/2012,4,SeaWorld is a great place to hangout and watch the mighty whales do their thing! Â The fireworks over Mission Bay rock as well. Â I had a place in Bay Park for years and would watch the fireworks daily in the summertime.
2120,4/25/2010,4,"I like the Sea world a lot. It is one of the first things for out of towners to do in SD.Get around the crazy parking fee by getting a season pass; free parking for a year.Just love the rescue animal show, many others that came and went. Shows change probably yearly depending on popularity.GREAT place."
2121,8/29/2010,3,"Going to Â a theme park as an adult is SO different from a kid. I loved sea world growing up. This past time i went i realized just how expensive these outings are! Admission was $69!! On top of that, once you get in the park, every 10 feet there is another opportunity for you to spend money. I just don't feel like there were enough attractions/exhibits at sea world to justify the expense of admission.  I do love the shark reef- nothing in comparison to Monterey Bay Aquariums shark exhibit, but its definitely very cool and interesting."
2122,10/21/2012,4,"Love the shows~ Â They now have turkey legs n roast corn, YUM~!! Â Went mainly to take my son Trick or Treating. Â  Many stations, good for little ones, no long lines. Â  Go around as many times as you like. Â  Sea lion show had a Halloween theme to it~ Â Very funny pre-show also. :D"
2123,3/9/2009,5,First Theme Park. First Field Trip. First Job.Do they still have pay a day and get the rest of the year free?It's worth it.The Shamu Show at night is tight. They have HUGE moving LCD screens that dance during the show.
2124,5/19/2009,4,"Things I liked: The Shamu Believe show!!! WOW! The dolphin show wasn't too bad, but I think the dolphin show at my local Brookfield Zoo in Chicago is better. The aquariums were nice too, but I've seen better. Loved the shark tank with the underwater tunnel (if only it wasn't on conveyer belt forcing you to hurry thru). Didn't like: The fact that a couple rides were down. So few shows during the day that you have to rush from one to another to catch the good ones. Still missed the sea lion and seals show."
2125,5/1/2010,3,"Being someone that has gone to Sea World a whole hell of a lot over the last 40 some odd years. It is still a good day to completely waste a day. The rides are not anything different than anything you would find at Knott's Berry Farm (for less that Sea World admission). The one thing that Sea World gives is the sea life experience, if you wan tot see animals that live in the water, this is the place to be.I enjoy the shows a lot, the Shamu show, the Sea Lion show, the pet show, all are above par and I can watch the same show over and over and over again without issue.If there were no other amusement parks in the area to compare it too, then I would probably give it a 5 star review, but I must admit, Knott's Berry Farm is cheaper and offers more rides than Sea World. Though Sea World is more educational and more water oriented. I still think the price point for the amusement park is way over board. $70 for a ticket... that is almost like bending me over and jamming a rusty pole up my sphincter.I will say, after leaving the place and trying to get back on the 5 freeway to head home, I saw a homeless guy in a wheelchair, probably one of the dirtiest guys I had seen in a long time, carrying a sign that said, I bet you $1.00 that you will read this sign... that was the high light of the Sea World day"
2126,8/14/2007,4,"Dont eat at ship wreck cafe (restaurant inside) ! ! The food is not good and is not worth the price.Bring some sandwiches, and lots of water. Dont forget the sunblock and wear a hat. you might need a jacket at night.Try to go on a weekday, and early (like 10:30) so you could do more."
2127,6/14/2009,5,"I have the Silver Passport, so I can go into SeaWorld pretty much anytime I want. I have been coming ever since I was small so I know this park pretty well. There is so much to say, so I'll just touch on the highlights.Worthy Rides:Journey to Atlantis: is awesome for a little rush & to get soaked.Shipwreck Rapids: this is the go to place to get totally soakedWild Arctic: lame simulator ride, but you can skip it to just get into the viewing area where you can see polar bears, baluga whales, fish, etc.Bay of Play area: it's the kids area so the kids will love this placeWorthy exhibits:Penguins: Just like Happy Feet, haha.Sharks: a little less like JawsManta Rays: you can touch these guys, so weird.Dolphins: you can feed them, too cool.Sea Otters, Fish, there are so much more that you must check out! Worthy Shows:Sea Lion show: too funnyDolphin Show: cute stuffPets Rule!: toooo cuteShamu Show: a MUST!Fireworks display: c'mon you have to finish your day with this!Okay, so all in all, a great place to go with whoever or even by yourself. Summer season is the most crowded but worth it because they have extra things to show! Marine animals are so amazing so this is a must to do when you're visiting San Diego!"
2128,8/2/2010,4,Fair prices for the food and souvenirs as oppose to the other theme parks here in california. I enjoyed the shows and other forms of entertainment. The rides where you get wet were pretty fun as well. I think they really stepped up their game. Don't miss the late shamu show ! I dont think there was a time when I was extremely bored every place we went throughout the park was pretty fun. I can't wait to return :)
2129,8/18/2009,2,"It was a good place to go and kill some time. The shows were ok, the food sucked, and 2 of the rides you have to pay extra money to ride.I did feel sorry for the orca wales and dolphins because they need more room to swim.GO TO THE SAN DIEGO ZOO"
2130,1/19/2014,5,"When I first thought of the idea of coming here I wasn't to sure. After my first visit, I was very impressed. I honestly love coming here. The shows are entertaining and the ride, Manta, is awesome. I got the buy a day get the year free so I will definitely be coming back."
2131,1/25/2013,5,I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Sea World San Diego. It was so much fun both times I've gone. regular summer day and Christmas special. My girlfriend and I love Sea World! Â Customer service is great :)
2132,8/24/2012,4,I love this place I love animals :) watching shamu is fun but the soak zone is not for me the water is so salty it burns ur eyes as soon as u dry up ur clothes is stiff and u feel all the salt on ur face ewww other than that it's a great experience for the kids my little girl loved it
2133,9/11/2012,4,"I spent one week at SeaWorld. Â I had more fun than I expected. Â The shows were wonderful and the people were great. Â I could not, however, eat any of the food served at the park! Â I know they advertise that they use healthy oil but all of the food eventually made me sick to my stomach, except for the special Dine with Shamu food. Â I wish they allowed one to bring in their own snacks."
2134,8/10/2010,5,"What is there not to love about SeaWorld? I have been going here ever since I was a kid, and have always loved it. I've been taking my son once or twice a week ever since he was 4 months old (it's hard not to when you only live 2 miles away). Great for kids, teenagers, adults, you name it. If you're in San Diego for a trip, take a day to go, the price is well worth it! If you live in San Diego, definitely get an annual pass. The low price pays for itself in 2-3 visits. Like I mentioned above, I still go once or twice a week, even if it's only for an hour to visit my son's favorite exhibits and to take him on Elmo's Flying Fish."
2135,9/9/2010,4,"The wife and I went to SeaWorld today and had a fabulous time. Since all the kids are in school and parents are working there were very little amount of people there today. Â If it had been a hot day or a full park my rating would be a lot different.The shows are funny and have a good story line. The rides are fun and well built to be a whole experience. The park is small and easy to walk throughout the day. The biggest problem I see is the over pricing of everything. In addition to your ticket price you get to pay a whole lot more for everything you do after you enter the park. Most amusement parks overprice food, but at SeaWorld they charge for everything so much I was surprised the restrooms were free to use.Great fun, but be mindful of the day you are going, the crowds of people and the extra money you will need to enjoy the park."
2136,9/5/2012,4,Sea World is a great place!!! we took my almost 2 year old daughter here and she had a great time! But you must have at least two days to see everything the shows are great the animals look like they are well taken care of and they even have a great selection of food! Will have to come back when the baby is older and watch some of the other shows that they had there! Great Times!!!
2137,11/8/2009,3,"Changes since my last review:-no more beer school, though the building is still there-apparently the clydesdale horses won't be there much longer; it's worth seeing these massive animals-there's now a Wild Arctic interaction like DIP. Â It's expensive, but sounds awesome.-it seems like Rocky Point doesn't really have too many potential dolphin interactions, or at least it wasn't happening when I was there.-Dine With Shamu is a great way to see the killer whales and their behaviors up close. Â The food is fine, but it's the experience of eating next to the whales that is really cool."
2138,4/10/2011,1,"How disappointing....I won't return. Â Sea World is offering credentialed teachers a free year's pass. Â Great, my wife and I think we both have a credential and are teachers we can go and take our 5 year old. Â Great until they told us my wife can't get a pass because she has a 30 day emergency permit. Â I don't know where the disconnect is but our employer told us a 30 day would work. Â Guess not. Â Customer service was poor-they even made me walk back to the car to get proof of my parking pass so I could get a refund. Â We are off to the zoo instead. Â They know how to treat customers."
2139,9/15/2009,4,"Not too many rides here, but definitely worth coming to again and again. Just to get this out of the way, SKIP the fun card pass, and grab the annual pass. Here's what you get with the annual pass that you DON""T get with the FUN Card:- Free parking- No Black out Dates- VIP Card (3 free photos, 30% off dining, $20 off up to 6 guests each visit)- Discounts off EVERYTHING in the park (dining, souvenirs, even the little carts with frozen lemonade and ice cream)- Special days only for annual pass members that give you free gifts (stuff like tote bags and such)This place has always got something going on. You can jump from show to show, catch a few fish to look at, then ride atlantis or the Rapids.My Recommendations for shows:- The Dolphins- The Seal Lions- And of course, ShamuThere's lots to do if you plan your day out right, and time the shows after looking at fish or getting off a ride. Just remember, skip the Fun Card and go for Annual Pass!"
2140,8/24/2013,1,"Overpriced and poorly managed. Â If cruelty to animals is your thing go ahead and pay the over $70 day price. Â My teenager purchased a souvenir from the gift shop, was short changed by a lot and the clerk denied that it happened 2 minutes after we realized and returned. Â The ""acting"" manager refused to do anything about it giving us an option that seemed like it was offered to discourage us from pursuing the money back. Â After over an hour of waiting the ""actual"" manager showed unapologetic to our situation with 3 ""security"" guards. Â Way to end a families day at the park! Â Make them feel like criminals for your incompetent and rude staff. Â Never again will I spend even a dollar supporting this or other like facilities or what they represent."
2141,7/2/2012,3,"Sigh I guess it's cool for locals and people who havent been to Florida but its tiny compared to Orlando. Â A lot of their equipment is shotty too, the jumbo tron had a dead patch of pixels and their microphones kept breaking up. Â Too many birds too."
2142,6/28/2013,2,"Going here makes me feel guilty for obvious reasons-people are profiting from making what should be wild creatures provide entertainment to the masses. Sure, the animals are obviously well cared for and many are there as rescues-but the ""show"" part of it seems more and more unnecessary. On to the review-when we pulled up I was asked if I wanted upgraded parking (I did)-shelled out 20 and was told someone would direct me-no one was there, doubt I ended up in the premium parking and paid extra for naught. This park is just not well marked at all, and it's annoying. Not even signs that say EXIT, which I really wanted to find. There were so many obnoxious, unsupervised teenagers and stroller jams when we went that it just wasn't fun. My biggest criticism isn't necessarily the park's fault-going here will demonstrate what inconsiderate IDIOTS and sorry parents some people can be. Stopping right in the middle of a crowded path to read their maps, blocking everything with their strollers, letting their kids go wild and push their way in/cut in lines, etc.-ugh-if you're a native Californian it's really not worth going when all the tourists go. To add insult to injury-in a feeble attempt to console myself I stopped at the exit (I finally found it!) for a Starbucks iced caramel machiatto for the ride home. They handed me one in a plastic cup with no lid. Hello?? Your stand is positioned at the exit, and I'm getting in the car!! ""Sorry, we don't provide lids, but we can pack your iced drink in the paper cup we serve hot coffee in, and you can sip it through the little sippy hole."" For a hefty $5 I got a soggy paper cup that disintegrated in my car cup holder and a crappy machiatto. KMA, Sea World and Starbucks."
2143,2/20/2010,4,"The girlfriend really loves shows, especially those involving animals. Â So naturally, this was a place she definitely wanted to hit on our Valentines/Chinese New Year/her birthday mini-vacation in San Diego.Online, I got onto ""buy a membership this year (2010) and get the next for free"" deal. Â I figured I'd still be with the gal and she'd want to come back and I'd have two years to do so.Well, clearly this was her favorite of the 3 major animal attractions (Zoo, Animal Park, & Seaworld) in the San Diego area. Â I thought it enjoyable, but not necessarily my scene.The shows were entertaining, but cheesy. Â If you can get past the cheese, you'll be fine.Unlike Universal Studios' stingy all-you-can-eat pass which really limited you (only 3 of the restaurants, no drinks), Seaworld offered a AYCE pass for 24.95 (or something like that) which included drinks and most if not all of their eateries. Â Since I drink a lot, it really was a good deal. Â Plus the food here just seems better than at Universal Studios. Â The mesquite bbq was actually quite good."
2144,8/6/2012,4,"How can you not love Sea World?!?! Â This place is fun! Â Now I have to say up front, that Sea World isn't worth $80 admission for one day. Â However, it is worth it if you get a one year pass because of all of the perks. Â Living in L.A., its easy for me to come to SD and go to Sea World every month to hang out and take great pictures (starting a photography hobby). Â The prices for food are reasonable. Â I've only eaten at Ship Wreck Cafe and they have awesome choices of food. Â You can also buy a souvenir cup for $6 or so, however refill for it are 99 cents for the life of the cup. Â That means you can keep on bringing it back and get refills for a dollar. Â That's pretty rare for an amusement park. Â The shows are good. Â They usually keep the same shows for years so you'll see the same things over and over, however I never get tired of it. Â It's great for families and just a great place to spend a day at (again, if you have a season pass). Â It does get hot at Sea World. Â There aren't too many shaded places to sit at. Â But being in SD, the weather is fairly nice.Manta is not a 'fat' friendly ride, but hey I'm not complaining. Â It looks fun and my nieces said its a cool ride, so I'll take their word for it. Â I do wish that they changed the dolphin show. Â It seemed better a while back, however I love the other shows. Â My favorite is the Pets Rule show and Shamu's One Ocean."
2145,7/16/2012,3,"Seaworld is not as cool as I remembered it to be the first time I went. Â They only have about 10 rides here and 10 shows. Â The new ride Manta was pretty fun, so I recommend going on it. Â I watched the dolphin show and the sea lion show. Â Both were very entertaining, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Â Just dolphins swimming/jumping and sea lions balancing balls on their noses! Â However I think younger kids will probably enjoy seaworld very much! Â Definitely come here if you've never been!"
2146,8/20/2009,4,"I have been visiting Sea World since I was 5 years old and this place has always been a great amusement park. The place gets crowded on weekends, so a weekday is the best time to go. This is a family friendly, great park to visit."
2147,2/18/2012,4,"Sea World is nice. Â I'm just not sure about paying $75 for entry. Â That's almost the price of Disneyland! Â I'm going to see if they're going to release another buy 1 ticket and get the season free type of deal before dishing out this kind of money. Â They do offer quite a bit of exhibits and their shows are enjoyable. Â Truly good times for the kids, especially when they also have the Sesame Street play area."
2148,7/29/2010,4,This place is an all day event. I came here at 9am and didn't leave till night time. I loved watching all the show especially Shamu. There's not a lot of places where you can see a Killer Whale do tricks. The Cirque de la Mer show was very funny. The show starts off with two clowns splitting up and try to get the crowd to cheer for their side. Then later they have people do stunts and stuff. Another place that was pretty cool was the sea lion feeding area. You can buy 4 fish to feed them for 6 dollars but watch out! because there are birds around that will seriously take it from you if you get close enough. They'll just bite it out of your hand or take the whole tray. Day well spent.
2149,8/14/2012,3,Loved the shows and rides. The only bad thing was the food and their prices.
2150,7/6/2010,4,"Dear Shamu,My aunt and uncle took me to Sea World on a multi attraction vacation package a few summers ago. I loved your show (I made sure we sat in the front to get splashed but no one got hurt). We went on the Atlantis rollercoaster rides again & again (it was a week day and there were no lines). At the end-of-day Â I won the ring toss and a giant stuffed turtle. My aunt bought an annual pass but we didn't go back in time.I think Sea World deserves five stars (""best theme park ever!"").Love,- VT (age 7 at time of Sea World vacation)PS. My aunt says it's a bit expensive and there are so much more to see and do in the world than to return to Sea World every summer. My cousins are going this weekend. I'm sure they'll love it."
2151,12/2/2012,5,"Love love love this place!!!! My kids actually didn't care much for the Sesame Street area, which surprised me. I wasn't complaining though, since I'm not the most agile, and they're too young to run through a rope obstacle course alone, especially since I don't know what kind of other kids are going to be in there with them. The exhibits were great and enjoyable for the kids, but the shows were the real winners, hands down! I had to cut through the dolphin show to get somewhere after we had already seen it. We ended up staying and watching it a second time. And unlike a lot of other things that parents endure because their kids love it, and they love their kids, the shows were enjoyable for me, too. I probably had as much fun as they did!"
2152,9/2/2010,4,"I'm reviewing the Seaworld in general. i'll be reviewing the shows and exhibits separately. It's what i actually envisioned it to be. a park that's a wee bit similar to an aquarium but with shows and rides. looking at the map at first glance it seems confusing, but once you get used to the surroundings looking for the places you wanna go is quite easy. there are no shortages of exhibits and places to go. you can see fishes, sharks, penguins, dolphins, and whales. they even have pink flamingos. there are no shortages of places to eat although they are quite expensive. what park has cheap food anyways. there are restrooms adjacent in almost all of the show areas. the park was actually clean they did a good job and keeping it that way. only thing that was weird was they didn't have drop offs (not unless we missed the area) we had to be dropped off at the parking entrance and walk to the entrance. either than that i'll be coming back again, not next year but in 2 years i willShamu was a good show, you'll get lots of chances to take pictures of whales jump and splash into the water. although they got the whole bottom row labeled as splash zone it's really not true. the splashes only came up to almost 3/4 high up of the bottom row. to the side of the tank is non-existent -_- if you really wanna get wet then sit at the first 2 rows in the middle of the amphitheater.SeaLions Live is wacky and funny. this show was the most entertaining show we went to. in the beginning one of the shows host not only lip-syncs but does stand up also. the whole show is funny and mixes the tricks of the sea lions and the little otter.blue horizon's was mostly a people show. the dolphins in it are only shown about 1/4 of the whole show. not worth it to go if you wanna see dolphins in action. but if you wanna see high wire acts and dives then go see itwild arctic..kool ride but the screen sucks, it's old and blurry. would've been a cool ride the screen was a lot bigger and the picture more crisp.penguin encounter was kool. there are lots of penguins to take pictures off, some of them just stand still, some are swimming, the others are sleeping.shark encounter..geez i was disappointed with their exhibit. i wanna see more sharks and more upclose. you won't really to see them close until you go down the end of the exhibit and enter the moving walkway underneath a shark tankshipwreck rapids was a fun ride. i actually rode on a better ride like this before. but it's still is fun. not as bumpy as i wanted it to be. you will get soaked though. there's a waterfall towards the end of the ridejourney to atlantis is my favorite ride in this park. the immense excitement when you drop down and splash in the water. Â at the middle of the ride you come to a dead end thinking the ride is over but it's an elevator which tilts the ride sideways and the door opens and you soon drop to a series of twists and turns. I enjoyed this ride and will be my first destination next time around"
2153,2/20/2012,3,Worth it just because you can see a giant whale do front flips.
2154,12/13/2011,4,"My squadron arranged for a Christmas Party here and although skeptical at first I was impressed. I'm not a fan of amusement parks, for the first thing no one in attendance ever seems amused, everyone always seems like other guests at the park are in the way, or getting something that others are not. Whatever happened to having a smile, enjoying time with your family and having some common courtesy... but I'm off on a tangent again, sorry!The park offers beer which is a bonus, it's all Anheuser Bush products of course, but all in all they have some decent ones I'd rather drink craft brew but at least I can get a cold one here without being on a decades long waiting list for an ultra exclusive club inside the park (Disney Club 33).The food provided for the party was pretty good, hot dogs, fried chicken, BBQ chicken, salad, baked beans, fountain pepsi products, cakes, cookies, only thing would have made it better was coffee, as there was a slight chill in the air while we were there. We received a free snack coupon for later in the day but it was only good for certain items, popcorn, churro, an ice cream bar, one other I don't remember, would be better to be for a dollar amount and pay the difference or get something less expensive rather than be required to choose and item off of a very short specific list. Park employees don't have the flexibility to offer something less expensive, if it's not printed on the ticket you can't get it for free... Just saying it would make more sense "" good for any snack item valued up to $3.99 or $#.** patron pays the difference above set value"" that would offer more variety, but then more people would use the coupon and they wouldn't make the money off of those that do not.All in all Sea World is great! great things to see interactive and fun and there are some new attractions coming. maybe after they open we will be back.SlÃ¡inte!"
2155,6/4/2012,3,"My friend and I attended SeaWorld and had a great time, but the admission was ridiculous. Â We have complimentary passes so I am not complaining about that, but $73 for an adult admission ticket?! Â Are you kidding me? Â The shows were wonderful, but the I would not go back just for an afternoon for that admission cost. Â Also, the food/drinks were outrageous. Â We had two hot dogs and cotton candy for $20+. Â Fun experience, but not worth the $73 a ticket."
2156,8/12/2011,3,"i'm not sure if it was because i went on a weekend, but the line we had to wait in was RIDICULOUSLY long and had to wait like almost an hour. the ride itself was pretty fun and we all got soaked! you might wanna leave your cell phone or any other electronic things you might have with someone else who's not riding(if you can) or just bring a plastic bag for your stuff.but again, the line was crazy long and the ride itself is about 3 or 4 mins. at the most. NOT WORTH THE WAIT in my opinion. i'd ride it again, but only if the line isn't crazy."
2157,8/26/2013,3,"Sea world isn't as good as I remembered it. I haven't been here in over 10 years. The main issue was that the trainers weren't allowed to physically interact with the whales. That makes a huge difference as they only made hand gestures and blew their whistles for the whales to do tricks. Most of the shows were very short around 20 minutes. I really enjoyed the sea lion show especially the beginning where the guy was doing impersonations of famous singers. I also enjoyed the dolphin show because they could physically interact with them. The Cirque De La Mer was probably the most entertaining even though there were no animals. They had one guy from the audience participate in the show by going on the Jet ski with them and they put him in a huge inflatable ball and knocked him around the water with their jet skis. That was hilarious!The food was decent especially Mama Stella's. I really liked the barbecue chicken and the pepperoni pizza. The mozzarella salad was also very good. My girlfriend said we have to have the funnel cake which was soo good! We had it with chocolate and vanilla ice cream as well as strawberries. It came up to about $10 but fed four of us.They have a good amount of rides. There're great for kids but I recommend the roller coaster and the rapids.UPDATE:We have decided not to return to Sea World after hearing on the news about how they neglect their animals where the poor whale was stranded for almost 30 minutes. In addition, the movie ""Black Fish"" is another reason not to visit Sea World. I hope others follow this review to stop visiting Sea World."
2158,4/19/2014,2,I don't understand on a holiday how they let rafts on shipwreck rapids go empty. The line was not bad at all and we had an hour and twenty minute wait. 2-3 rafts would go out empty during this time. Get organized on your 50th anniversary.
2159,8/10/2011,1,Didn't like it. This Is gear for little kids 10 and under maybe. Â 2 rides and the rest is shows. Â My local zoo was better lol. Â If u wanna touch the dolphins it was extra money sucks. Â so we walk thru and left waste of money and 2.5 hour drive from palm springs Epic Fail!!!!
2160,5/4/2014,5,"My family has year passes and it is the best place to be on a weekday after school or weekend fun. Last I checked it was $89 bucks for adults about $79 for the kids for a single day pass but there are deals on year passes. The best deal on food $42.00 bucks for all day dine and drinks at the main restaurants in the park $39.00 bucks for the kids. Don't forget to stop by the arcade and play some winner every time games, I love watching the dolphins at dolphin point"
2161,9/15/2011,4,Havent been to Sea World since I was a kid. It has definitely changed for the positive. Great for families. Very relaxing and pleasant. Parking not too great. Lost my car for a good 30 minutes!
2162,10/4/2012,5,"Much better than I remember as a kid. Â Good mix of rides, shows, and Â activities. Kids are free in October. Â Park big enough to make it a two day all day trip plus if you want to do the zoo and wild animal park you can buy a 3 for 1 5 day pass at Costco and save some money."
2163,3/31/2012,4,"My boyfriend and I were in SD for the day and we decided to check out sea world. It was awesome but super expensive. 73 bucks for a day ticket, which I could've saved 20 bucks if i had my AAA card with me.... which i left in my other wallet... Oh well... It was fun, a lot of attractions and shows to go to. The Shamu show was amazing, those killer whales are so smart! It was such a great show, but it took forever to leave that stadium based on the amount of people they packed. Also, the dolphin show was really cool. Although we were sitting up in the stands between lots of little children and babies....that were constantly crying, shouting, turning around and poking us, which was kinda annoying. there are LOTS and LOTS of kids. Went to the bathroom, came out of the stall to moms and their little boys racing into the stalls, super moms yelling at their kids to wash their hands, diapers being changed, strollers, it was a mess. not the ideal place to be if you are in your 20s but oh well. I guess I experienced sea world san diego. it was fun, but just be aware that there are lots of children."
2164,10/3/2012,5,"I love SeaWord and so do my kids, no matter the age. Loved the new Manta ride! Next time I'm wearing my swimsuit, I refuse to get drenched and walk around soaking wet all day."
2165,9/1/2010,3,"When I was a kid, I loved Sea World. Â I was a science nerd - still am. But I have to mark down one star because of the price. $69 is a little pricey for what you get. Â But I still really recommend this place because there's many things to do and learn here.You can pet the sea animals: dolphins, sting rays, sea stars. You can watch shows that feature the sea creatures (and there's one with pets). And there are about 2 adult level rides.What I like about this place over Disneyland is that they sell beer and you can walk around with it. But the reason why they sell beer is the same as baseball games - BORING unless you're at least buzzed.It's expensive, and after every attraction, there is a store featuring a stuffed version of the animals you just saw. Expect to spend over $100 if you go because the ticket is expensive, plus the SkyTower and SkyRide are an extra $4, and the parking is $12. I haven't even mentioned the food!Atlantis is a fun ride, but confusing as hell. I think they tried to make a story go with it, but it made no sense. YOU WILL GET SOAKED. Also there are water cannons where someone can put 25 cents and blast anyone on the ride with water - NOT COOL.Blue Horizons is a new show they have. They should have called it BOO Horizons because it's a 20 minute show: 5 minutes of dolphins jumping, and 15 minutes of humans dressed in bird outfits doing flips and dives. NOT EVEN SEA CREATURE ACTION!!! DO NOT waste your time at Blue Horizons.I don't think I'll go back to Sea World again until I have kids to show it to. I'd rather go to Disneyland or Knotts and just pay the extra money it costs to go there.If you're with great friends and family, you'll end up finding a good time though - not because of the location, but because of the people."
2166,7/11/2009,3,"I have a love-hate relationship with SeaWorld.Believe it or not I had never been there until yesterday.Tourists just make me laugh and cry at the same time, so I had avoided that spot for a while.I saw a parade of the most interesting voyeuristic headwear, a few popped collars, and a lady wearing this weird fishnet type of dress.All ridiculous tourist-wear aside, I sort of enjoyed myself.They have this, pay for a day come back for the rest of 2009 deal, which makes sense for a San Diegan like myself (I probably won't go back any time soon. I get my ""Fun Card"" back and my SeaWorld name is ""Caludia"" great, wonder if I can find the overpriced mug with that name on one of their many souvenir stores.As for rides Journey to Atlantis got stuck in this part where my side of the cart was getting rained on from the waterfall. At some point we had to walk out because they weren't able to fix it, but we got readmission passes! No standing in line for this ride, ever!The employees looked depressed. I would be too if I worked in SeaWorld. They made me really hate myself for breathing their oxygen.During the Wild Arctic ride I nearly puked on the poor kid sitting next to me.I saw a man's handycam get pwned in the Shipwreck Rapids and it ensured plenty of lolz (did I just use ""pwned"" and ""lolz""?! Oh my)The shows were entertaining and depressing at the same time.Cirque de la Mer was like the lite watered down version of a Cirque du Soleil and Shamu Rocks was amusing but I also don't think Shamu enjoys being treated like a little bitch by the trainers who look like the Power Rangers. So when Shamu came by and splashed the shit out of me with its tail, I sighed and said, ""Very well Shamu, I DESERVED that. Now jump on and crush the drunk asshole screaming behind me with your glorious self!"""
2167,6/19/2012,3,"Its fun. I haven't been in a while, so it was ""new"" again. But the shows are the same ol' thing...and I am kinda always bummed for the animals being told to do tricks. I tend to not like the shows as much. I think the shark and turtle exhibits are great. I loved the rides (my daughter loves riding the Manta with me). Overall, I think it's fun. But it's not a place I go often."
2168,2/21/2013,4,"Seaworld was amazing, I went during the summer and got to watch the sealions, dolphin and shamu show. They were incredible, the soundtrack is really nice and the the shows were really good. There were so many rides, but extremely long lines... based on my experiences, Disneyland had shorter lines than here, but it is worth the wait. Â It was pretty pricey here. Getting soaked was incredibly fun, the Manta ride was actually a lot shorter than I had expected, especially when the line was really long. The 4D theater is amazing Â and the experience overall was a great trip. I would love to come back again, I can't wait!"
2169,2/7/2012,5,"You really don't need to read any reviews of Sea World. Â I mean, c'mon, it's Sea World. Â You pretty much know exactly what you get when you visit. Â Whale, dolphins, sharks, all the sea creatures you expect to see. Â If you are reading its review, you know no matter what anyone say, you are going to go. Â The shows were great. Â You get to see these animals do some pretty cool stuff and you wonder how do they teach them to do things like that. Â I expect the least from the Sea Lion show (comparing to whales and dolphins) and it turns out to be the funniest. Before the Whale show, they asked all service members to stand up and get recognized. Â That's pretty cool.My 4 year old was super excited and she had the greatest time. Â I wasn't rich, so I didn't get to eat lunch with shamu inside the restaurant. We walked by the side of the restaurant. Â Just us and like 4 other behind us. Â We were still close enough get the see the whale up close behind a window. Â  If it wasn't for the tall glasses, it was close enough for us to touch the side of the pool. Â The staffs who were showing the whales to the patrons inside gave the whale the command to come to our side a few times. The whale was so close, my 4 year old was super happy. Â That was really cool of what the staff did. And she had been bugging me to go back."
2170,7/22/2012,3,"This place is more for children, the best show was the Dolphin show so make sure you don't miss that if you go. At $73 per person I recommend a place like universal or even Disneyland."
2171,1/31/2007,4,"I had a very good time here with my fiancee on a weekend getaway. Â The exhibits were very well done, feeding the seals was a blast (watch out for the seagulls) and they had some decent eats where you could get some beers. Â We saw both the Shamu and the Dolphin show and the dolphins were much, much better. Â The Shamu show was so scripted it was kinda lame. Â The polar bear was fun to see, and just a fun time. Â Yes, its expensive, but still a great time for kids of all ages."
2172,11/20/2013,4,"Great park! But didn't meet expectations probably because of all the media hype. We saw 4 shows. It was great to see the dolphins and whales on display. However, it was hard to really appreciate them for what they are. It's a great place for glamour and to show off the marine life Â but lack materials for education."
2173,5/15/2012,5,"We had a wonderful time at SeaWorld. At first I really didn't want to go as I've been a long time ago when I was a child and didn't think it'd be all that great as a grown man. Man was I mistaken, they have improved all these shows so much. They were top notch. The Shamu show with the fireworks at 10 o'clock is a great finisher. The best part? The park doesn't close til 11 so we rode the Bayside Skyride until they closed and the Wild Arctic Ride was a blast along with the Shipwreck Rapids, complete with new shows like the Cirque de la Mer and be sure and ride the Skytower. Everything was a blast and there was time enough to do it all!"
2174,10/15/2009,5,"I love going here!!!! How can you not?!You get to see all sorts of aquatic animals/creatures and you can learn so much. I love it!You can pet all sorts of sea creatures, including DOLPHINS (and you can feed them too)!! The dolphins were fun to touch, so it's a must if you haven't.The shows are very entertaining, especially the Shamu show and Â sea lions show!The staff there are very friendly.Downside is that tickets are pretty expensive but I would definitely come back.It's a great place for your family or/and friends!"
2175,10/13/2010,5,"This is honestly the best place in the world.I go here every other weekend. (My family has 2 year passes).Anyone from ages 3-80 can enjoy Sea World.My favorite place at Sea World is Rocky Point Preserve. It's best to go early if you want to feed the dolphins. It's $6 for a tray of three fish. I believe the feeding times are 10:30 A.M and 12:00 P.M. Even if you miss the feeding times, it's still amazing to see the dolphins swim so close to you. Maybe if you're lucky one will come close enough for you to touch it. A show that's a MUST to see is Believe (The orca show) If you're sitting in the first few rows you WILL get soaked.The rides are great, the food is good but a little pricey, and the exhibits are amazing. Sea World is definitely a must for anyone that wants to see these amazing animals up close."
2176,6/10/2015,4,"Love Seaworld. I have loved Seaworld since I was a child, and even now as an adult I find it to be a great place to go if you leave in San Diego. I am a season pass holder and I probably go to Seaworld at least twice a month if not more. Its very educational, and I love seeing all the animals. Interacting with the rays or starfish is always fun. During the summer time they have what I think is the best show which is the Cirque De la mer show. Of course as with anything in California if you are visiting the tickets can be expensive, if you are a resident I would highly recommend a season pass. Food there is whats expected of these types of places, a little over prices and borderline decent. The rides are a blast. Its nice having the rides considering its not a ride based theme park. Snow world during the winter is fun. Its fake snow but its just a wonderful sight to see along with hearing the Christmas music and seeing all the lights."
2177,7/5/2012,3,"Does it even matter what an adult thinks about SeaWorld? This place. is. for. KIDS.And no problem with that at all. So either come here feeling like a kid, or with some kids, or else you will be upset. Outside of the dolphins and SHAMU, and some of the arctic exhibits there is not much else to see here. But even the dolphin show and the SHAMU may be enough value for admission. Seeing these sea mammals at work is something you will never forget. Food here is on par with other amusement parks. No thrilling rides to speak of.Overall: Go to see SHAMU and spend the day going for nice leisurely walk, with the spirit of being a kid again, or go with kids. Otherwise you might be better served going to the SD zoo."
2178,7/26/2012,4,"Spent a day here as part of my vacation trip to LA. Â Had a very enjoyable time with the family, doing the shows and the rides. Â The crowd wasn't too bad (at least by east coast standards). Â In comparing this park to its sister park in Orlando, I would have to vote for this one. Â (It was a b**tch having to drive back to LA at the end of that long day at the park.)"
2179,7/26/2012,3,"Went there for the weekend and it was fun. We were tired from the drive so as soon as we got there we went to the breakfast with the whales buffet. Was about $50 a piece. Pricey, but you get to relax and avoid all the heavy crowds. Got to see the whales from as close as 3 feet and the show was entertaining. After breakfast we proceeded to walk the park and catch some shows. The seal one was the best in my opinion. About 5 hours of beer drinking, cotton candy, and people watching we were exhausted. Â Went straight to the hotel for a nap."
2180,6/10/2010,2,"I am a huge fan of Sea World Orlando. Sea World San Diego? Not so much. The roller coasters were shut down. Shamu wasn't making anymore appearances (mind you this is around 1 pm). The only thing that I loved was the Shark Encounter. Holy hell, that was amazing.Petting the bat rays was cool. The seals were all making noise, it was great.But the park itself was lackluster. I was so unimpressed. I left the park feeling rather empty. Normally when I leave, I am left with a fulfillment. Yeah, not this time! It was kind of boring. It hurts me to say there.Attractions were lacking. It was overpriced for what they offered.I really expected a lot more. It was a bit outdated."
2181,5/1/2012,5,"If you haven't been in a few years, PLEASE try it again. There are many opportunities to get in at a discount and military gets in free once a year (day of your choice). Once in, appreciate the awesome rides that are included in the price. Atlantis is a full blown thrill ride. Although children as young as five can ride, I personally think it is too scary for kids that young. The animal exhibits are educational and fun. It you think it is wrong to view animal in captivity, then don't visit the park. That said, the animals seem happy and thriving. I was so happy with abundance of restrooms that all appeared clean and in good working order. The food was decent and even reasonably priced. I will be buying a silver pass soon."
2182,8/25/2011,1,"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR AN EASY PAY CARD WITH SEA WORLD UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE CHARGED INDEFINITELY! We bought ez-pay cards and regular passcards for our family last year in January. Once our year was up we tore up our cards and were done. HOWEVER SEA WORLD CONTINUED TO CHARGE US AND WILL NOT REFUND THE AMOUNT, even though we haven't visited the park in 8 months bcuz we knew we had fulfilled our 1 year obligation. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER PASSCARD FROM SEA WORLD AS THEY ARE MISLEADING AND WILL RIP YOU OFF AT THE FIRST CHANCE."
2183,4/29/2010,5,"LOVE this SeaWorld location. Parents, teens, and kids of all ages have something to do here.Parents/Young Adults: BEER SCHOOL. Need I say more? A partnership with Annheiser Busch (sp?) the makers of Budweiser, brings a beer school to SeaWorld where you can see the Budweiser horses and find out what makes them the ""King of Beers."" You learn the process of beer making and even do a sampling. Pregnant or underage? No problem, you can go through the school too, but you're marked ""not sampling.""Teens: Shows, water rides, and carnival-type games are sure to occupy your time if you're not into watching giant whales squeeze through little hoops.Kids: Too much stuff to mention, if your kid doesn't enjoy themselves, you might want to take them to a doctor to check their fun meter.Infants/Toddlers: Not only does SeaWorld offer baby/toddler food (Gerber stages 1 and up!) but their bathrooms are amazingly equipped with places to buy diapers, wipes, anything for your young child needs. They offer more than DISNEYLAND, no joke. Also, there are play areas designed for seperate age groups.. so have an infant barely learning to walk? There is an area surrounded with bumpers so that they don't get hurt. AWESOME.Food: Yum. A lot of variety, theme park price, but you get quality food. Definitely try the BBQ smokehouse they have goin on.Now that I write this, I want to go again HAHA."
2184,4/21/2012,3,"Teacher special...buy one fun card, get one free. Be prepared to bring full on documentation if you want one."
2185,12/3/2011,2,"Not at all like what it used to be! Â I know things change and am used to changes but the new Shamu show is just darm boring!!!!! Â The kids all seem antsy and they are not that entertained. Â I know they can't be in the water, we are used to that. Â Why did they get rid of the Shamu chant before the splash time? Â The new Dolphin show is way over the top weird..too much and I guess people wearing feathers are cheaper than animals. Â I watch the crowd because that is more entertaining than the show.Food is not that good, never really was. Â The employees are rude and not helpful. Â We are four year pass holders that are not renewing...so sad!"
2186,9/4/2009,4,"CROWDED AS HELL AND HOT AS HELL when I went. But it was a pretty fun place. I loved that show where they made believe some mother with her kid and husband were there and she fell off the bridge, etc. when she actually works there (they change families btw)."
2187,7/30/2012,4,Who doesn't love sea animals! What a treat it was to go there. I loved every minute i had to spend with Shamu! My family enjoyed the experience. They have a new water ride as well. They have a petting zoo that is so different compared to any where I have ever gone. You see sea creatures you have never seen before and are able to pet them. What a gift this place is. What an eye opening experience to take care of our ocean. I appreciate paying the high price to get in to it gives back to the sea animals and i firmly believe that. The staff are so talented and you can see there passion.
2188,3/17/2010,3,"This place was opened in 1964 and some of the displays seem like they haven't had much of an update since then. The penguin exhibit specifically seems trapped in some late-70's corny soundtrack hell. It also smells like it hasn't been cleaned since the late 70's so I guess that goes hand in hand.The best part of this park was honestly seeing the sea turtles-- I don't know that I've seen them anyplace else. I'm a big sucker for jellyfish-- they're one of my favorite underwater animals because they just don't seem like they should exist, but Sea World's display of them was pretty pathetic, especially compared to the monstrous tanks that hold jellyfish at the Long Beach and Monterey Aquariums.We visited the park on a weekday in February, about two weeks after the orca attack against a trainer. Subsequently, the Shamu ""Believe"" show was significantly dumbed down... no one got in the tank and swam with the whales and the trainers seemed to be feeding them their reward treats from well beyond arm's length. I understand that the attack just happened, but I paid $60 just to get in the gate-- I want some spectacle! Thankfully, our tickets were buy a day, get a day free, so we'll come back in the summertime and hopefully the Shamu show will be back to its full potential.I could comment on the politics of it-- blah blah blah there's too many dolphins in the dolphin tank (seriously, though, there were), obviously these animals aren't meant to be kept in tanks (the orcas here always die well before their wild life expectancies), live aquatic animal show theme parks are banned in most other developed countries worldwide, etc etc but this isn't necessarily the forum for that. There was no Great White in the Shark Encounter exhibit any more. WTF is up with that? I guess it died in 2004. What a bummer.The Atlantis ride was operating in spite of it being the off-season. You don't get very wet on this, so it's worth a trip. The dolphins here are really cool, too, and you can only see them outside the attraction.What you really should come here for, though, is the shows. Even the pet show is entertaining and impressive. We'll be back in the summer to catch the new dolphin show, the Cirque de la Mer, and the Shamu nighttime show. In the off-season, the entire park, shows included, can be finished off in about five hours. We arrived at 10 am and left at 3 pm, right after the weak Shamu show.Sea World is easily accessible by public transportation-- from the Old Town Depot, just take the Number 8 or 9 bus towards Mission Beach and it stops right at the front of the park. Lockers are available outside the park (and they're huge) for $1.50/use. Otherwise other lockers are available inside the park for $9 all day.This park isn't owned by Anheiser Busch any more, which I considered a major bummer-- nothing like a free beer tasting to liven up a trip to a theme park!! Instead they offer a beer flight with cheese and crackers for like $9.25 inside the old hospitality center.In the future, I probably won't be back here. I'll stick to the great aquariums California has to offer instead, but this is a fun, albeit expensive, way to spend a day in San Diego."
2189,6/4/2008,3,"I think I'm getting too old for these kind of amusement parks. Â The shamu show was too kiddy for me and I wish I had some little kids with me to substantiate why I was watching it in the first place. Â I did enough the dolphin show though. Â They are such intelligent creatures and very cute! Â Someday I will have to have some close up interaction with them. I went on a Saturday during midday and I only stayed about 3 and half hours, before I was done. Â I went to 80% of the exhibits and saw two shows in that time (dophin and shamu show). Â If you were bringing kids, I could imagine this place being an all day trip. Â I, too, did not know Anheuser Busch owned it and that was very interesting to see all their advertising around the place. Â With the 2 for 1 pass, I could come again, and I think I will come in the late afternoon so I can see the fireworks show."
2190,9/22/2008,5,"My BF and I came here on a Sunday. Admission at the gate is for an adult is currently 61 bucks. They also have a promotion or something going on, which I'm not sure how long it'll last, but for 61 bucks, you get to go back for a second time by the end of the year for free. This is great since I really don't believe you can do EVERYTHING at SeaWorld all in one day, and I think its worth it to see the shows a second time. In one day, from 1030am-630pm, my BF and I saw every exihibit and saw every show except for Cirque de la Mer, Sesame Street, and the one about pets. We also didnt get a chance to get on any rides. What I definitely recommend is participating in ther Dophin Interactive Program. It costs about $170/person (not including admission), but you get a chance to get in the water with the dophins, do tricks with them, feed them, and touch them. Dolphins are sooo smart and are really breathtakingly beautiful creatures. Unfortuntely, you don't get to swim with them, but you get some great photos with the dolphins. For the price, all you have to do is bring a bathing suit, because boots and wetsuits are provided. After the dolphin interaction, hot showers, blow dryer, towels, shampoo/conditioner, and body wash is also provided to wash off the salty water. If I go back again, I would bring other toiletries and products with me like Q-tips, hair tie, face wash, and make-up!"
2191,3/9/2012,4,"I love the fact this place has a military appreciation. Without even having to go anywhere to get a ticket I walked up with my military ID and got in for free. My mom came with me and she got a 50% discount because of me. Also, don't forget... you can also do fun things to add to your day like doing the penguin adventure or another behind the scenes tour. Some are fairly cheap and others you'll pay a lot for the tour and some do fill up quick, so be on the lookout for what's available. The roller coaster ride isn't too bad. Last time I went though they had quite a few areas shut down for remodeling which did kind of suck they're usually pretty good about fixing it promptly."
2192,4/1/2010,5,"I lucked out and was gifted to a (year) Fun Card to San Diego Sea World. I didn't think I would use it much as none of my friends have one. However a girlfriend came into town with money to burn and seeing as Sea World had just extended it's hours for the summer, we hopped on over when I was done with work Tuesday night. I had so much fun! I have already seen all the exhibits and shows and after my friend and I watched Pets Rule (my fave) we pretty much rode the rides the rest of the night. This week Sea World was not very busy and we rode the Atlantis 2 times in a row, took a break to go up in the Sky Tower then rode the Raging Rapids twice (didn't even have to get off the ride in between). After grabbing some hot drinks (it gets chilly at night after going through water rides) I was convinced to go back to the Atlantis. My friend didn't care to see the Shamu show again so we decided to ride the Atlantis till the park closed. We got 4 more rides out of and ALMOST beat those kids by number of times ridden that day. I gotta tell you, going on a roller coaster while fireworks erupt in front of you is one of the most awesome things ever!!Did I mention we are both in our mid-twenties?"
2193,4/14/2008,4,"We just came back from a great time at Sea World. Â We went there a few years ago, when our kids were 1 and 3, and didn't find it as good for that age, but at 3 and 6 it worked much better. Â The kids enjoyed the shows, and especially the interactive exhibits, petting and feeding bat rays and dolphins was really fun. Â I was disappointed that they hadn't changed the dolphin show since the last time we were there. Â But the new Shamu show was exciting for the kids. Â I enjoyed seeing the joy and wonder on my son's face as he was watching.The food at Sea World could really use improvement though. Â My husband pointed out that they are owned by a beer company, and it seems like the only food they sell is ""beer food."" Â Not great."
2194,9/14/2009,4,"I absolutely love going to amusement parks and Sea World has always delivered. The staff is always nice and welcoming... bathrooms and park is clean... the shows are usually 30-45 mins... the rides are TONS of fun... you get a lot of food at the restaurants... etc. I guess the only thing about Sea World is that it is a little pricey... I believe its $60 per person, but you never have to pay for anything else except food. But what is really nice about Sea World is that there is something at every corner--this is not a park where you walk around a lot looking for attractions. Oh! And if you sit in the soak zone at Shamu and the Dolphin shows you will only get soaked if you are in the first 3 rows... I guess I can't really vouch for that--but every time that I have sat up just a couple more rows, I only get a little drizzle to cool me off :)"
2195,6/26/2013,4,"This place is not what it used to be. Â Prior to this time (April 2013), the last time I came here was with my dad about 10 years ago. Â It was so much fun, and the whales did some really amazing tricks. Â Ten years and a couple whale-related deaths later, I don't know if I could praise it as much as I used to. Â The otter show was very funny, the dolphin show was really entertaining (they even had acrobatics-type people doing stunts during the show!), and the rides were fun. Â The Shamu show was the only thing that left more to be desired but for good reason. Â The first Shamu showing we went to, my dad and I were left wondering what happened and why the only thing Shamu did was splash people and do a couple belly flops. Â They were no longer throwing the trainers in the air or doing double somersaults at the same time. Â If you're not in the know, there were a couple trainers that died from killer whale attacks. Â As a result, trainers are no longer allowed to force the whales to do tricks. Â Apparently, it looked like they were no longer allowed to do tricks with human trainers anymore either. Â After watching the Shamu Nighttime Rock and Roll Show, I came to the conclusion that the whales are now limited in the tricks they can perform, which is a good thing and great for the animals to prevent any abuse or mistreatment, but my dad and I weren't expecting that so our reaction to the Shamu show 10 years later, was one of confusion. Â The whales did do a great job though, and they did a wonderful job of splashing the audience with water. Â Overall, a great experience, especially for kids!"
2196,8/4/2008,3,"Honestly, what can you really say about Sea World? Â It's perfectly fine...there's nothing really wrong with it, but it's definitely not number 1 on my must-visit list. Â It's really more like...a marine animal zoo or an aquarium than a theme park, but I suppose they do have some rides and different shows.Speaking of shows, we caught Shamu: Believe, which wasn't quite as exciting as I had hoped (and quite cheesy), and that other show about seals and sea lions, which was moderately amusing.Ticket prices seem INSANELY high to me and food is very expensive at the restaurants as well. Â And oh yeah, do you want a straw in your soda? Â Oh well, guess what? Â You have to pay for it!On the plus side, they have a ton of SEA TURTLES (!!!), which are my favorite animal ever. Â It takes a bit to find where exactly they're located, but it's worth it. Â The open area where you can touch the bat rays is a pretty cool spot too; my brother liked it a lot.The skyride across the bay is also really nice, despite it's shortness and cost.Overall this place is fine, I suppose...but I don't think it's worth the hefty price you pay to get in."
2197,6/5/2011,2,"If you've been to SeaWorld Orlando, expect to be disappointed. It's much smaller and the (very) small selection of rides aren't even that well done. The glass on all their exhibits is very clean, and their many underwater exhibits are perfectly aquascaped! However captive bred their marine mammals may be (ie. the bottlenose dolphins), no one can deny that their tanks are WAY TOO SMALL. Three adult belugas, one baby, and a few commersons dolphins all crammed into one tiny tank makes for great viewing, but poor ethics! Their shows are entertaining, but the booths are tacky. These whales and dolphins are way too intelligent to be in captivity. If you really want to support their conservation efforts, don't go to Sea World."
2198,2/12/2009,4,"Love this place. I went on a Sunday morning and found a great parking spot. Was bummed out that the underground penguin exhibit was closed, but they do give you fair warning before you pay for parking and tickets. Went on a first date here and it was a great place to stroll around and drink a few beers.Very clean place. Fun rollercoaster, but it scared the hell out of me. I like this place because you can go here and actually enjoy it even if you don't have kids.Would like to take my little boy there when he's a bit older."
2199,12/3/2009,4,"Always a good time. My 2 yr old loved the Shamu show so much that he was clapping over and over. And they're not kidding about the splash zone. I was at the top of the splash zone thinking I wouldn't get hit. But of course one of the whales splashed his tail in my direction. There's nothing like starting off your Seaworld adventure being soaked with salt water. The video boards in the Shamu stadium are pretty cool -- four separate video screens that can rotate and join together to form one massive screen.Some of the other exhibits weren't as cool, but overall it's a good time for everyone."
2200,6/15/2012,4,"we had a great time, but I thought it would have been a bit bigger.the shows were all great and the animals were all awesome.I loved the beluga whales they were very beautiful.we saw the whole thing and all the shows in one day.there are not many rides and most of them are water rides with the weather barley reaching 65 the week we went Â we didnt do the water rides, but everything else was really nice"
2201,8/20/2012,2,Something to catch once if you have the chance but as far as multiple visits you're better off with an amusement park or Â the zoo. I was just very disappointed in the customer service aspect . I signed up two be a 2 year member which was fine but after the two years were up you automatically get signed up to be a month to month member . I called on the same day I was charged for the additional month and Customer Service told me to pound sand . I mean come on . You would think they'd understand a little honey attracts more bees. I've seen enough orca's and sea lions for free. Might as well renew my SD Zoo membership. More to see and a lot more accommodating.
2202,1/15/2008,4,"There isn't a whole lot to do here, which is probably why a one day admission will get you in for an entire year for free. But its so cool to be able to have a day off of work, go to a daytime Padres games during the summer, and go to Seaworld right after. Or better yet, go to Seaworld during the day, and then go clubbing Downtown afterwards =)I'm a big fan of marine life, so I don't get tired of seeing Shamu or watching the penguins. And their 3 rides aren't that bad either"
2203,12/21/2008,5,"Like the other great animal attraction in town (The San Diego Zoo), this is a must-see. Â This is a great park, and for the uniqueness of the experience of going, I think it's worth the money they ask in the end (plus I fancy it's for animal food and care).My personal favourites are the petting tanks, as they give you an opportunity to experience some animals close up. Â And the shark encounter is pretty cool too. Â I actually have swum that close to sharks...but not sharks that large or scary. Â And the perennial classic is the Shamu show....which I've recently come to find kind of creepy...like Orcas are all cute at Sea World...and then you realise they can kill sharks, are smarter than most things in the water, and rend and tear seals (read looks WAY too much like a person in a wet suit). Â In the end, you should go...maybe everyone should. Â Species disappear every year...I think places like Sea World help us remember we're part of something bigger than ourselves."
2204,4/1/2009,5,First of all we as a family have year passes which makes it pretty convenient that whenever we are bored and looking for something to do we pack up the kids and a cooler and go. We like to pack a cooler for lunches and beverages. Right outside the park by the entrance to the left there are some benches that make this very convenient or we just sit in the air conditioned car if it's a hot day. That saves us money when necessary but when we feel like splurging a bit we like to dine at the shipwreck cafe where we choose to sit either by the ride to watch all the passengers get soaked or by the stage if there's a live show/presentation going on. There are plenty enough shows and rides to check out without your kids getting too bored. My boys (a baby & a 7yr old) like to play in the Sesame Street's Bay of Play while my nieces enjoy spending some of their allowance in the arcade.During the summer & holidays we love watching the new shows that they have for Shamu as well as all over the park day and night. Great place to go over and over again with the kids.
2205,6/5/2012,5,"We have a season pass to Sea World, and we love it! The passes are way worth it. The shows are great and Â they just opened up the new Manta exhibit which is really fun! They have made alot of changes lately and I do think they are all for the better!"
2206,6/6/2010,5,"Sea World is awesome!!! Â We have been pass holders for years. Â I can't wait to see the blue horizons show! Â I hear it's really good! Â Food: We are also pass holders at Disneyland too. Â We love Disney, but the food is much better at Sea World! Â Sea World also offers something that I wish Disney would: Eat all day long for $29 per person. Â I'm not really surprised with the price like some people on here. It's a theme park! Â When was the last time you went to 6 flags, knots, disney, or where ever & bought a soda for $1? Â Loosen up the purse strings a little bit."
2207,4/19/2012,4,I saw Shamu. Sea Turtles too! It was sunny so it was cool. lol
2208,3/29/2010,4,"I finally went to Sea World today! I came here around 9:30 with exceptional parking. The first place my girlfriend and I went to was the Wild Arctic. The helicopter simulation ride was NOT the best. It was outdated and each time the helicopter dipped it made me feel like yacking. I thought I was still young enough to handle these rides, but I guess these simulation rides need to go!Shamu's Believe show was good, but which was is the ""real"" Shamu? There was four killer whales, two big ones, and two babies. I guess Shamu is any Sea Worlds ""killer whale"". Overall the show was entertaining.I thought Sea Lion's Live was really good! They mocked a few popular shows such as American Idol. The skits the performers and the sea lions were also entertaining. I'm surprised I enjoyed it.Sesame Street 4D seems more of a plug-in at Sea World because it did not really match any of the ""wild life"" Sea World offers. Other than that, the 4D show was actually pretty entertaining. There were a few scenes when you will get wet.The other attractions at Sea World was good, but the thought about animals being held captive does not rock my boat. I actually feel bad for the killer whales and sea lions who perform daily tricks just so they can have their daily meals. It is really sad! I hope what Sea World says about taking care of the animals is true because I along with others believe animals should live happily.I stayed at Sea World until around 3, so roughly 6 hours. The park is not exceptionally large, but there is enough to do to fullfill a days worth of fun. Luckily I have the CityPass which included Sea World. If it was not for the CityPass, I don't think I would have paid the $70-80 admission ticket. Who would pay more money to feed animals? They are more than happy to sell you a fish or two to feed their animals so they don't have to do their jobs. Other than animals being held captive, Sea World is a fun place for everybody, especially for little children."
2209,8/5/2012,2,"If you or a member of your party has food allergies (ours are nut allergies) then bring your own food because Sea World is not an allergy tolerant park. Â We had the worst experience trying to get food and dealt with some attitude from park employees about it. Â We have visited Sea World a dozen times (until now all before the allergy diagnosis) and will never go back. Â We can't. Â My childs life is not worth the visit. Also, I sent an email outlining my concerns (because it's absolutely impossible to get someone on the phone) and never heard a word back from anyone. Â Nothing, not a word.......The dolphin show is still awesome. Â Shamu shows were very boring but I get the trainers safety is a concern. Â The new Manta ride was average."
2210,3/3/2008,4,"It was a very well-rounded place with a variety of activities to keep you interested. No doubt, there was the Shamu/dolphin shows, but on top of that, there are sea animals exhibitis, roller coaster rides, arcades, and carnival games. I thought one of the added benefits was the beautiful plants grown all throughout the part. There were regular to exotic plants from around the world. The park had signs with description and name of the plants. A good learning experience and a feast for the eyes!My little cousins loved the place because they didn't get bored with us one activity. They especially loved the fact that they got wet through the roller rides. One downside: Each exhibit was fairly small. Not too many sea animals or fish to see. For those who live in the bay area and can't make it down to San Diego anytime soon, you should consider checking out the Monterey Bay Aquarium instead. Smaller setting, majority indoors but a lot more animals to see. Overall, Sea World was a good experience. Great place for kids!"
2211,8/29/2008,5,"You can't visit San Diego and not visit Seaworld. Â This is a spectacular park, especially the sharks, arctic and manatees exhibits. Â Their big attractions are the whale and dolphin shows, which are nice, but I would highly recommend watching the night time shows over the daytime ones. Â They are much better.If you are going to be at the park all day you might want to get their food pass. It's a decent deal for 2-3 meals. You won't get out of there for less than $20/person for 1 meal anyway and that's while watching your spending. Â I suggest Shipwreck Cafe. They seemed to have more options."
2212,4/8/2009,3,"3.5 stars. I enjoy the shows, but I feel the need to sell unnecessary merchandise prior/during the shows to be a bit much. Light sabers??? (Really now?...how is this remotely related to the park???) Food here is very expensive and they check your bags before they scan your ticket. (I'd recommend eating before (or hide the food!) Suggestion:If you plan to stay there all day, you can leave the park (eat somewhere else) and come back later that day. Parking is 12 bucks!They do offer a fireworks show during various nights (check online)....and the night shows are fun to watch."
2213,7/22/2009,4,"I love Sea World. Â I came back because it was part of my Southern California City Pass. Â I remember coming here as a kid and getting bit by a dolphin. Â A lot has changed though. Â I remember the dolphin cove and being able to by a small tray of fish to feed the dolphins. Â They don't do that now. Â It's more like $45 to experience being that close to a dolphin. Â It was HOT when we were there. Â The rides and attractions, I don't remember them as a kid but the wait times for them were ridiculous: 45 for Journey To Atlantis? Â I'm straight. Â One plus side about Sea World is you can by a wrist band for $29/adult and $19/child and you can eat all you can at most of the eateries around the park. Â Needless to say, we made it a point to stop at everyone of them and get all the entrees. Â I had to get my monies worth, and boy did we ever! ;-)On the educational side, my inner nerd loved the exhibits. Â The tide pool was cool but the host there, MELANIE, didn't even stop to regulate on the guests who couldn't f'n read, ""DO NOT TAKE ANIMALS OUT OF THE WATER"" that was so blatantly placed in front of them. Â She would be so fired. Â  Â I would definitely go back again with the fam!"
2214,10/4/2009,5,"LOVE seaworld, there is so much to see and so much to do! Highly reccomend the 2 day pass so you can take your time! fun!We also did dine with shamu for dinner and I highly recoomend it! the food not so good but you really are not paying for the food the experience is so much fun!"
2215,10/26/2009,4,"Bought my tickets online and saved 10 dollars for 2 day pass. I enjoyed seeing all the marine animals, riding the rides, and the Shamu Show ""Believe"" was cool to watch, even though the music playing while they peformed was a little corny. Â haha Â If you love marine animals and/or seeing your kids have a blast, you will definitely enjoy this place."
2216,12/5/2009,3,"Eh, this place is pretty average. Â Sea World tries to be an amusement park and an aquarium, but it doesn't do either perfectly (although it's much better as an aquarium than park). Â There are basically 3 rides: a decent roller coaster, a sub-par roaring rapids style ride, and a really lame movie-plays-while-your-seats-move-around-to-give-you-the-sense-of-motion ride. Â So don't come here expecting any kind of trilling amusement park experience.The rest of the park is basically an outdoors aquarium, with dolphins, otters, sharks, and, of course, the famous killer whales. Â There are a few interesting shows (the Shamu show is a must-see, naturally) but overall this place is just really small. Â We were basically done with everything in the park in about 6 hours, and then had to sit around for a few hours waiting for the night time Shamu show to start.So, as an amusement park, this place fails miserably, especially compared to some place like Disneyland or Six Flags. Â As an aquarium, it's slightly above average (factoring in the shows) but doesn't compete with a place like Monteray Bay aquarium (except for the large animals, like the dolphins and sharks).Considering the fairly steep price, I can't really recommend it unless you just absolutely love marine life.Oh, and be sure to visit the most exotic marine life of all, the Budweiser clydsdales (buh?)"
2217,1/6/2010,4,"Sea World has a lot things to see and do. You shouldn't miss Shamu, the Penguin exhibit, or the Dolphin Encounter. I wish we had been able to go to the Dolphin show but they only had one showing and we were waiting in line. Bring snacks.. the food lines are crazy.Also, the park is about $69 a person.. but if you're Â a Southwest Rapid Rewards member(you can always sign up and use the temporary card). you get 20% off admission."
2218,4/10/2012,4,SeaWorld isn't the most exciting place in the world but it makes the wife and kids happy so thats all Â that matters to me.
2219,7/26/2014,4,Wonderful place if you earn enough. Food super puper Â expensive. Â Soooo many people. Overall great experience.
2220,7/25/2012,4,"We bought tickets online at 53 dollars a piece and thought that was awesome value for money. There is so much to do, we could not manage everything. On the down side the wait lines for rides are too long (average 45 mins to an hour), and staff dont seem to be good at filling up every ride properly (that would reduce wait times considerably). However, we saw all the shows and loved them, although for many the focus is more on pure entertainment than the animals themselves. Still a Â great day out."
2221,11/24/2010,1,"My advice is, if you want to see marine creatures, go to Birch Aquarium. Â Sea World should be called People World. Â There are fewer and fewer critters and more and more rides and games. Â Now there is a huge roller coaster that takes half the venue. Â It is incredibly expensive, and the shows are at the five-year-old level, really, really silly. Â Half of the so-called dophin show is mostly people plopping in the water. Â If you go, don't eat there. Â Get your hand stamped, go someplace else and come back."
2222,3/26/2012,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!The tickets, I saw, were really expensive, but that didn't stop us! My boyfriend and I came here as my early birthday celebration. And it was also my first time here and I'm 23. I love love LOOOVVEE this place. I love it more than Disneyland! They had so many animals, I thought I was going to miss out on some of them but I didn't! We planned out day when we got there and somehow we got to see ALL the shows and ALL the animals! And we got some time left over to go on Journey to Atlantis (we were a bit soaked), to play a game (he won me a Shamu doll), and to go shopping for a bit (he bought me a harp seal). We were prepared and had breakfast on the way to Sea world and when we got there, we bought the funnel cake and shared it. The funnel cake was AMAZING. Fresh strawberries, ice cream, and the cake itself! It was so yummy. I can't wait to go back and eat that again. I also wanted the Shamu souvenir cup because 1)refills were only $1 and 2) Shamu cup looked way better than the dolphins cup and 3)We were getting thirsty and he wanted soda instead of the water I brought from home -_-.We also got the feed the sea lions. It was a bit expensive $7 for, I think, 5-7 pieces of fish, but it was fun! And feeding them just once is more than enough. It was fun watching them bark at you and then wait for you to toss the drop at them and they will go the distance for it.In any case, this place is amazing. I love Sea World. The shows were amazing and I was surprised that it wasn't crowded. We went on a friday and it was during my spring break which is a lot different than the k-12 system of spring break so we didn't really get caught up in the crowds. I think that is what made a difference. In any case, if we do come back (and we will!) it would have to be during a time when the college system is on spring break and k-12 aren't on their spring break yet just to avoid the crowds.Oh! And in Spring 2012, there is going to be a new ride called Manta! But I'm there more for the animals than rides. However, I'm sure there will be a lot of people who are and will be excited for the new ride coming spring 2012."
2223,5/29/2007,3,"Sea World is great if you have never been before. Â Everyone should go once. Â After that.... what's the point?I avoid Sea World at all costs, I try to get my guests to do other things, but if they insist on going, I tell them that they need a day alone as a family and to enjoy Sea World with just their family.Usually they come back, not impressed and upset with the cost to get in and to even have a snack.My youngest does love the penguin and shark encounters... but as my children get older, they really don't want to go.Sea World does a lot for animals and that's a good thing. Â So I gave it three stars for that reason and that everyone should go once. Â I just wouldn't waste my money to go a second time."
2224,2/18/2008,4,"Hello! For all you people who didn't have fun at Sea World you obviously ran past the Hospitality Center. FREE BEER SAMPLES.Want more FREE BEER... stroll on over to BEER SCHOOL and get 4 full sized free beers!!!! You may have to wait 15 minutes... but it's totally worth it. Â They let you pick 4 Anheuser-Busch beverages, waiter brings them out one at a time, tells you about the beverage and also brings out a plate of fruit, cheese, cracker and Ghirdelli chocolates!!!After you have had your fill of free alcohol the sea lions are a lot more fun!If a sea gull steals your churo, they'll replace it for free."
2225,8/22/2008,3,"I think if I was younger and had no real inclination of what a $60 admission ticket means in real life I would have liked this place a lot more. Given that fact, I am probably coming from the wrong view point to begin with but I feel like it really was not worth the cost of admission. Their Cirque De Soleil rip-off was OKay but had no real build up, emotion, humor, intellect, or gravitas. The story line was just an excuse for the clowns and acrobats to do some tricks and the production all just seemed so second rate and uninspired. The dolphin show was cool, but it was also like any other dolphin show I have ever seen with nothing that would make it stand out. Maybe if we were sitting in the 12 first rows designated as a splash zone we would have liked it more.The rapids ride broke down for 40 minutes while we waited in the hot sun.The one good thing that came out of it was learning what a Commissers dolphin is."
2226,12/22/2008,4,"I don't know what it is about large fish and amoeba-shaped mammals (i.e., seals & otters) that get kids so excited, but hey - it works. Â And when you just want to entertain the little ones, Sea World totally delivers.I'm not going to try to re-invent the wheel here, since most people have said what I would say, but I will add that my 3-year old has nothing to complain about when it comes to this place. Â There is a fantastic variety of live shows, displays, and she LOVES the Bay of Play. Â I only gave it 4 stars because, unlike the zoo, the parking is not free. Â Also, tickets are damn expensive, unless you were smart and took advantage of their passport offer - buy a whole year's admission for a little more than the price of one day's admission! Â AWESOME."
2227,5/24/2009,4,"I have had Sea World Platinum passes for the past 4 years. We get so much use out of them too. I love the holiday special event that passport holders are invited to and they cute ornament they give out each year. My daughters and I love the Sealions Tonight show. It is the funniest show and by far our favorite! Make sure to buy a sea world collectible cup with lid and straw. As the cups they serve at the establishments are not allowed to have lids and straws for the animals safety. Also refills are much less expensive on the collectible cup! When we want to get a relatively hassle free lunch/dinner at Sea World we always opt for our favorite eating spot ""Calypso Bay"". If you go while a Shamu show is going on you will miss big lines since everyone wants to check out Shamu. But really we have learned that the Shamu show is the least exciting one there. I almost rather sit through the creepy acrobat show."
2228,11/29/2009,3,"We went to Seaworld with great expectation. But we were disappointed, as we thought the place is over-hyped.The Shamu show was really great. But thats all. All other things were not great. Aquariums were very small. Have been to Monterrey (CA), this looked like a small place.Options for eating were very limited. As we had been to Disneyland and Universal Studios, we were disappointed with eating options here.I would prefer going again to Disneyland or Universal Studios rather than coming so far."
2229,4/12/2012,2,"Bring a big wallet and a lot of patience. The cost for an adult to get in is 73$ a bit pricey if you ask me. They offer a 30$ meal plan , for the 30 bucks you can eat all day. they also offer 2 different fast pass tickets. this gives you better seating at shows. the only ride is a tram across a bay like area. it was a nice break from walking. Â Personally I think the San Diego Zoo is a much better deal and has more to see, the park map is hard to follow and everything is crowded and tight. I wouldn't suggest going here. Save your money and see the zoo instead.We went on April 9th 2012"
2230,7/6/2009,3,"Going to Sea World on July 3rd probably wasn't the best idea i've had. Â It was crazy crowded. Â I've gone to Six Flags Marine World and several other amusement parks, so I had a general idea of what Sea World would be like. Â Anyways, it's your typical day at an over-crowded amusement park. Â Everything is overpriced and tons of things for your kids to want, everywhere you look. Â We went to the Sea Lion and Otter show and the Dolphin show. Â The Sea Lion show, kicked the Dolphin show's a**. Â The sea lions were pretty funny, and their tricks were pretty cool. Â The dolphins at Marine World do a much bettter job with tricks and performance. Â Maybe the dolphins at Sea World are overworked and underpaid... they do do shows every hour all day long. Â My 3 year old had a great time in the Sesame Street play area. Â We ate at a little mexican spot next to the Otter and Sea Lion show. Â It was pretty good... We had the fajita salads.. It came topped with a huge piece of steak... Pretty good for amusement park food. Â My tip is to bring in a backpack with bottled waters, helps save a little money, and is very convenient!"
2231,7/25/2009,4,"The killer whale and sea otter shows were good. Â However, what surprised us all is the Elmo Sesame Street theatre was the funnest of all!I won't spoil the surprise for you. Â Just go. Â It's not your normal 3D movie...they call it the 4D theatre for a reason.We've been to the Shamu, dolphin, and sea otter shows before. Â We actually like the sea otter show the most. Â It has a sorta of Beach Blanket Babylon (San Francisco reference) touch to it, where a lot of current adult pop culture is mixed into the show in between silly antics for the kiddies.OK Seaworld management, listen up. Â The strollers suck! Â I suggest you go to Legoland or San Diego Zoo to see how proper strollers should be. Â Yours is insanely hard to turn or start moving. Â I need to take running jumps to get enough inertia. Â Practically have to do math to calculate F=MA to move that thing. Â Plus, your stroller costs more to rent by $6. Â Thus the 4 stars. Â Otherwise, great job on the shows!"
2232,8/8/2009,4,"My lady was in town for the 4th of July holiday weekend and she wanted to see Shamu so off to SeaWorld. They have a great deal online where you can get adult tickets at kids price and second free visit. Great for us because we like to sleep in and got to the park later. Our first day was on a Friday and we saw half of the park and most of the shows. We then returned later in the weekend to see the rest of the park. Not a bad deal and we didn't feel like we had to rush through the park in one day. The shows, although short, are entertaining. There's not much as far as rides but the animal exhibits are pretty decent."
2233,8/17/2009,3,"Seaworld. I have to admit I'm not a big theme park person, so I always come somewhat negative. BUT! Seaworld is great because I love the sea, fish, dolphins, sting reys, and whales. I caught (3) shows: Shamu and the killer wales, dolphins, and Cirque de la Mar. The last one just makes me want to go to Vegas and see a Cirque de Soleil show, such a tease for the real thing!On a serious note, the bathrooms were extremely nasty. Small, smelly, and full of thousands of crazy children. On a positive note, they serve beer in Seaworld. BEER.xxx C"
2234,1/1/2011,2,"Had a good time here with my nephews for new years. One thing that was disappointing is that the trainers aren't allowed in the pool with shamu any longer. Food was very disappointing here also. Everything is marked up too high, bring your own snacks. They would get more stars if the food want so marked up."
2235,2/6/2012,3,"Its not as good as it used to be. I ve been a sea world lover and my visit on saturday converted me...The shows are not as spectacular anymore..Shamu- i kept waiting for moredolphin- where did all the acrobatics come from. totally not needed...they should rename the show as acrobatics and dolphins....come on this is supposed to be sea world not acrobatics world...sea lion- okay donkeyHalf the rides are closed. Lots of construction. the aquariums are not maintained well anymore . u can clearly make out all the filth on the glass.One thing Â i ve always disliked is a general lack of benches for seating..Agree there a lot of food stalls, but where do u sit n eat ...They have a lot to learn from DL..."
2236,8/9/2011,5,"Awesome time with my family....I MISS THE MANATEES but I must say Turtle Reef is pretty cool. Disappointed that the Stingrays petting area is closed too....lots of changes. Like the Shamu show....hmmmm...I liked the old show better but I guess for safety reasons no more trainers in the water but the whales still put on a ""splash"" of a show and to see the smiles on the little ones faces....PRICELESS."
2237,6/10/2012,3,Shows were very good and put together well. Get ready to spend some money. Place was very clean and any staff was helpful and not rude.
2238,8/6/2010,3,"They charge you for the kennel, not in Legoland but here yes, they don't give you a key for your kennel, has to call them every time that you check your dog, and once they opened the kennel, I asked them how do they know that I was the owner and the guy told me, if the dog goes with you, then I know, I told them that please ask for paper, don't rely in dogs, mine is always friendly and goes with everyone!!!!!!!"
2239,10/31/2010,1,"Rating for the Shamu Show Believe.This show highlights some very expensive LCDs screens, from the start time of the show watch a couple of commercials, watch a facebook ad, watch Believe intro. So far 8 minutes watching TV of a 25 minutes show. Now a jump... back to watching TV. Another 3 minutes pass, now you get to see some interactions, live on TV3 minutes of killer whales jumping and LCD TV screens spinning.Back to the TVs only20 minutes in and the trainings say something and the crowd wakes up with a splash from Shamu, available live on TVPipe in some crowd reaction, spin LCDs, fade up music and cut to commercialCongratulations, you paid $70 to watch 20minutes of TV, bet you thought the cinema was expensive.SeaWorld: What I think you missed is that we pay to see the animals, live, in-person. We can watch them on TV at home with less commercials."
2240,4/2/2012,5,"I used SeaWorlds Lost & Found office while recently at the park. I must admit they were very helpful, easy to find, and most of all they shipped my lost items to my home (free of charge) within a few days of leaving the park. I don't typically use Lost & Found at large parks like this, but SeaWorld went above and beyond and surprised us by shipping back the pair of shoes we lost."
2241,12/18/2008,5,"A Full Year of Fun. We have had Seaworld season passes for many years, and since we live in PB, it's just a short drive to the park. We consider it another place to play, just like any other park in the area, just amp'd up on steroids. We opted for the ""Fun Card"" annual pass, which is the same cost as a one-day admission. So if you go for one day, you might as well get the Fun Card - same price! The passes allow us to get in at any time, and during the summer we spend 2-3 days a week there, getting dragged around by my 5 year old. With the annual passes you also get several guest passes - those I give to my visiting family. If you go during a holiday, expect a huge crowd and far-away parking (unless you get there early). Â  We usually take a backpack full of towels, blankets, and food. Â AFter a few hours of walking around, we go find our favorite grassy gnoll, spread a blanket, and eat our tasties. Â I'm not about to drop $50 for long waits for park food.They have re-done the water-play area into a Sesame Street themed area with 3 small rides and a revised water play ship. You can no longer go up on the ship and squirt the hapless passers-by. In fact, I disappointed they down-scaled the water play area, as this could have been a great summer place to stay cool and have the kids burn off energy. I was hoping for something like the water area at Lego Land, but no such luck. There are great shows and hands on places where you can feed seals, or pick up a starfish. Other previously mentioned shows are also a winner. The wife and I like to go here at night and walk around, chill, see the lights, and just have a quiet time for us. She always seems to be the one that samples the beers at the beer garden since I'm driving. Maybe it's her turn to drive. One night she took me there for what was supposed to be a romantic sit-down dinner, but come to find out the only place to do that is the ""Dine With Shamu"" experience, which requires reservations made at the front gate BEFORE you go in, and they only have a few seating times. Wandering the park for another 30 minutes we finally opted for a burger. The Shipwreck Reef cafe is neat since it has a winding seating area that has many secluded nooks and crannies, plus it is right by the water ride for wet people watching. If you are military, they offer a once-a-year 4-ticket package for free. Check out herosalute.com for all the details. One last funny story, I took my 5 year old there for a day of play, and she said she wanted to go on the new Journey to Atlantis ride. Little did she know that it was a high flying, steep dropping ride. Needless to say she screamed the whole way, clutching my arm. When we went through the exit, and get to review our pictures they take when we do the big drop, there I am with a big excited smile, and there she is with a complete look of horror as we drop the 100 feet. Well, she doesn't want to go on that ride anymore."
2242,4/24/2012,5,How can you not love this place!!!!!!!!! its was awesome. Go to the water ride at night the crowd is less and you can ride it over and over.. THIS WAS A GREAT TIME
2243,7/3/2012,3,"For some reason I remembered sea world being much cooler when I was a kid. Alas, maybe we just didn't go to the right areas? Waited for about 20minutes in line to pickup our tickets from will call. Â Recommendation - print out your tickets from home if you get the chanceSon really liked the ropes, tunnels and the bouncy thing. The shows not so much, which is odd because I used to think that those were so much fun...I had enough junk food and snacks to last a few months, but that's what you're allowed to do while on vacation, right?"
2244,12/29/2011,4,"I have been visiting Sea World since my very early age while growing up in San Diego. Â The improvements over he years have made this an amazing place for children. Â The killer whale display was a jaw dropping experience for my daughter, and was a great joy for me to watch the amazement on her face."
2245,8/10/2013,4,"I really enjoyed my time here, however, I wish I could have stayed longer. I was able to see sharks, dolphins, starfish, turtles, puffins, pet show, Cirque de la Mer, polar bears, and go on the Wild Arctic Ride. They are a bit pricey, but definitely not as expensive as Disneyland. Passing by the Dolphin Interaction area, I thought it was really cool how I was approaching the rocks to try and see the dolphins because there were so many people near the attraction looking at the dolphins. All of a sudden a dolphin flipped right in front of me. I thought this attraction was really cool! Definitely worth it!"
2246,2/28/2011,4,"I love Sea World, usually everything about it. I went yesterday and have some good and bad things to say. I really enjoy being here, but wanted to gripe about a really bad show.First the good:The grounds, people, health of the animals, conditions of their habitats, and the flowers. They were all amazing. We saw the Sea Lion Show, called SLL, Sea Lions Live, like Saturday Night Live. There was pre-show entertainment which was super. It was a guy doing all kids of dances from many movies. He got into character and was in costume for each - he was great. The rest of that show was great as well. The Bad:We were pretty excited about the new dolphin show, now called Blue Horizons. Wow, was it bad. Seriously it was about 25% animals and 75% people. The performers were on wires and flying around the stadium dressed as the previous animal. They had lots of diving and then some swinging on the trapeze. The dolphin and whale part was good, but not enough of the show focused on them, more on the performers. Personally, I liked the fake audience family member falling in the water that I had seen 15 times more than the new show. It felt a little like the Cirque de la Mer, but without the quality."
2247,4/17/2010,4,"I've lived here for 6 years and have been dying to go! We finally got there yesterday! The entire experience was remarkable. Thank you Rachel from guest services, your ceaseless hospitality and friendly service went above and beyond. And Haylee... the dolphin experience was incredible! Your interaction with Crunch and your extensive knowledge about each of the other dolphins made it such a privilege to meet/greet your work-family. Â Thank you so much for making that possible and to your entire team for hosting us!"
2248,5/23/2012,3,"We had fun looking through the glass at huge fish, penguines and sharks. Really pricy, so I would suggest the annual pass because it's not that much more."
2249,6/19/2015,1,never try to get to a live person on the phone. i have been on hold for 30 minutes just to ask a simple question. i guess my group of 100 will end up at the zoo or disneyland. Â way better customer service there.
2250,2/13/2010,3,"Wow. Tickets are expensive.And how much for the parking???Dolphin show was lame -i guess they were being trained for some other new show, so they didn't do much at all.Shamu was a bit bigger than expected but that's okay. They will try to sell you a cheaply made poncho after showing footage of spectators being heavily soaked by Shamu -but barely any splashing in reality. By the end of the show, the sun will be literally melting that poncho onto your back and you will be high from its fumes. Food was unbearably tasteless. Low sodium, low taste, high calorie. We witnessed at least two families being attacked and robbed by seagulls. Plan on dining elsewhere. Do not miss the Sea lion & otter show."
2251,12/29/2013,2,"It was super crowded (we just went during the holidays so I think they granted a lot of vacation), the lines were long for everything (restroom, food, rides). It took us an hour and a half from our hotel which was a mile away from seas world to get to park. It was 84 dollars per person which is pretty hefty. The food was not good and super expensive. They check your bags on the way in and they do not allow snacks or food. Only bottled water. We saw the one ocean show with the killer whales and it was not how I remembered it when I was young. I noticed the trainers didn't go in the water. When I was young the trainers would do super cool tricks with the whales and it was amazing. Not so much anymore which was disappointing and this was confirmed by my mother also. Sometimes you think oh when I was a kid I thought it was cool because I was a kid. But no, sea world is just not the same. When I go to Disney land, I still have that Magical feeling. Not at sea world. The animals look okay, they don't look like they are being mistreated, but those pools are just not big enough for them. It's pretty obvious that they need more room to swim. The aquarium was pretty lame too. Not that many cool fishes. Overall I feel like I wasted my money. Just go to the beach and go to San Diego zoo. The zoo is awesome!!! So cool and not so crowded there! Sorry sea world I will not be returning."
2252,5/9/2012,3,This place was just ok the rides where extremely boring and the only part I liked about this place was the amazing animal show and the awesome souvenir shop. This place is mainly meant for younger kids though.Rides:FCleanliness:AOver all:C
2253,9/10/2014,1,"I wanted to make sure people know how SEA WORLD does business, a year ago I signed up for the ez pay for annual passes. Â I was happy to see they have a program like DISNEYLAND and KNOTT'S BERRY FARM. WELL DON'T BE FOOLED NOTHING LIKE THOSE PARKS. If you don't cancel your ez pay with SEA WORLD they continue to take from your bank account. YES THIS IS IN THE CONTRACT but it is not something you read up front, it's not the FIRST BOLD LINE you read. Â So they have taken 2 extra months from my bank and all they said they can do is extend my pass for 2 additional months since I have paid. Â Well I don't want to go to that park anymore, I would prefer my $64 dollars back. Â SEA WORLD needs to take notes from DISNEYLAND AND KNOTT'S they don't even pull something like this. Â So BUYERS BEWARE when you purchase an ez pay pass from SEA WORLD, keep track and cancel when the 12months is up, or they will be glad to continue taking from your bank, and THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU A REFUND."
2254,9/23/2014,1,"If I can rate this place zero star, I would; mainly for its devious tactics of ""bait and switch"" to invite healthcare workers in for a promotion and then turn us away as if we were beggars. Â Let me begin by explaining that there was a promotion going on after May honoring individuals who were ""first responders"" to the wildfires that happened in SD, including emergency medical entities. Â The promotion is still going until September 26th. Â After standing long hours in line, we showed their staff the vouchers and our badge and she said that they don't honor _____ Healthcare entities as they are not part of the ""first responders"". Â We told them that several of our colleagues were able to get in previously and their response was their staffs didn't know and allowed people in by mistake. Â We requested to speak to a supervisor and she too, had said the same thing. Â She asked what kind of contribution did we do in our job to help the wildfires? Â I told her victims and/or even FIRST RESPONDERS coming with respiratory distress from smoke inhalation or anything that requires medical assistance we would treat and not turned away. Â They still confirmed and dismissed our qualification and instead, offered a discount where if you pay full price for one adult, a child can get in for free. Â We did not want to disappoint our nieces and already cleared our schedule so we decided to cough up the money and go in. Â Two days after my rejection, I heard they still let my colleagues and several other hospital entities in for either 1/2 off ticket with a free child or completely FREE due to the fact that they were willing to make a scene in public. Â I am dismayed by this tactic Seaworld is putting out there to lure in gullible individuals. Â I feel degraded that the type of care you choose to be in influences the level of respect and honor you are perceived by the community. Â Not only so, it's appalling to see the inconsistencies SeaWorld does in offering their customer services. Â Next time, I guess I'll make a scene. Â Oh wait, there won't be a next time!"
2255,11/20/2011,5,"It's been forever since I'd been here. Â I want to say 15 years (dang, I just aged myself)!. Â I was pleasantly delighted that SeaWorld has evolved into a lovely amusement park and animal show. Â I especially enjoyed the shows and getting splashed by Shamu was especially delightful because it was so hot! Â Lines were reasonable (then again, I went on a Friday) and all the animals were accessible. Â It was really a nice time."
2256,6/26/2011,4,"Sea World is a great place for the family, especially the younger ones. It's worth it Â to upgrade to Premium Pass/Seating for the shows."
2257,8/4/2007,3,Day time Shamu has tanked! Â ... or maybe jumped the shark!!Shamu Believe:I think this was my 5th trip to Sea World in the last 15 years or so. Â The Killer Whale show has always been an important foundation of the SW experience. Â They've gutted it ... Â virtually all they do are a few jumps and heave outs and the rest of the time is concentrated on splashing the first 16 rows. The don't even swim with the Killer Whales any more!Shamu Rocks:The night time show is MUCH better. Â One cast member swims and rides with one of the smaller KW's. Â There is more coordinated KW action and much less emphasis on splashing people.Daytime Shamu ... don't bother ... the Bottlenose Dolphins put on a Â better show.Pictures on my website ... see profile.
2258,6/30/2011,2,"If you are going to just enjoy looking at the beautiful animals without expecting much of an ""amusement park experience"" then you probably will think this place is great. Â If not, and you are nitpicky like I am (because i expect more when paying $69 a person), the following things will bother you: 1) You cannot get a a beverage with a lid and drinkable straw unless you buy a souvenier cup. Â What a joke! I was only able to drink 1/2 my soda until a bug flew in it. Gross! Secondly, their straws are made out of cardboard (think tampon applicator material) so they will disintegrate pretty rapidly. Â 2) The employees are bored, disinterested in their job and have little customer service training. Â This stood out to me because we are used to white-glove service from Disneyland employees. 3) The trash cans in a lot of the bathrooms are overflowing with paper towels. 4) Service at all the restaurants was S--L--O--W (again, attributed to the employees looking bored). 4) No alternative sides other than french fries. Practically all the entrees are served with fries. Â So unhealthy. 5) The shamu show no longer involves stunts with the trainers. Â I know that a trainer recently died from an accident involving shamu, very tragic indeed. However, I wish I would have known that they had completely changed the show since then. Â One thing I did love though, they paid tribute and recognized all the current and past members of the US military. Â Very awesome! Â If you do visit Seaworld, I hope you have a better experience."
2259,3/4/2012,5,Always great to get away and tk a lil vacation.. love it
2260,6/19/2011,5,"The new turtle reef, dolphin show and the we shamoo show is Awesome!!!! The shark encounter will always be my favorite but I must say since you can't get in the water with the whales still they new show is better. It keeps your mind off of the fact that it isn't the same."
2261,4/2/2012,4,This place is great but can be a little annoying when packed especially when your being pushed around through all the exhibits by crowds or kids. The staff is about 50/50 we have run into some great people but occasionally we get the ones that are rude and burnt out for the day. Lot of the merchandise is highly overpriced but most of it is for donation purposes. Love their Ez-pay option for season passes so we dont have to come up with so much upfront. Highly recommend this park for families and kids.
2262,6/30/2011,5,I love taking my kids here. They have great shows and wonderful animals to look at. There new turtle reef is pretty cool but I think I will wait a while to go see it again since there are so many people.
2263,3/25/2011,5,"We went here with the fams when my daughter was 11 months old. It was the first time my daughter went to an amusement park and we all had a blast. Shamu show is a must if you've never been, as well as the show in the dolphin stadium and sea lion and otter. If the line is long at the Atlantis ride, don't bother, it's sooo short"
2264,10/2/2011,5,I freaking love seaworld. I Love all the shows and how clean the park it. I love everything about it. I love perl and clover. BEST PLACE EVER
2265,3/19/2011,4,Ive been coming here since I was a child. Took off a star for being overpriced. Its about the same price as Disneyland yikes! But I love what they do for injured sea life. And its a nice day walking around here.
2266,10/14/2010,4,"I am a Silver Pass member and go to Sea World almost monthly with my young son and we love it, that is, once we get past the front entrance. Â Sea World has the slowest, worst system to get in the gate. Â I think it is faster to enter the US from TJ than it is to get through the gates of Sea World. Â First you have to scan your membership card, which could take a couple of times, then you have to use your index finger to scan your fingerprint, which again usually takes several attempts. Â We visited last Saturday and when I went to scan my card, it would not read. Â My choice was to either go back and stand in the 20 minute customer service line, or read off the 16-digit number from my card to the gate attendant as she typed it in. Â I choose the latter and that also took 2 attempts. Â Keep in mind, that there were about 20 people in line behind me waiting to go through the same torture. Â It took close to 3 minutes to get through the gate. Â That doesn't seem like a long time, except for the fact that there have got to be several hundred thousand visitors each day that have to go through the same slow torture to get in. Â In this day and age, I would think they would have a less complicated, more efficient system in place.The rest of the day was great and we really enjoy what's on the inside of the border crossing, once you make it in."
2267,8/20/2015,5,"Went on a Tuesday ..my kids rode the blue roller coaster 14 times in a row and the shipwreck ride 9 times in a row. Â Especially if you hit the rides that are by an ongoing show. Â Once people come out of the show the lines fill up. Â The food is expensive a bag of cheetos was 3.50...lol. Â the lockers to put your stuff in while u ride is a great idea, especially if you have things u don't want to get wet. Â We did the Dine with Shamu lunch and the food was spectacular. We also did close up parking, it was 21 dollars but Soooo worth it. Â The workers were friendly and informative. Â We purchased tickets on line and got straight in. Â The dine with shamu show and the shamu show were basically the same. Â  We had a great day. Â That all being said, the animals seemed healthy but some of the tanks seemed a little crowded..and the whales seemed so rambunctious like they would love to get out in the ocean and just go for it and SWIM!!!!!!!. Â There were tons of restaurants, almost too many. Â Even the few times the lines were long the attendants were very good about keeping things moving. Â We had a super fun day but for my kids it was more about the rides. Â We have an aquatic zoo by our house so alot of the fish attractions were kind of old news to them. Â We don't have sharks tho so they got a charge out of seeing the sharks..the app would have been good to have because it's a big place and trying to zig zag all over the park to get to the shows on time didn't work out very well. Â Next time I'm definitely bringing a zip lock bag for cell phones and cameras etc. Â We were pretty much soaking wet the whole day. Â We really did have fun tho."
2268,11/18/2010,5,"We came here on the ""Here's to the Heroes"" sponsorship of the military and their families. I was deployed to Iraq for a year and seeing companies do this for the military is great. It gives us an opportunity to take our family to the park. I'll tell you what, after getting shot at and being damn near killed a couple times you learn to treasure things like going to the park with your kids.On to the review. Let me get two things out before I continue. It was on my mind after reading some of the previous reviews.- I'm happy there isn't a free beer garden. Less chance for drunk drivers. Anheuser-Busch sponsors the ""heroes"" program, if they don't want to give you free beer, oh well.-What's with the hippies who cry in their reviews after seeing wildlife in a park. You know darn well what you were coming to. Were you expecting to come to a park with pictures on the wall of animals in their natural habitat or animals in enclosed environments? Want to support the ecosystem? Great. Donate to a charity that supports your cause or use your free speech to speak against this in public forums at your college.review1. Â Rides/Attractions:My son really enjoyed the Sesame Street playground. It is an enclosed area with a net the kids can climb up to rope bridges (secured on the sides so they can't fall off) and tunnels to climb through. There were two staff members up to to ensure the flow of kids went in the right direction and as safeties at key intersections.Whale shows: GREAT. I actually enjoyed how the park took the time to explain how they trained the whales ensuring that they were well cared for. Killer whales doing jumps out of the water. Exactly what I expected and it didn't disappoint. Aquariums: Several places where kids can touch rays (not the ones that sting) and feed them (I think it was $6 for a tray of fish). There is a starfish pool and even sea turtles chilling out on the side of a small sandy area.Sky Tower: Four dollars each for adults and and kids older than two (I think because my son is three). Yes, it was worth it. Got a great view of the city and my kid enjoyed the ""big elevator ride"".2. Strollers:We could take our stroller into all of the aquariums we went to, but if you want to go to the shows (i.e. Shamu) you will need to park your stroller outside. Don't leave any high-priced items in your stroller of course and if some low-life wants to steal a diaper bag then shame on them.3. Food:It's an amusement park. I didn't expect to see Costco prices here. We ate at Calypso's and the portions were quite filling for the cost. They have a special for those who plan on eating lunch and dinner at the park for $29.99 (adults). We ate dinner elsewhere so we didn't use this option. Yes there is beer there, just no free beer garden like somebody cried about in a previous review. There is a guy who makes a mean mocha out front for when you leave the park. 4. Gifts/Pictures:We picked up one of the pictures from the guys who take random shots around the park. Good shot, exposure was set right and it was well framed. We also stopped by the gift shop and picked up some items for the kids.5. Staff: Absolutely professional at every meeting. Summary: It was what I expected and if I lived anywhere near San Diego my family would get annual passes. Due to our commitment Â to the military Uncle Sam sends us where he needs us most, and unfortunately it isn't the great town of San Diego (I'm not in the Navy). The entry tickets were free thanks to Seaworld and their support of military families, but we made sure to pay it back by eating there and getting some gifts at the gift shops.-Fourlights"
2269,3/29/2015,5,"Rating Seaworld's Animal rescue program. Living in San Diego we often see in the news how this organization is going out to our beaches to save sea life. Lately it has been the sea lions. Unfortunately there has been an increase of pups left behind by their mothers and had it not been for this organization picking them up and rehydrating them and feeding them, they would die. Â Yesterday while at the beach we had our very own injured sea lion encounter. It was stuck at the jetty as it had tried to eat a large fish lure. Our kids found the poor thing and told us about it. We called the Seaworld Animal Rescue team and they were able to get there within the hour. They told us the seal was older and not a pup. They tried several attempts at a rescue but unfortunately it dove back into the ocean. Â They told us and the lifeguards they will be back the next morning to try again as they are pretty certain it will go back to this location. Hopefully they can get it this time to get the lure out of its mouth and feed it a little bit before sending it back into the ocean. Â Thank you for helping us protect our sea life!"
2270,10/16/2011,2,It is fun to go once in a lifetime. Overpriced park. Poor animals are probably better off in the wild than worked like slaves to just be kept in a tank.
2271,5/8/2011,3,Not as great as it used to be. I miss the manatees. I have an annual pass and I still like to visit the place for a select few exhibits. Crowds can be frustrating and you never know when there will be one or when it will be dead. It's worth it if you have the annual pass and when you have nothing to do.
2272,2/18/2016,3,"Sea world was very enjoyable. The touch tanks were pretty cool, they have fish that eat the dead skin off your hands, but they don't take allergies into consideration. They also don't clean up the area near the touch tanks. A member in my group had recently broken his leg, and slipped on some water near the tanks, they made a good effort to help him but once again they didn't take into consideration allergies that he may of had to the medicine they gave him. From there we went to see the dolphin show witch was very good but people in the splash zone didn't get splashed. Then we went to the killer whale show and it was amazing. The people in the splash zone got splashed, but they got more splashed by the fountains then the whales. When we went on rides we found the roller coaster ""Manta"" to be a very enjoyable coaster. It was very smooth and safe. The food was very over priced but it was tasty. Overall sea world was decent but they could put more effort into everything."
2273,8/28/2011,4,I've lived in San Diego my whole life so I've been to Sea World many times and have always a great time. I've always enjoyed the shows and seeing all the animals that Sea World has to offer. It is definitely a great place to spend a day. I especially like going in the summer when they are open after dark and have special shows also a lot of the crowd goes away so it is not as crowded. The only problem with Sea World these days is that they are getting really expensive and they starting to put in roller coasters. I guess to compete with Magic Mountain and Knotts Berry Farm. I wish they would take that money that they are putting towards these roller coasters and put it into building cool exhibits like the Shark Encounter and the new Turtle Reef.
2274,6/14/2011,5,I love seaworld! I have always had a great time and I love that if you go once you can come the rest of the year for free. One person always gets the higher card so we get free parking but it is worth it! Yes it is crowded but it is a theme park so thats the way it should be.
2275,9/19/2011,4,"Had a really good time. The shows are fun and lots to seee. The food, well let's say it is typical amusment park fare and the pricing...OUCH!"
2276,6/9/2015,4,"Wow what's happened to Sea World ! The only thing that has changed is the prices and $16 to park ? After you're already coming out almost a $100 to get in . Lol , then the shows are all like info brochures . I was almost snoring . I really think the seal show , is the same stage as decades ago . Hey Sea World ... Psst "" if you want to make more profit , and not suffer the backlash of BLACKFISH, stop defending yourselves so obviously , that it puts people to sleep . Stop charging people to park at a place , they have already payed for , wow . Put some money into the park and open up new exhibits and shows , and upgrade , make things newer . Tacky marketing people , and strategy, the money from the parking alone can pay for it lol . The potential can be huge , just need to place like 3 new exhibits and shows at least , then Sea World will go back to being awesome . We want new animals , new shows , lower the price of parking ... Also Sea World has addressed the killer whale issue , even doing away with its most popular show , that all you haters were cheering on for 30 years before Blackfish and most companies would not even try to fix it . Let's give them some credit . Again it's always fun at Sea World , but it just seems as though the pro needs to be more modernized and needs more exhibits ."
2277,8/25/2011,4,Was not crazy about the dolphin show for it was more about the people performers than the dolphins. Shamu show is good. The whales give a good performance. They really know how to wet the crowd which is what alot of people liked. Sea Lion Live show i liked the best.
2278,5/25/2012,1,"MANTA = Way disappointed!! Â  1st-- They opened the ride too soon. Â They were pushing for a deadline and the attraction is obviously not ready, landscaping, decor etc.. not done. Â 2nd-- My partner and I are platinum members and we spend a lot of money at SeaWorld (Is anyone listening over there??) Â We were so excited about the new ride. Â We waited a long time, through lots of recordings and delays, finally got on the ride and long story short.. we had to get off the ride, they said the sensor on the lap bar was saying we couldn't go. Â The lap bar was down so far and tight i could not wiggle. Â My FAT ASS isn't THAT fat, I fit in every roller coaster I've ever gotten on, I sit in regular seats, I don't need ""special"" extenders, I shop at regular stores.. Like many people ya, I'm big.. but come on.. SeaWorld knew there was a sensor problem, but did not educate their staff Â or people intending to ride. Â  Even if they had a general message up .. just like the ""don't ride if"" signs.. it would of avoided a lot of embarrassment, anger, wasted time etc for a lot of people and a lot of people had the same problem we did. Â Really lack of foresight on their part. Â Very disappointed in their lack of training or response to the (should of been expected) bugs and glitches on their new attraction. Â  So SCREW-EM Â me and my FAT ASS are going to DISNEYLAND."
2279,1/8/2010,1,"Wow! Lots of reviews for Seaworld like Spiritwalker -- no CamelCase here. Shall I dare to add my deluge of words and become the 279th review?First off our recent visit (nuclear family + the g-parents) left me feeling dirty and not in a good way. We dropped over 500 bones on entry fees, parking, sustenance, and incidentals. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS! I know I'm supposed to be all blase about cash and act like I spend 5 benjamins all the time on champagne and stilletos, but I am a WORKING man. It's really a lot of money for nuthin but I guess that goes without saying in our consumerist culture. Ok, here's the thing about Seaworld...the ""park"" cannot decide if it's an amusement park Ã  la Knotsberry farm or they have a serious preservation mission Ã  la the SD Zoo & Wild Animal Park. So you have crazy rides AND sketchy animal exhibits and THEY FAIL AT BOTH. Seriously, pick one and do it right! But don't dillydally, confusing us with your half-hearted stabs at ""protecting"" wild life like the beluga whale, which is ""near-threatened"" (a fact that was never mentioned once in the exhibit) in your ""Wild Artic"" exhibit and then disgust us with your carbon-munching ice wall, grotesque flashing lights, loud faux radio station and broken-down props that just remind us we are in temperate San Diego and you want us out of there ASAP cos we're just taking up space. Ooops. Got a little worked up there.The penguin exhibit is terribly sad. The first thing you notice is the unmistakable aroma of...wait for it...GUANO. Yup, 500 bones into this fiasco and I smell wet diaper, which I could smell for free over at La Jolla Cove (with a better view!). The birds seem very crowded. It's like Manhattan in there, but with less airspace. Now penguins are cool and it seems like it would be difficult to make them suck, but whew, congratulations, Seaworld, you did it! With the hopes of redeeming the disquieting feeling of doom we tried to take some time by going up to the observation area behind the moving ""walkway"". They had some benches so we thought it would be perfect to kick back and chill with the penguins. WRONG! They don't want you to sit there and to emphasize that they have these screens embedded into the wall that shout the most inane crap at you. While we were there some jackhorse was screeching at people ""How do penguins walk?"" and these horribly misshapen people were doing their best approximation of penguins. Gaaaa! Twas a nightmare!. Then we made our way to the Shark exhibit, which was actually the best part of the day. Okay, sharks, awesome. Yay. Here is something that didn't slap you in the face with horrific grotesqueness. Yup, that's the best I can say. Thankfully, the park was rather empty and we were able to walk backwards on the moving ""walkway"" that they use to cart your carcass out of the way of other carcasses on busier days. What is it with these things? Can I just stop and enjoy something for a moment? Why must I always be moving forward? Is it because I might start to notice how insincere and full of crap everything at this place is? Hmmm.Overall, the one redeeming factor is that kids seem to have a good time. The Shamu show made my wife tear up a bit, but she's a softie. In many ways, I think I might have been better off waiting for a super sale from Southwest and heading up north to the California Academy of Sciences for the day so that I could see what an aquarium is supposed to look like. It would be great if the mega-corporation that oversees Seaworld would invest in its message of sealife conservation so that you would at least feel a little bit good about forking over all of that money but as it is this place is one big disappointment. Blerg."
2280,5/21/2007,1,"A total rip off. Â This was the low point of my trip to San Diego. Â There is hardly anything to do there, and what there is, you will have to stand in a massive line for. Â What a waste of money."
2281,3/20/2010,1,"I've been dragged to this place numerous times. Â Often for company events. Â Even free, I'd rather go to the zoo (where animals are actually treated well) or go to the park or go scuba diving. Â Let's be honest, seeing a caged dolphin really doesn't compare to coming across them in the sea. Â And the dolphins would probably agree... Â 1. It's ridiculously expensive to do simple things like park your car. Â Even if you have a pass, you're still gonna fork over for the right to park your car. Â Food, etc is all way overpriced.2. The attractions are rather staid. Â We can watch intelligent, caged animals be forced to do simple tricks or we can go on rides that are sub-standard compared to say Disneyland.3. The place is crowded and dirty. Â Just ick. Â Nothing seems modern.4. Their entire business model is a sham and a relic from another time. Â We know they're not in this to do anything altruistic for the animals they've got there. Â This isn't the zoo. Â No research. Â No humane conditions. Â Nothing is done without an eye on the all-powerful buck (well the Euro is more powerful and so is the Pound but I digress...).Anyway, spend your money on a good aquarium (like in Monterey) or spend it at a zoo (that's devoted to protecting species). Â But this corporate hellhole, no, it's just a lot of cash to see creatures exploited."
2282,8/19/2009,2,"Sea World... I always feel so guilty liking Sea World. I feel guilty seeing the marine animals under lock down.... like the belugas. I love beluga whales but I hate to see them in captivity. I can't stand the sight of seeing a magnificent mammal swim circles in a confined pool. Yet, I can't afford to travel to the Arctic or Alaska to admire the belugas ""the sea canary's"" in their natural habitat. So, Sea World's Arctic exhibit is it. I hung out at the exhibit for two hours wishing for a cafe in the exhibit, so I could sit and watch the belugas. Instead, I Â listened to the marine biologist speak and inform visitors about the belugas. These biologist stick to the script and avoid critics questions. One man asked, ""how long do these belugas live in captivity?' The biologist refused to answer only saying she was not allowed to answer. She made the hint that big brother is watching. I was baffled by this one... Big brother? Anheuser Busch doesn't want you to answer? What? What is with the secrecy?It is known that all beluga whales and all marine wildlife in captivity do have a short life expectancy compared to marine life free in the wild. It bothered me to see such gorgeous creatures so confined. It also bothered me to see a polar bear confined to a small cramp space in the Arctic exhibit. The polar bear was adjacent to the beluga exhibit and the poor bear looked depressed. Polar bears eat sea lions and belugas. They can smell their prey up to 20 miles away. Talk about a food mind fuck on an animal, especially since the polar bear is less than 40 feet from the beluga exhibit. The poor bear must be going nuts. That's like you and I being trapped in jail and having an In N Out burger parked right outside our cell. I hate the way Sea World pimps the marine animals with their shows. It's disturbing to witness these majestic marine life animals jump threw hoops like circus clowns, while we human's stuff ourselves with beer, nachos and churros. Yes, we laugh in amazement, but it's a bit twisted. It's also wrong to pay $50 (coupon included) per person for admission into a park that suckers every parent into buying cute stuffed animals and overpriced food for their kids. And you know parents have to buy a toy for their kids. Little ones beg for a piece of Shamu. Â Anheuser Busch, owners of all the Sea World parks, are master manipulators who take advantage of every visitors. The food is over pricey and sucks. Between the food, merchandise and admission, you can easily be out $300 in a day's visit. Fougetaboutit!Every gift shop and kiosk is strategically placed at the tail end of an exhibit, pulling on patron's heart strings and manipulating you to pony up cash for some chotchky or trinket. Â Anheuser-Busch takes advantage of that poor Seine driving, Graco stroller moving parent who arrives at Â Sea World with that tantrum throwing child that must get his way. Should you be one of these parents, avoid this place until the kid is 21. Then, let the kid take his own kids to Sea World."
2283,8/24/2011,5,My gf and me went here for a trip with our friends. I never been to the SD SeaWorld but only the one that used to be in the bay area. But this place brought me back to when I was a kid. A bunch of attractions! Good food! I never a freakin porcupine was soo big! They have Dip-in Dots were is always a plus. The Shamoo show was the best! We didn't sit in the stands but people were getting soaked in the first 10 rows. I would definitely come here again!
2284,8/23/2011,3,It's been over twenty years since I had been to SeaWorld and I realized that I hadn't missed too much. Â The kiddie rides are very weak but the shows were good. Â I thought the dolphin show was better than Shamu. Â A little confusing getting around the park. Â Things seem to be spaced out so its hard to get to them.
2285,11/18/2011,5,I visited SeaWorld again with my family after a long hiatus and was pleasantly surprised by all of the new changes. Â I visited SeaWorld for the first time about a decade ago before I moved away. Â SeaWorld has grown and now it's almost becoming an amusement park. Â I'm not a fan of roller coasters but there are a few there if you are into it. Â We basically planned our day around the shows and there just isn't enough time so see all of them. Â I know Shamu is the superstar but my favorite show was the sea lions. Â Those critters are not just adorable but have so much personality; it's a joy to watch them. Â I went back two more times since then with my coworkers for our company picnic as well as for Spooktacular during Halloween. Â I still haven't seen everything I wanted to see so I have an annual pass now. Â It's always a party to visit SeaWorld!
2286,8/17/2011,5,Seaworld is so much fun ! Our family had the best time !
2287,1/13/2009,1,"Sea World was so cool when I was a kid. Now you can't touch hardly any animals and it is more like a theme park than an educational experience. The only thing that kept it from being a total waste is that you can drink free beer and see some horses at the Budwiser Paddocks, of course it's only Budwiser so it wasn't worth the price of admission at all. Save your money or better yet use it to go to a really good place - The San Diego Zoo!"
2288,1/11/2010,1,"Very disappointing. Way too overpriced. Â Simply put , it just blows.$69 = 1 Adult Admission$59= 1 Child Admission$12= Â  2 trays of fish to feed the dolphins ( 6 little fish in total)$20= 1 shirt , 1 skirt ( We got absolutely soaked Â on the 1 adult ride that Â they DON'T charge for)$47= 2 plates of food, 1 kid's meal ( Â We were still hungry after. Don't bother going to Calypso Bay Smokehouse)$21 = 3 drinks, 1 bag of potato chips, and a Â bag of candyTotal Â = A WASTE OF TIME!!!There were 2 adults and 1 child, and even with the discounted tickets, I Â spent way too much. The only rides they don't charge for are the 3 kiddie rides in the Sesame Street section and Â the 1 Â ride where you get SOAKING WET. Â They close early (6 pm) and all of their shows are limited to a very few number of times throughout the day. Dolphin show was lame. It lasted maybe 20 minutes max. The Shamu show was kinda neat, I guess.They picked some kid from the audience to interact with Shamu. Â I wonder how much that cost. Â I think it would have been way cooler if they picked my child, but whatever.They kept mentioning a new show they were putting together called Blue Horizons that will open in May of 2010. Nice try! I won't be back.Oh yeah, and they open late (10 am). If you are going to charge what you charge for admission, at least make it worthwhile for patrons.If you want to feed a dolphin, Â the Â last feeding is at 12:15 pm and yes they sell beer here at this lovely, child friendly establishment . (What the hell? Don't they make enough money on admission and everything else they charge for?)"
2289,7/21/2010,2,"Eh, I expected more... But it's not bad. Â Military gets in for free once a year and they have fireworks every night."
2290,12/11/2012,4,"Ok first off, I am a disney kid so this review is written by someone who is bias about theme parks. I have also worked at Legoland California so I know what to expect as far as employees. Moving on, my girlfriend and my self decided earlier this year that maybe we would not continue with our Disneyland Annual Passes ( we have since repurchased them lol could not live with out a little Disney in our lives ;)) so we saw that at Costco we could each get a Silver SeaWorld pass for 99.00 each that also includes parking. We bought them and have since gone about 5-6 times. I am a huge marine biology guy, heck I went to school to become one at one point in my life. SeaWorld does an amazing job of emerging one into the world of the ocean. They also have a brand new roller coaster that is pretty awesome as well. Now if you have read any of my other reviews you'll know that beer is a big thing for me and SeaWorld has got my back there. They offer the SeaWorld Pilsner Glass(plastic) for about 10.99 I believe, it is 16 ounces. Best thing about it is that you can bring it back to anywhere that sells draft beer and get a refill for about 5.99-6.99. The selection is awesome they have Shocktop (Regular, Rasberry and Wheat IPA) Stone (IPA, Pale Ale, Levitation Ale) Karl Strauss (Heff, Tower 10 IPA, Red Trolley ect.) An amazing selection of beer. Over all SeaWorld is a great place for young and old and I will be renewing both my pass. THANKS SHAMPOO...errrr...SHAMU!"
2291,8/23/2011,5,"Busy and expensive, but the best place to see sea creatures (and some bears!) in Southern California. Â So much cool stuff to see."
2292,9/18/2008,4,"I have been to SeaWorld so many times when I was a kid. Â Now that I have my own kid it is making me experience all these things I loved when I was young. Â One of those things was going to SeaWorld.The price of admission is high. Â If I didn't buy the FunPass that allows you to come all year long for the price of one paid admission then I would rather skip it until my kid is old enough to wash my car, rub my feet, and beg me to see Shamu. Â With a two year old and Fun Pass in hand this place is the perfect spot to spend a few hours here while only paying for parking and a couple snacks. Â The Bay of Play is the new Seasame Street themed play area which is a great addtion to SeaWorld. Â It has three rides that I could take my 2 year old daughter on which was an exciting new experience for her. Â There is also an area called the tide pool which looks like a gigantic water bed with soft blocks and shaps the little ones can crawl all over. I agree that the food is over priced but it's the same at any theme park. Â At least they serve free mini samples of Â beer in the hospitality center."
2293,2/17/2011,3,Sea World is nothing like it used to be. The shows involve less animals and more people. Still was a lot of fun but wont be going back until they get th animals more involve again
2294,8/24/2011,4,"First time there in a VERY long time, had a blast with my wife but it's a once a year place at the very most (maybe locals feel differently but we live in LA). Â Shamu show was cool, sucks the trainers don't dive in the tank anymore. Â Dolphin show was too Cirque du Soleil like, wasn't a huge fan. Â Our favorite was the Sea Lion show, day and night show, the pre show was hilarious... Thanks Biff! Â Overall, great place to take the wife, but like I said... once a year is enough."
2295,8/23/2011,3,"meh.. Nothing much to brag about, the two main attraction of the whole park are probably Shamu and the Dolphin show, other than that, really nothing else."
2296,10/13/2011,5,"Sea World is one of the BEST PLACES to take kids! It's a great place because it's local if you live in San Diego, not as expensive compared to the other theme parks, and they have different types of spectacular shows! They even include the audience in their shows like bringing a child up on stage so Shamu can kiss him or her. I have absolutely LOVED the Shamu Show since I was little! Their shows are for all ages and I find myself laughing along with my niece and nephew. They have a few rides too now!The staff are all FRIENDLY and VERY HELPFUL. Over 25 years I've been going to Sea World and I have never experienced anyone who was rude. That just shows you what kind of place it is. I also love the fact that they have great signage. Meaning there are signs everywhere so its easy to find where you need to go very easily and you're not wasting time or getting frustrated. I still have so much fun going now even though I'm an adult. Of course the food can get pricey, but that's in every theme park you go to. I'd definitely recommend going here with or without kids or if visitors are in town because there is so much to do for everyone!"
2297,6/22/2011,4,"Sea world is really a great place.My wife and i got season passes as we live in san diego, we figured we might as well get our money's worth.We bought our passes in May, and have been back 3 times. So the extra for the tickets has paid for itself.ADVICE: if you get the season pass, get one with upgrade to free parking. i think its $30 extra, but it also pays for itself. Plus with the upgrade you get 10% off purchases.The food is a little over priced, plus the serving sizes are on the small side. They do have a picnic area outside the gates, but its kind of sad looking. they put it in like an afterthought. Right next to thhe parking lot. No grass. They really should do something a little better.another thing they should improve, the baby area in Sesame Streets bay of play. My son is just 11 months old so he cant really enjoy much at sea world. But there is this one bouncy area for babies. its great, he loves it. But when it gets sunny ( this is san diego) the plastic ground gets burning hot. Its covered with these curtains, but they really should get a full cover for it. I talked to the attendant about it. (She warned us ahead of time) She said that people complain all the time, but management wont do anything.ugh...managment, why wont you listen to the people who work for you?anyways.i enjoy myself. the food is generally good. the rides are very fun. the animal shows are entertaining. (The shamu show was a little boring)It is worth it if you get the pass and go a few times."
2298,4/20/2011,5,"Had a FUN day w/ Liza and Melvin, our Aussie Connection! Thank You so much guys! Shows were great. Next time we're gettin' wet. Rides and front row seating. Year passes were just a bonus!"
2299,8/13/2011,4,"Great place for family to visit. Good for kids and adults. I love all the shows in there. The only thing I don't like about this SeaWorld is that this one is too small compare with the seaworld in Florida. SeaWord in Florida has more variety of animals and they live in larger space. We went on Sunday in summer, so it is hot and packed with people. I would love to go again in winter during the week day."
2300,7/2/2011,5,"We always have a fabulous time at Sea World. Â We even got called on stage during the dolphin show and got to feed dolphins. Â We don't really go there for the rides, we mostly go for the exhibits and the shows, I think the dolphin show is the best show. Â The Shamu show is pretty disappointing, maybe I had to high of expectations. Â It is pretty inexpensive compared to some of the other theme parks and I think it is well worth the price."
2301,2/20/2011,4,a great place if you love whales and sea life. very calm place to be. great shows. great people. great events for the holidays and great prices on tickets and passesgreat place for kids also
2302,7/17/2011,4,"Sea World - still a great place. Some things are different now than when I was a kid - in the wake of the whale tragedy you can't feed dolphins anymore except in a VERY controlled environment that lasts a brief few seconds with one sardine, and a trainer doing the work. That was always the highlight for me. Â I'm still a fan because it's important to educate people about our ocean and conservation."
2303,6/5/2011,3,"This place isn't what it use to be. We literally finished in 3 hours. A lot of exhibits were under construction or closed. Other than that, it was a fun experience. I would have to say the most entertaining part of Sea World would have to be the sea lion show."
2304,1/9/2010,4,"OK, someone moved my review to the general Seaworld reviews. I had started a new category for the ""Bathrooms at Seaworld"", which I gave a well deserved 1 star. But when you now lump that review with all the general reviews for Seaworld, I look like a moron. Hey went to Seaworld to see Shamu, and the bathrooms were filthy 1 star. Seaworld is one of the best theme parks in the world, so even though they have 3rd world bathrooms, that should never stop you from enjoying Shamu and friends. And as a side note the BBQ joint in there, isn't too bad for theme park food. They actually finish the ribs off on a mesquite wood outdoor grill for all to smell. Doesn't quite taste as good as the smell, but nice touch for a large amusement park. They aren't too bad."
2305,7/13/2010,4,"Great fun. The killer whale/orca show was well done but also a little morbid in light of the tragedy earlier this year (but that's just me, the kids really loved that show)."
2306,9/20/2008,5,"SHAMU= IMPRESSIVE! Â DOLPHIN SHOW= IMPRESSIVE! Â STRAWBERRY CREAM FUNNEL CAKE= OUT OF THIS WORLD IMPRESSIVE!I went to SeaWorld today with my cousins and grandmother and spent about 4 hours there! Â First thing we did was hit up the Sea Lion & Otter show! Â It's called Clyde and Seamore's Risky Rescue! Â Basically if you have have seen the Sea Lion Otter show in the past where it was the creepy castle or the island adventure, then you have basically seen the show. Â It's the same exact show with new scenario, but nonetheless pretty funny! Â We then went to the Shark Encounter and Manatee Rescue exhibits! Â It's awesome but very dark, so be careful our you might walk over a kid!Then we took a sight of the Dolphin Show, Pet's Rule and ended the day with FUNNEL CAKE! Â Yup, I said Funnel Cake--you thought I'd say Shamu but NO I DIDN'T!! Â When you go to SeaWorld, you have to go to Pineapple Pete's Island Eats! Â They have a variety of different funnel cakes!! Â Can you say ""AWESOME!"" Â I can! Â AWESOME!Overall, I have to give it 5 stars cause hey if you are living in San Diego or just visiting, you have to go to SeaWorld and also I own stock in this place and I need more money!"
2307,1/26/2010,2,"First things first, what the F happened to Captain Kidd's playground? Â When did Elmo become a mascot for the fish? Â When did Celine Dion start singing the theme songs for the whales? Â What the heck happened? Â Yep it's been a few years since I've been to Sea World, but I don't remember it being this lame. Â It seems like a whole lot of walking around for not a lot of substance. Â For what they have to offer, I don't see how it can possibly add up to their inflated ticket prices. Maybe I'd have had a better time if I was 5, but I think Sea World has lost it's edge."
2308,12/27/2012,4,"I am comparing Sea World (florida) vs Sea World (San Diego). Â We believe Florida Sea World is much better and spacious than San Diego one. Â 4 to 5 hours would hardly enough to cover this one. Shamu show was ok, it used to give you WOW feeling. may be it was due to the recent mishap happend here. Anyways you will have fun on the visit when you keep the expectations limited to San Diego Sea World."
2309,6/5/2011,4,"This was our 2nd trip to Sea World from Phoenix. Â I enjoyed this trip more than our first just because we had an idea of where we wanted to go and in what order. Â This was an extremely busy weekend compared to the first time we went, but the staff kept everyone moving. Â We had a great time, and our 2 year old a better time. Â Make sure if you are purchasing the day pass, you ask about the free for the rest of the year ticket."
2310,6/5/2011,5,We go here once every 2 weeks. We have got membership. My 3 yr old son just loves the sesame street. It is real fun for the kids. I would renew the membership just for that.
2311,9/14/2010,4,"YAY I LOVE SEA WORLD! Especially the Sea Animals, the shows, the ride Journey to Atlantis and just being able to be in a fun and positive environment enjoying what San Diego has to offer, I don't care what anyone says, I don't get bored of going here over and over with my pass lol!"
2312,10/23/2013,5,"Our family really enjoyed SeaWorld. The Manta roller coaster was very fun and would love to ride it again. We went two different days during the week and got there right when the park opened. We went through several exhibits and rides without having to wait in line. About lunch time, it got pretty busy."
2313,6/7/2013,5,"I love Sea World!! Â I had the best time. Â All the shows are free once you are inside. Â We saw the Shamu show, the dolphin show, and the seal/otter show. Â The shows were great and I loved the park! I loved the turtles, the sharks, the walrus, the polar bear and the Atlantis ride was soooo fun!"
2314,4/6/2008,5,"Going to Sea World today for the umpteenth time. Â I am sure it will be a great day to see all of the shows and dolphins, sharks, and manatees. Â I will write more when I get home!!!"
2315,6/5/2011,5,"My daughter loves coming to SeaWorld! Â Beautiful park, amazing guest service, cool animals!"
2316,4/3/2013,4,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! More than disneyland or Knotts or Magic mountain or any other theme park! First time here with hubby over the weekend and we had soooo much fun! The shows are super adorable and enjoyable. I am amazed how well the fish and animals are trained. The rides are fun as well. Lines to buy tickets are long though so you are better off just paying online and picking the tickets up at the kiosk. You will find ice cream, drink, churros and other junky crap all over the place BUT definitely try their BBQ Turkey Leg and Ribs @the Shipwreck cafe! They are YUMMY! I would definitely go back!"
2317,8/14/2010,5,This place is sooo awesome!! The otter show + bat ray petting + shamu w/ the family = the best day everrrr =)
2318,5/5/2010,3,"First, I have to let out this gripe: Sea World is 2 words, not one. Since I couldn't find ""Sea World"" then I'm begrudgingly going to post under ""Seaworld."" Grr...I went here last week for the first time in 20+ years. Let me start with my disappointment. The Shamu ""Believe"" show left me in disbelief... WTH? Perhaps it's due to the tragedy that occurred at the Orlando location because just when I thought the show was starting to get good, it ended! :(Some of the new things (since the last time I had visited) I did enjoy:- Sesame 4D Show: Awesome! Yeah, I'm older than 5, but it's a good time for the whole fam - young and old.- Pets Rule: Oh man... I wish I could have brought my kitty to the show. She could learn a thing or two from the dogs, cats, birds and pig in that show. Oldie, but still a goodie: Clyde and Seymour Show is always great, and it's current. So, that's nice. I didn't enjoy it as much as the two shows I mentioned above, though. My only other suggestion is to not visit until after May 2010. There's a new dolphin show that's starting up soon. So, we're going to use our 2 for 1 tickets to make another trip once that show opens."
2319,8/26/2011,2,"The whole park felt outdated to me - like something out of the '70s. Â It also was a struggle for us to find things to do. Â There weren't that many exhibits, at least for the price of the ticket, and we weren't interested in the rides.The highlight of the day for us was feeding the dolphins. Â A real treat and not overpriced at all. Â We enjoyed the dolphin and Shamu shows as well, though we expected more. Â It seemed there was very little information or focus on the animals or behaviors being exhibited. Â The shows were enjoyable to watch, though I would have at least liked clear options on where to get more information (at the park, not online) about the animals, etc.The arctic facility was neat, but it seemed like the viewing options for the animals were not that great. Â We left after only 3.5 hours and saw all that we wanted to see and don't plan to go back.For a facility focused on conservation, there should be more dining options that are eco-friendly, eco-friendly serving pieces (plates, cups, forks, etc.), compost bins, sustainable and locally grown food, etc. Â I'm from the Bay Area so I expect these things from museums with similar eco-conscious missions.Ditto for all the plastic goodies and other wares for purchase - there should be more of a focus on sustainability and recycled materials."
2320,11/18/2008,2,"I never been so we decided to go. The whale show was cool, everyhing else was blah. But Â Not worth the money to get in they only have 4 shows and 1 is a dog act.??? what the F**K?!"
2321,4/29/2011,4,"I've been to two out of the three Sea Worlds in the U.S. The one in Florida is larger and has my particular favorite animal, the manatee, the San Diego Sea World is really very good. The parks are very clean, and the day we went it wasn't horribly crowded. Their animal shows (Shamoo, Dolphins) were very nice. Everything is very nice. Definately a nice place to go for the day."
2322,5/13/2013,5,"Honestly, one of my fave places in San Diego! $78 gets you an entire yearly pass!! You can't beat that!! The whales and animals are insanely gorgeous...soo many attractions and rides! The park does a great job of making everything look nice. I'm 25 and we go here every 2 weeks or so. Â It's free entertainment once you buy the pass and we have a fantastic time!! There's a beer garden for those that want that and I've been so many times and still haven't done even half of the attractions!!! Make sure to feed the sea lions...that is hilarious and so fun!! I love it here =)) The staff is extremely friendly too and the new Manta ride is actually up to par with Six Flags roller coasters....super fast and really fun!! Impressive. The video tunnel is like nothing I've ever seen before!!!"
2323,4/1/2013,4,we loved the shows especially the kids loved getting wet in Shamu show. Â The Manta ride was a big hit. Â We went first thing when we got in and the line wasn't too bad but when we went back later in the afternoon it was super long. Â One big complaint was the lines for food were insanely long. Â We waited til 3pm til the line went down a little. Â they need lunch options at the faster food stand so you don't spend an hour of your time in line. Â also the journey to atlantis kept breaking down and we never go to go and spent a lot of time waiting a few different times.
2324,8/10/2013,3,Bring your patience and wear sunblock. You are frying in the sun when you are sitting in the stadiums when you are waiting for the shows to start. Don't miss the SeaLions Live and SeaLions Tonite - Biff is hysterical and OP the otter is adorable. Overall SeaWorld does a good job. The down side is it's very crowded and bathrooms and other areas on the map are sometimes hard to find.
2325,12/27/2011,1,"Where to begin? Â Let's start with parking that costs $14, which I believe is more than what Disney charges at their parks. Â Next is the cost of admission, which is roughly $75 per adult. Â In reality people come here for two shows - the killer whales and dolphins. Â Both of those are packed with tons of people.I have three fundamental issues with SeaWorld:1) See the movie ""The Cove"", then go watch the dolphin show at SeaWorld. Â You'll be shocked at how little space the dolphins have. Â The pools they use to ""store"" the dolphins when shows are not in session are VERY small. Â These are animals used to swimming 40+ miles a day, yet are crammed into a small place for our amusement and the profit of SeaWorld. Â 2) The main shows are more theatrical / less educational than they used to be. Â The dolphin show was 40% acrobatic performances & diving without a dolphin in site. Â They also don't allow the trainers in the water any more during the Shamu shows (since the whales have killed a few trainers over the years at various parks).3) Let's ignore any ethical considerations for just a moment and assume that the animals are living in luxury - this place is VERY expensive. Â $14 for parking, $11 for a refillable soda, the list goes on. Â Yes, you can only see these animals in captivity in a few select locations in the US and this is one of them, but still..."
2326,2/17/2010,3,i am in love with marine life...seaworld is easily the best place to go to see water animals. Â i love seaworld for that reason alone....HOWEVER....prices are insane. Â the shows are not as charming and quirky as they used to be. Â and the rides aren't really that amazing.i love coming here to just stare at the aquariums. Â i wish that shark sleepover was for adults too.
2327,7/30/2008,4,"Sea world is such a fun place to be at. The food is great and there are plenty of exhibits. The only thing Seaworld needs are more rides, but other than that, Seaworld is amazing and a must go to vacation spot!"
2328,4/14/2013,4,"Seaworld was awesome. I went for my first time ever yesterday. I was a little skeptical, since I had always heard terrible things about how different places treat the animals. I was reassured though, because every trainer I saw seemed to genuinely care about the animals they were working with, plus they were all extremely knowledgable and would talk to the kids if they asked questions. We saw the ""One Ocean"" show, which was in Shamu Stadium and had the orca whales. Apparently one of the whales just had a baby in February, so they let the baby whale follow the mom around in the show which was adorable. Seems like an awesome place for kids. My boyfriend and I are in our mid twenties, and don't have kids, but we had an AWESOME time. Seaworld also has alcoholic beverages, which I thought was cool. They also give active military complimentary admission, which is nice. The park is small enough that you can easily see everything in one day. All in all, a great time---would recommend to any animal lover of any age."
2329,5/26/2015,5,"We went three times during our 4 day vacation!!! Â My family was in San Diego for 4 days and I had purchased a 7 day 3 park package. Â We spent all day at Sea World on the first day. Â The killer whales and dolphins got us soaking wet as we were sitting in the front rows. Â It felt like someone was pouring bathtub full of water on us. Â LOL. Â We still didn't get to see all the shows. Â The second day we went to the Safari Zoo and we were very disappointed so we went back to the Sea world and spent another day there catching the Killer Whale show again and watching the dolphins again. Â My kids could not get enough of them. Â And the interaction with the cleaning fish was a lot of fun for everyone. Â On the 3rd day we went to the San Diego Zoo which was fantastic. Â And on the final day before going to the airport, we went to the Sea World again and watched 11 o'clock Â Pets Rule show which was very entertaining. Â We watched the whales and dolphins again and played with the cleaning fish before heading to the airport. Â  The Orcas are just magnificent animals. Â and all the rehabilitation and rescuing the Sea World does impressed me as well."
2330,7/3/2009,2,"For starters, I think Sea World is way too expensive to be worth paying for. Luckily, I get tickets for free and often. My favorite part of going to Sea World is just seeing the fish in the many aquariums throughout the park. It's a good way to see all the different types of sea life that the world has to offer. Always enjoyable is the manitee exhibit. My wife and I can just sit there for a half hour watching the manitees twist and roll and eat giant heads of cabbage as other fish swim around them. I even like the shows around the park with the Sea Lion and Otter show always being a fave since the days before Busch owned the parks.What I don't like (and I realize that this is how they justify the price) are the rides that turned Sea World from an aquarium into a theme park. I've heard complaints the opposite way...that there just aren't enough rides like the one in Orlando. Fuck that. Sea World was so much better when HBJ owned the parks. The rides are a disctraction and an eyesore. (I never thought I would side with the hoity toity residents of Pt. Loma ) What was wrong with just coming up with new enclosures? Those are things that would captivate the imagination moreso than a ride would. Moving on to the food...now, the food near Shipwreck Rapids smells terrific. I haven't ever had it, but props to the aroma. I have had eats at the area near the shark encounter. If you're gonna charge Disneyland prices for food, it should be good (Well, the food at Disney is pretty shitty too now). I had a sandwich that looked great in the description, but was nothing other than a cold cut sandwich.....you know...just like the ones HBJ's version os Sea World used to let people bring in to eat in the picnic areas (even Busch allowed it for a while). The plus....those paper straws are good so the local birdlife and other animals don't choke on them. One more big plus....even in comparison to the Zoo, the merchandise for Sea World is still relatively reasonable. Oh and that fudge shop has some pretty good fudge. A lot of the enclosures are awesome like Rocky Point Preserve, Wild Arctic (personal fave) and the Killer Whale area. My wife is a big fan of Forbidden Reef , where all the rays are. I like it too, but get over it pretty quickly. I remember when that area had the pearl divers and there used to be some strange beluga whale show. The rides they do have are just all right. The Journey To Atlantis is really not worth the wait and is constantly breaking down. Shipwreck Rapids is a decent ride as well, but better when you don't have to wait in line for it."
2331,4/7/2008,2,"Em, not that i don't love seeing the same animals over and over, but this is kind of a lame park for a 21 year old to go. Â I mean, the deal is good- go once and you get the year for free, but even with that hard to bring myself there."
2332,4/13/2011,3,"If you go, try to visit this place in a weekday, early in the morning. It's a big place and it gets crowded. I got a yearly membership once. It was nice but it requires a lot of walking between exhibits. I didn't renew my membership. San Diego has so many places were you can enjoy seeing wild animals, that it didn't make sense to me to support massive animal enclosures. May be better for children above 5 so they can really get to enjoy the Sesame Street Bay of Play."
2333,7/7/2011,4,"My 4 & 5 year olds are loving this place, not just Plaza Sesame. Â They cried on Atlantis, but now are proud ""survivors"". Â They love the live shows, all of them (the movie spoofs with the sea lions at night go over their heads, but they still enjoy them), the touch tide pools, feeding sea lions, the beluga whales & polar bears on the Wild Arctic, and so on. Â We make the 110-mile ride 3-4 times a year (buy a day get the rest of the year free till end of August). Â  They also love going to the Souplantation about 2 miles away. Â Avoid the holiday crowds. Â Great medicine for the soul, and body. Â  Wish it were closer."
2334,3/11/2013,4,"I just love this place. I cant help myself! The shows and the exhibits are great. I go about 6 times a year and I see new things I hadnt seen before everytime. This last time I saw stingrays and 4 eyed fish in the fresh water tanks. I didnt even know things like that lived in lakes! haha. My favorite places are the shamu, dolphin, and shark encounters. They all swim right up to the glass and you get a great look at the beautiful creatures! One of my favorite places is also the penguin encounter. On hot days sometimes I get a tall draft beer and sit in there and watch the penguins for an hour. They are very entertaining and they show videos with alot of cool facts. I love coming here for date nights as well as with my nephew.2 different experiences but both very memorable. Id reccommend it to anyone! Bring lots of water with you to save on buying soft drinks and definitely pack a lunch. The food is not so good. I would love to see them put in a great restaurant where lovies can enjoy a romantic meal before fireworks =) that would make it a 5 star park!"
2335,5/24/2011,4,"I love SeaWorld. Â Have been a fan since I was a little kid and will definitely be a place for me to bring my kids. Â I love the shows and the rides. Â It's different from other types of amusement parks because it is less stressful and not as crowded. Â Maybe it's just me because I don't like waiting in long lines to get onto a ride. Â But SeaWorld is definitely a place to visit, if you are in town."
2336,10/16/2007,4,"10/9/07-10/10/07: Even as an adult I enjoyed this place, it was my first time here with several kids and to some degree it was nice seeing them have fun here. I don't know if I can handle anything more than two days here, but I'm sure they mix things up for the locals. The shows are good, we saw them all, it is really impressive how well they train all the animals. My parents-in-law- paid for everything, I think would be alittle more critical if the cash was flying out of my wallet (I'm getting frugal), food is expensive here ($150 for 8 adults and 4 kids) and mostly comprised of fast food. We didn't have problems bringing in some food (kid's snacks and drinks), it would be difficult to bring in anything more than that."
2337,9/6/2007,2,"I imagine SeaWorld is a lot better when you have kids. Â Since we don't, my wife and I weren't too impressed. Â The price is pretty ridiculous for what you get. Â The Shamu show we saw was pure cheese. Â It's as though they believe seeing these whales will be a life changing experience. Â It's not. Â I enjoyed the penguin exhibit and the Atlantis coaster was neat, once I finally got on it. Â Like another reviewer here, it was closed when we arrived in the morning and didn't open until mid-afternoon."
2338,6/28/2008,2,"My first visit here and it was pretty Â unimpressive, unless you really love shopping for useless animal-themed crap that's all made in China. Â I'd say the ration of stores to animal exhibits/spectacles is 4:1, plus you have to walk through a concession on the way out of pretty much every exhibit. Â And there's no shade... what's up with that? Â Sea World's been there forever -- surely they've had time to cultivate some large trees?We went to the Shamu show, and my husband couldn't stop laughing at the chants and bizarre theme ""Believe"". Â What does ""believe"" have to do with orcas? Â The show was like what I imagine a Christian rock concert/tent revival would be like. Â At the end they brought up some kid, CJ, who said his dream was to be a football player. Â The emcee/lead trainer (?) gave him some inspirational hoohah and he got to toss a couple of fish into Shamu's mouth. Â Believe!If we go back, which I doubt, we'll stick with the kiddie area, which was the only place my kids really liked. Â My daughter's still talking about the ""blue jumpy house"" -- next time we'll crash some kid's party at Fiesta Island and kept our $150. Â The belugas were cool, though, I do have to admit that."
2339,7/20/2011,3,"the tickets are up to $70, parking for a car is $14. Â It is worth going for both adults and kids if it the first time because of its unique shows. Â not every place has whale and dolphin shows. Â i went once as a kid and once as an adult. Â back then the shows use to be better, now it involves too much theatrics from people in the show and not so much from the animals. Â kids would definitely love it, especially the sesame street bay of play. adults would enjoy, again the first time. it is not a place you would want to go once a year. Â it is not as big as you might think, if you get there when the doors open and leave when it closes you should be able to go through th entire park, including the big rides (journey to atlantis and shipwreck rapids) and the major shows. Â if you have to skip a show i would say to skip the pets one."
2340,6/6/2012,2,"SeaWorld is getting more and more lame every year. Take back Dolphin Discovery and get rid of Blue Horizons. I remembered how cute the dolphins were and the trainers joking around with them and being pulled in the water. Now, there are lame acrobatics diving into the water for like 3/4 of the show. This is so not cool, if you want acrobatics, go to the Cirque de la Mar show. Much better and funny. Next, you should change the story for Pet Rules. The animals are cute, but it's boring watching them do the same thing every time. The sea lion show is still funny, no matter what. THEY ARE SO CUTE!! Shamu show used to be very interesting until that incident with the trainer. Now the trainers just dance, not knowing what to do next. The food are way overpriced, if you are going to Seaworld, being a younger sibling and a stroller. Let them sit, making them hide the outside food. That way, no one will notice. You know, the toys that Seaworld sells won't last a day. It's those cheap ass toys made from China. Little kids often play with excessive force, yet you are selling them for 10X the price that you can buy at the 99 Cent store. The rides are OK, Manta was fun but I feel sorry for the larger people. I once saw a person not fitting in a seat and had to be removed from the ride. Dude seriously, are you picking on larger people? You design a coaster with tiny safety restraints. All other rides are OK for them, but not this one? Even SixFlags coasters fit them perfectly. More and more people are being attached to the arcade. I'm sorry to say, but I am one of them. LOWER THE FREAKING PRICE FOR A TICKET!!! NO ONE WANTS TO PAY THAT MUCH TO ENTER A PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING IS A RIPOFF. Parking prices went up again. It's not what it is 3 years ago, it has changed a lot Â ever since. Seaworld was fun 3 years ago until they ruined it. BRING BACK THE OLD SEAWORLD!!"
2341,1/1/2011,4,"I went here with my family. This place is so well built and they have many good shows going on , for dolphins, shamus, sea lions, I got a chance to see them all and they were so well performed. I went here at Dec 30, it was really crowded with families, I didnt try the rides though. But you have to see the performances and try to manage the schedule of your whole day. You will need to prepare of 1 day full to try to visit them all. The parking space was pretty crowded . If you got Â chance to visit it in between a year, get annual pass instead 1visit, it's only 5 bucks difference and you might need 2 visits to try and see and enjoy the seaworld."
2342,1/11/2011,4,Lots of fun on an amazing day! Hit it during the week so small crowds! Great place to be with the family! I would recommend eating prior to your visit since most of the food places suck!
2343,2/17/2011,4,"Place can be a bit expensive as you go through out the day, but I think this is something everyone expects when they go to an amusement park. All of the shows and exhibits are great. I really love the new show with the dogs, cats, pigs and birds. It is amazing all of the trick they can teach those little guys to do."
2344,12/24/2010,3,"Aesthetically this place is top notch. But I like to review things in a whole. Looking at each exhibits threes a little plaque with some literature about what you're looking at. It really didn't say much. It was pretty much more or less a brief synopsis, which is actually kind of disappointing. I would go back just to see the animals but I definitely found it to be more visually appealing than informative. But, a day trip here with the family or a school field trip is a must, you actually can learn something."
2345,2/24/2006,4,"Definitely a fun spot to take your kids...see all the shows, the marine life, the shark tank, and I believe they have a ride now. Â And with fun pass (buy one admission and get in free the rest of the year - I am sure there are blackout days though) it can be worth your while. Â Personally, I would opt for the zoo, but that's just my opinion."
2346,3/22/2013,4,"Just visited Seaworld for the first time in a long time. Â My fiance and I were visiting town and decided to go on a trip here. Â First off, tickets are a little steep, especially since we were just coming for the day. Â I know that you get the rest of the year free, but it would be nice to have a discounted ticket as I can't forsee us making many trips out to the park. Â In the same vein, 80 bucks is not bad for a season ticket when considering how much some other parks charge. Â Anyways, I have to say, I am really impressed with the attractions they have added since the last time I was here. Â There were a few new shows and of course the Shamu show was outstanding. Â The park had very friendly service members and it was very clean. Â Why does Seaworld not get five stars? Â Simple, there is far too much vast unused space inside the park to call the experience amazing. Â I see that there is a curve to impress the youngsters, but it would be nice if there were some attractions geared more towards adults. Â Also, some more thrilling rides could really improve the experience. Â The park looks to have enough room to build a sincerely good ride, and they would make the process more well rounded. Â Also, I think some of the restaurant choices could be better. Â I definitely love the shows and see what everything is about, just please the adults just as much as the kids (we are the ones spending the money, right?)."
2347,3/20/2011,4,I have not been here for 20 years and I was so excited to enjoy the day and we did. The park was well kept up and very clean. The shows were on time and entertaining. Yes a bit cheesy but I even laughed. I did miss the trainers swimming with the whales but the tricks were still fun to watch. We actually had a decent tasting meal some pasta and pizza that I felt it was a good value. Usually I do not have luck with theme park food but I was pleasantly surprised. Overall we enjoyed the day and are looking forward to the late summer nights.
2348,4/8/2008,5,"We love Seaworld for all their great shows. Â We see them over and over again. Â They are always different - after all the animals are the stars and depending on what they decide to do - they are constantly changing. Â Try to get to shows about 15 minutes early for good seats in Â busy times. Â We did the behind the scenes tour and were a little disappointed. Â I guess we got what we paid for!! Â Buy a passport membership if you plan to frequent the park. Â You will get free parking ($10 a day), discounts on food, purchases and tours. Â Much better deal in the long run than the fun pass. Â You only need to buy one passport membership per family though."
2349,6/19/2011,5,Had fun felt like I was a kid again. Felt like I had more fun than my son did. Prices for food and souvenirs weren't that bad compared to what they usually charge here in Vegas.
2350,6/30/2006,3,"This place is cool to go every several years. They are really trying to spice it up with adding rides, and FINALLY a new Shamu show! I just don't see how they can charge $52 for admission!!! That is the same price as Disneyland, and you can do SO MUCH MORE at Disneyland. Great for kids though."
2351,7/5/2008,3,"i love marine animals , so this is a good place for me. Â i love seeing them so much that i go regardless of the blatant commercialism...the gift stores...the pepsi advertisement in the sea lion show..when the otter runs out with a pepsi and music plays and the host talks about pepsi for no reason Â (that pepsi plug has been in the show ever since i can remember, so at least 16 years). Â my other issue with it is that i really really wonder if those animals are happy. Â it's so hard to tell. Â i mean it's nice that shamu has a big pool but he is meant to be in the OCEAN. Â it is so different. Â and at the seal exhibit, the seals barely have any space. Â i asked an employee if the seals sleep there and he said yes and i got sad. Â it is really not enough space for those seals to live in. Â  and then there's the sea lion feeding area, Â where the only thing that those sea lions do all day is sit around the edge of the pool and bark at people for food. Â they beg all day. Â that is not what sea lions do in nature. Â seaworld pretends like its environments are natural but the park is there for the tourists and that is obvious. Â it's there for the animals too, a little bit, but if it was really there for the animals, the sea lions wouldn't have to preform to make people laugh, the whales wouldn't have to swim in circles splashing people all day and the sharks wouldn't have to swim in a tiny pool with a tube going through it wtih people staring up at them all day. Â it's great that people get to see these animals so up close but it could be way more natural and way less touristy. Â so yeah. Â i love love love seeing marine animals up close but i don't think they are that happy, and i think the park is there 75% for the tourists and only 25% for the animals. Â  hence the three stars.oh yeah and the chant and hand motions in the believe shamu show are so culty that it is scary and weird."
2352,7/1/2006,4,"Not only a fun place, but a place that you can interact with marine animals. I have been going there, on and off, since I was a kid. Yes, they haven't done that much over the years, but it is still fun. Now that they have added a show kind of like Cirque Du Soleil, it just makes it better."
2353,4/27/2013,5,"be ready to get wet... :)fun place and wonderful experience. must see all .. dolphins, whales, penguin. shamu show.i visit this place last year."
2354,4/27/2011,4,We live here in San Diego & visit often... Love the summer night shows!
2355,12/30/2010,5,"The sealions rock your world! They are my absolute favorite there! The entrance fees are pretty cheap considering its around 60 for a full year versus other amusement parks. The animals there are all displayed in their natural habitats and very active. It's a very entertaining experience. My favorites, the sealion show is beyond adorable and entertaining. Sea world kicks butt! :)"
2356,9/8/2010,2,If you like the circus your'e going to like Seaworld. If you like the museum you're going to hate it here. What are animals? Are they performing circus acts or creatures which deserve research and respect? Kiddies may like to see killer whales jump through hoops. Adults should be mortified.
2357,4/18/2011,4,I am a big fan of everything but the parking. The shows are great. I especially recommend the dolphin show and the walrus and otter show. The special events are awesome and if you get one of the year passes it is very affordable. If you have kids the playground area is a godsend.
2358,1/3/2011,4,"All and all, Sea World is an awesome place to bring the kids. A must is the sky-tower, where the views of San Diego are spectacular. Don't miss the dolphin show, and of course a trip to Sea World wouldn't be complete without a visit to Shamu stadium."
2359,4/18/2010,3,This place is definitely overrated. Many attractions closed. Highlights are the shamu and 4d sesame street show. Shamu show was very inspiring and a must watch of course. Otherwise everything else is ordinary with your local zoo if not better. Now I'm rating it mainly with the cost of the ticket and what you get for it. It also rained momentarily and they closed the attraction until it stopped raining. For me sea world will be a one time visit for my 3 yr old.
2360,10/20/2008,2,"Won 2 free passes to Sea World and thankfully I did!! I guess when you're a kid EVERYTHING seems big and great, but coming back as an adult, I was disappointed. First- $61 I think is way over priced for what you get. Very bare on the animals and the ones that are there are in ""habitats"" totally not close viewing friendly. You can pay 3x less at the zoo and see way more animals up close. Ate at shipwreck cafe and it food was blah. My boyfriend and I got 2 burger combos and a side of cake + a drink and cost $32. I don't mind paying money for food, but it needs to be GOOD food. Got though the park pretty quickly, not much to do. Skipped the shows so I guess if you're into that stuff then that will take up more time. Definitely for kids 1-12 yrs old. Overall okay place. The Zoo is much better tho'"
2361,10/27/2008,4,"The world of the Sea. Â Wouldn't it be cool if everyone who went there was allowed to swim with the fishes, not in a mafia badboy sort of fashion, but in an actual Island of the Blue Dolphins way? Â I vote yes. Â But in the meantime, I'll settle for what they let me get away with. Â The cones in the parking lot are my enemy. Â All the animals are sweet! Â I feel like Brian Fellowes when I'm there, cuz I never knew how much a swimming, ugly looking creature can make you feel good inside. Â I like that we are the top of the food chain. Â Some other world has a Land World, and all the creatures of the sea pay their parking fees and use their fun passes they bought at Costco of the Pacific to come watch Manmu, the swimming human. Â We can do this! Â Seriously, though- for now this park is operated by Anheuser-Busch. Â yes, the makers of Budweiser have theme parks. Â Although the European company InBev acquired the rights to AB, they haven't shut down the parks yet. Â Thanks, Europeans. Â So, since it is run by Bud, there are big giant horses taking up a lot of land at ""sea"" world. Â Wow! Â Who was the marketing genius behind that one? Â Hmm, parents love beer, and our company has Clydesdales, so let us use up 1/3 of the water themed park to show off our equestrian command units. Â Either way, the actual sea life they got there is fun to watch. Â And the Kids love Elmo's bay of play. Â When I was young, I think they called it Captain Kidd's play zone or something like that. Â More like Captain Crying Kidd's bonk your head and get unusually soaked zone. Â Thx 4 th mmries. Â Who doesn't love a killer whale? Â The fiercest predator in the world (non-human) can also jump as high as the top row, and show off his junk! Â He will also let you put your head in his mouth. Â as long as you don't have fish on your face you should be safe."
2362,12/30/2008,3,"2.5 stars for the park and 5 stars for just the penguins!The only major thing to see here are the penguins. I don't know where else you can see emperor penguins in the US. The actual exhibit is a little sad because there are so many penguins of all different species packed into one small space. I'm sure they are fine, but just seems a little cramped. My husband got me a ""Penguin Encounter"" tour that allowed us to meet a penguin - this was an extra cost on top of the admission fee. So we went to the kitchen and they brought out a penguin for us to touch and see up close. That was pretty cool, but the tour seemed a little over sold. They advertised it as being 1 hour but most of the time you aren't meeting the penguin, you are being lectured to or having to endure some really cheesy jokes. Also I thought that we would meet 2 penguins instead of just one type. We did get to go into the actual exhibit that most people have to see behind a window. It was like hanging out in a fridge but it was totally worth it. You got to see the penguins so up close. It was something that you can not easily experience so that was really special. My only grip is that it was only for a couple of minutes. The rest of the park was really so-so. The shows were lame, but I am sure little kids would love it.. I didn't go see Shamu, but I went to the Dolphin and Sea Lion show, both not memorable. I liked seeing all the other sea life, but I generally thought that you could get the same thing at a nice aquarium like Monterrey Bay Aquarium without the steep price admission price of $65 bucks plus $12 bucks to park and amusement park atmosphere. All-in-all, the penguins made my day."
2363,11/17/2010,4,"Used to love this place as a kid, running around the whole park getting lost from your parents, the shows, and exciting animals. But now as an adult, I pretty much just go here to eat lunch and the FUNNEL cake. Â Sometimes catch a show or two but all in all great place to take the family."
2364,9/19/2009,3,"My cousin put's out a Facebook update that she's headed to Sea World with her kids if anyone wants to go. Me being a kid at heart and having not Â yet been to Sea World (here, I went to the one in Orlando when I was a kid), responded, count me in. We got there around 6, when it was cooling down and a bunch of the tourons were leaving. Wear your comfy shoes, as there is a lot of walking. We saw the stingray and eel exhibit, saw some sea otters and dolphins, watched the orca show and rode the gondola and tower rides. (no rollercoaster as the kids are too young for that one) I admit feeling a little guilty pleasure throughout the evening at seeing the animals. I feel guilty as these are captive animals and some of them I have seen in the wild (obviously the best way to see them). But I do realize that not everyone lives or grew up near an ocean and took it for granted that a day on the boat or an afternoon at a local seaside restaurant would most likely provide views of dolphins at play. It was pretty amazing to see the magnitude of the orca whales in all their magnificent glory less than 100 feet from me. I felt guilt when I saw that one of them had fin flop, which comes from being in captivity too long. If you or your children will never really have an opportunity to see these animals in the wild, then it is a must see. I would hope that responsible parents would try to factor in some educational lessons along with their outing and teach their kids that this is not a natural way of life for these animals.If you are a family of 4 or 3 or even 2, prepare to offer an arm and a leg for this venue. They are not cheap! I wound up buying a yearlong pass because it was only $14 more than the day pass and I get free parking when I visit. I live nearby so I will make sure to use it. Check their website for special deals, coupons and discounts. Also check online, you might find some money savers there too. The food is overpriced as to be expected, but at least they do Â have a healthy alternatives cafe, for those that are looking for a healthier option. And for the adults there is beer available, there may be more, but that was what we had. I plan to go back and check out the roller coaster and some more of the exhibits. I will update when I do."
2365,11/14/2010,3,"I would have given it 2 stars but my lunch was really good! I have a bias I grew up going to the Sea World in Orlando and I can't help but compare the two. Â If you have been to Orlando, SD Sea World seems second rate. Â  Its not bad it just isn't on the same level as the other one. Â I got my ticket as part of a go pass so I was really happy with the price if I get a go pass again I would go back if only for the BBQ chicken lunch I had. Â This isn't really that good for adults but I think kids would love it."
2366,7/27/2007,4,"this was my first time at sea world. Â its a bit pricey for a poor recent college grad, but we were able to get a AAA discount (10 dollars) so that helped. Â i think we found a couple other coupons online so it'd be worth it to try and google some coupons. Â and they have good deals on getting season passes or a fun pass, or a 2 for 1 deal they have going on right now until the end of the year, and the AAA discount applies to these as well, which is pretty sweet.we were able to see most of what we wanted to see in one day (from 3-11), but there was definitely more to do if we wanted to fork over more money (i.e. feeding and interacting w/the animals).its fun to be at a place bustling with young kids...seeing them get excited about being there almost made me more excited (i do have a strong love for kids, so that might factor into it =)). we caught a lot of the shows/rides:1. shamu believe : Â this show was cute, and a good time to get pics of shamu and the orca whales. Â 2. cirque de la mer : Â one word- lame. Â i didn't really understand what was going on in the beginning....this show is definitely geared towards the youngins...and even then, i might be more scared of than entertained by the clown-like people of amphibia. 3. dolphin discovery: this was a funny and entertaining show. Â definitely worth seeing. 4. r.l. stine's haunted lighthouse 4D: Â this seemed sort of random to me, but it was the 4D part that attracted us to it. Â we were lucky and caught a short line. Â the wait doesnt seem to be too long tho as they have a large theater and showings every 25 minutes. Â the story was cute...but its r.l. stine so ya gotta endure some jumpy moments if youre afraid of scare at any sort of level.5. shamu rocks: Â this was in the evening, and was lit up in pretty colors...definitely better than shamu believe, but not as good for taking pics. catch the 9:30 showing and it ends right when the fireworks start. Â  its a nice way to end the show. :)6: ""journey to atlantis"" ride: Â we tried to go earlier but it was shut down temporarily for technical difficulties. Â this is one of the few rides there, and one of the fewer that doesn't cost extra. Â definitely worth going on, altho note that you must take your belongings on with you so prepare for that. 7. wild arctic: Â this was an awesome helicopter simulation. Â the line wasn't too long when we were there, so it was worth the short but exciting ride :) we didnt have enough patience to wait the 90 min for the shipwreck rapids.we ate at calypso bay, which had decent portions of chicken pr ribs for a decent price. overall, it was a fun experience. Â dont forget to see the manatees and penguins! during the summer its hard to see the penguins tho because its their winter, so they have the lights dimmed in the exhibit :( Â remember to bring a water bottle to keep hydrated (they have water fountains all over the park that you can refill on if you want to save $$ from having to buy overpriced souvenir cups."
2367,4/15/2008,5,"I just had my first visit to Sea World in almost 20 years!! Â I think I was about 7 or 8 the last time I went...and I don't remember much of it. (LOL) We rode 'Atlantis' and I got soaked!! It was AWESOME!! I can't wait to go again, and hopefully next time, I'll keep track of time so I can see the Shamu show, the dolphin show, play more games AND do the beer tasting. :)"
2368,11/10/2009,5,i love sea world!!! i really heart the polar bears and seals!! when we came here last saturday the weather was a bit cold and gloomy :( but that meant less people and less lines! haha~ i also love how sea world is so eco friendly even their straws and silverware is made out of plants! since we purchased a two day pass we will come back very soon =)
2369,1/7/2009,4,"I went on an overcast day and got slightly sunburnt, but it was worth it. Â The few rides were fun, the shows were funny, and the exhibits were educational if you like to read. Â But I probably won't go back for a while."
2370,3/7/2009,2,"So this place gets a lot of hype, and like most amusement parks, it is just eye candy devoid of any real value. The shows are very contrived, the food ridiculously overpriced (like most amusement parks) and rides kind of anti-climactic. Shamu show was like watching a really really bad Disney movie. Â I don't have children, but if I did I would prefer to take them to the zoo to see a great variety of animals in a more natural habitat."
2371,4/19/2009,5,"We visited for the first time ever on Easter Sunday and boy did we hit the jackpot, it was not that crowded at allMy kids loved the Sesame street area. Â My daughter is in love with Abby Cadabby and we could not find her doll anywhere except on line but Sea world's Sesame street gift shop had her and now my daughter and niece have their very own Abby. Â My kids both enjoyed meeting Big Bird and Elmo and taking pictures with them. Â My husband and I enjoyed seeing all of the animals and the shows. Â The dolphin show was neat and we saw the night killer whale show and it was spectacular followed by fireworks. Â Time just flew by and we didn't realize that we were in the park for 9 hours. Â Food is pricey and not the best of course and the souvenirs cost and arm and a leg but my whole family had a blast and it was worth every penny."
2372,1/6/2013,3,"Well, we have funcards. BUT we are from Europe and have guests coming at a regular basis. I find it a rip-off that they have to pay for a day what we pay for a year! It would be nice if they had a one-day ticket at a more reasonable price. The kid playground is good. Food is EXTREMELY AWFUL EAT BEFOREHAND!! Seriously, food is really yucky and crappy in Seaworld. I find it awfully commercial but my kids seem to like it. However, we will not renew for 2014, I think.. The snow world was very disappointing too - they told my 4 year old that she could not go on the little hill, because she was not yet 5. In Europe, she took far bigger hills at 3.. Hysteria and fear of lawsuits ruins a lot."
2373,8/9/2012,4,"I visited SeaWorld a little over a month ago with a friend. It was a tremendous amount of fun. I haven't been here on over two years. We got the Fun Cards that give you unlimited entries to SeaWorld for the rest of the year. Such a great deal. Only $73 (Which is the price of a ticket normally). There are a lot of great attractions to see. The turtle exhibit was quite amazing. As was the shark encounter. Don't miss the SLL show. (Sea Lions Live) It is incredibly entertaining and very cute. Great for children and adults. I need to devise a plan to kidnap that otter and have him be my best friend. But I fear he will miss his Sea Lion Brethren too much. Another thing you should consider doing is the ""Dine with Shamu"" experience. Its incredible. There are two orca whales about 5ft. away from you performing tricks while you are enjoying your delicious meal. I am a vegetarian so I was fearing there wouldn't be a lot of options for me to pick from to eat, but I was pleasantly surprised, and my stomach and I left happily. It is a little pricey at about $40 per adult. The children's price is a little cheaper but I can't recall the rates. There was only a few things I wasn't happy about. The Manta was closed. I was very excited to ride it and I guess they were experiencing technical difficulties. Also, the whole day I was looking for the manatees and most of the staff told me they still had them. The manatees were my favorite part of SeaWorld. They are such beautiful creatures, But I digress. I kept asking the staff and they kept sending me places where they weren't. They had no idea what they were talking about. Finally, someone informed me that the manatee exhibit had been moved to a different SeaWorld. I was devastated. Also, there weren't any polar bears when I went the ""Wild Arctic"" exhibit. All in all it was a great experience and I'll be going again soon."
2374,4/17/2009,4,"This was also part of my San Diego vacation a couple years ago. I've been here many times before though, as a kid.My boyfriend and I had lots of fun...but the weather was kinda weird although it was summer. In the afternoon, it was on and off overcast and sunny. I like how their rapids ride uses salt water (I'm guessing actually ocean water)...I like this because it's not reused, gross, smelly water like other rapids rides and other theme parks. Therefore, you don't smell like gross, smelly water after the ride and throughout the whole day. We made the mistake of going on the atlantis ride in the afternoon...being as we get cold very, very, very easily. (I seriously thing I have problems generating warmth!) Of course, right after we get off the ride it becomes overcast again...and we're soaking wet...and hoping there is a spot of sunlight somewhere where we can stand and soak in some warmth. Nay. We really wanted to stay for the nighttime Shamu show...but...if we were to stay, I think we would have gotten really sick because we were freezing! And we were pretty satisfied with the other shows and stuff we had seen throughout the day...so no biggie."
2375,6/15/2009,5,"It's been awhile (20 years) since I visited this place and I'm sure glad I came back. Â For a summer Sunday this place was not as packed as I thought it would be. Â My Bf and I and a couple of friends were able to have good seats at every show just by getting there 15 minutes before it started. Â All shows are a must see especially the sea lion show. If you live in San Diego I suggest you get a passport. Â You have unlimited visits for the whole year, parking is free everytime you go, and you get 10% discounts off everything at the park. Â  The exhibits are nice too. Just be careful when you go to the Wild Arctic exhibit and choose to go on the simulator ride. Â It may make you queasy and a little dizzy. Â Nonetheless, I'm glad I ended the weekend at this place. Â I'd defintely come back."
2376,3/24/2009,3,"My first time going here and I loved it. Â It's great for all ages. Â The only downside was that only two big main rides were there, atlantis and rapids. Â There's lots to see and do. Â Something for everyone. Â I went when it was a little chilly, definetely would've been better in warmer weather. Â I took another star away because I waiting in line and got on rapids and then they made us get off automatically and told us to leave because the ride was being shut down. Â We came back later and had to wait again... wait wasn't too crazy though. Â I got a fun card, me and my bf will be coming back again."
2377,7/28/2012,2,"Man I thought it was me getting older and not enjoying Sea World because of that but my father and others were just as disappointed. I have video and memories of MUCH longer and entertaining shows from Sea World 10-15 years ago than what I saw the other day. I went 0/4 with shows, every single one stunk hardcore. The dolphin show was more of a play now with acrobats dressed as birds and very little dolphin interaction. Shamu was really short and nothing really happened, Seamore and Clyde which I LOVED as a kid is now SLL and while the main host was extremely funny, the show itself didn't really go anywhere and the walrus is gone :( I then went to the 4D theatre and got to watch Sesame Street in 4D which was mostly sing along. The FX felt like an afterthought. I've seen A Bug's Life 4D in Orlando @ Animal Kingdom and was much more impressed. Arctic Wild was an okay ride, but even the shark and penguin exhibits seem so lackluster now. The 2nd penguin tank is full of birds that according to the signs reads that they might ""remind"" us of what penguins look like. Sad!The best part was the Calypso BBQ food. Insanely expensive like everything else but it was delicious and I enjoyed every second of it."
2378,5/4/2008,3,dude fuck the rides...why arent the kids all about the animals?? dont they realize this is like their only chance to see penguins that close? or touch a dolphin? or a stingray? these opportunities dont happen often...trust me. i look. lol ;) seriously rides do not belong around animals...i like turtles
2379,11/19/2008,3,"I like Wild Arctic. Â I'd only go here again if I had a child. Â I remember that I had never seen so many Chinese people in one place before. Â My niece loved Shamu and the sea lion show, but not much changes here in several years. Â We only go here when relatives visit."
2380,7/10/2007,3,"Not that big fan of Sea World, I went because I had never been and wanted to know what all the fuzz was about. Â When someone asked me if I've been to Sea World and I said no, they're just shocked and say ""oh my god, really you haven't been"". Â It just depends on what you're into, I mean yeah its an amusement park but just not my type of amusement park."
2381,12/14/2007,4,"Four Stars for ""Sea World""! Â Well, I have to stand on the side of great, and not so great. Â I like seaworld when you have a pass. Â You don't feel rushed, you see what you want to see, do what you want to do, and what you miss, you come back and see it later! Â The down side is if you don't have a pass! Â You feel rushed running from one part of the part to the other, and trying your best to get seats that really you can see from any part of the stadiums to people who have strollers, and what nots...so it gets a bit overwhelming. Â Like I said get a pass if you live in S.D. Â You get great seats everytime, your not rushed, and a great time when only spending part of the day!"
2382,7/29/2012,3,"I have to say that I always have fun when I come to sea world. The place is over crowded and I dont think there are enough shows, yet the one's that they do have are nice. I have to say one very annoying thing about Sea World is that I am a Platinum member this means that there is special seating and front row parking. I am annoyed that sometimes there are people who just sit in platinum seating and do not get checked.Why am I paying extra money to have these seats and parking when its not always being enforced. I feel like I could have bought a regular pass and just sat wherever.They have checked me a few times then I see people not being checked with regular passes crowding the seating that I am paying extra for it is very annoying. WIth as much money as sea world makes they have enough money to hire someone to check guests in the platinum seating area. I find it also offensive to be checked and then see others not checked . Is it because I am not dressed up? The parking annoys me to because some of the times there is no body checking the preffered parking . IF you go in they dont patrol to see if you had preffered parking or not so its a 50/50 chance if no one is checking that people will just park there who dont pay for it .Leaving members that do ;pay for it to loose out on the parking spaces. It is really frustrating. Alot of people also cut in the lines to get in .I think that employees that see this should speak up and let them know they will help the guest who was first. I will say that the shows are awesome . The food is decent. I love that they have starbucks.The bathrooms are very clean. Landscaping is gorgeous. I dont think the drinks or food is over priced and it is also very cool that they serve beer as well."
2383,8/16/2009,5,"ok so i just wanted to clear up a few things for the previous, as well as future yelpers. (:aiight, so i know the skinny on a lot of the stuff ya'll are complaining about.first off all, parking. yes, its lame. but what amusement park DOESNT charge you for parking.? only the zoo. :P Â haha. so anyways, my advice:if you think youll come to seaworld more than three times, get a silver passport. you get 365 days from the purchase date, free parking, and discounts. Â it pays for itself, trust me. also, buy the silver pass on seaworlds website. itll save you $12 for that parking we no longer refund. Â :/ Â also, dont forget AAA discounts are availbe online. ! AND, when looking for parking, planters are a good place because they cant park cars on that other side, so they end up open.ok next, admission. yes. its expensive. $65 for adults, $55 for kids. cheaper than universal, and disney, but not the zoo or wild animal park. go to mcdonalds or subway for discount coupons currently available. discount: $49.95 for adults, $39.95 for kids, up to six total per coupon, SINGLE DAY ONLY. as in ONE day. not a fun card. i know they are the same PRICE, but they arent the same THING! anywho, AAA offers discounts. check the website for any other offers. also theres the adults kids price and recieve a second visit free deal as well. NO discounts apply to this offer. also, advice for those military getting their complimentary tickets: PLEASE have all the military IDs ready for the people at the booth. if your wife has no ID, save your visit for when she does. they will NOT let you in without valid dependant IDs for ages 10+ (:ok. let me seee....they dont let food in, so dont try. UNLESS you hide it all in a bag UNDER clothes, packed tight. then the security ambassadors wont both digging to the bottom and assume its all clothes. (: the skytower and skyride are $3 each because seaworld does not own them. they are technically owned by an outside company, which is why they charge for that and not the cool rides. get to any show you want to see early. during the week, maybe 10 minutes. saturdays, 15 to 20 minutes. i dont believe they serve free beer anymore, and the beer school closed because anheuser busch was bought by inbev. they chose to close those down, not seaworld. (:bring anything you dont want to have to buy, whether its sunscreen, towels, flip flops, change of clothes, or hats. Â i think that about covers it. (:so go to seaworld, and have fun. dont bword at the employees though, because chances are theyve been there for 6 hours, and have already been yelled at earlier that day! :Pthanks(:"
2384,3/20/2014,5,"For my seven-month-old baby and I, getting a two-year pass is the best decision I made. Sea World is such a perfect park for young babies, because most of the animals are constantly moving and right behind glass, my baby gets to experience seeing the animals. She loves the aquariums and can watch the fish swim around forever. She also loves the noisy and brightly colored flamingoes. The park also has several nursing/changing rooms, offers restaurants that will warm bottles, has lots of tables for feeding baby food, provides free stroller locks, has air conditioned indoor aquariums for escaping the heat, is pretty flat for effortless stroller pushing. When I've gone to the park, it's been just me and my baby, and it has always been very manageable because of the baby friendly features. Plus, with the two-year pass, it works out to just $8 a visit if I go once a month, so I don't feel like I'm wasting money if I only stay a few hours each time."
2385,8/25/2010,4,"I've gone several times, and each time with adults. Â Which may be why my experience is a lot better. Â Going with other ""big kids"" makes maneuvering through here A LOT easier and faster. Â But anyway, it's what you'd expect. Â Lots of stuff to do, expensive food, and lots of walking around. Â I recommend two things... 1) Take the time to look over show times on the back of the map you get when you walk in. Â That way, you can plan out what you want to see. Â If not, you will end up missing shows or running around like a chicken without a head. Â 2) Buy the all day eating pass thingy. Â You pay about $30 and you get to eat unlimited times at several places throughout Seaworld. Â Each passthrough you get one entree, a drink, and a side/desert. Â Definitely worth the investment if you plan on being there all day. Â The best place by far is the smokehouse so I'd say eat there last. Â If not, you'll be disappointed by the rest of the places versus eating mediocre and saving the best for last. Lots of hype about Blue Horizons. Â It sucked. Â Cirque show was the best for me. Â Ended up skipping Shamu. Â Shh.. don't tell."
2386,11/29/2009,5,"My son and I went here for the first time November 09'. Because it's an off season there was barely anyone there, which was great. We could sit anywhere during the shows, no lines for rides Â and we didn't have to make reservations to eat with Shamu. All of the staff was helpful and friendly.Weather was great in the low 70's and nice and sunny.We were able to get everything done (including 2 shows) in one day. I'd say at least once do the eat with Shamu show. It is pricey during lunch at $40 for adults, $30 for kids, (kids 2 and under eat free). It's a buffet with good food. Adults get a glass of wine or one beer included. Breakfast is almost half this price seaworld.com/sitepage.asâ€¦The whole thing went on for at least an hour if not longer, this left plenty of time for everyone to enjoy chatting and eating while watching the whales, watching the apx. 20 minute show and taking videos and pictures. There were about 5 whales swimming around us and so close you can practically touch them.We enjoyed the Killer Whale show called Believe.I loved touching the huge bat rays. Someday when we have more money we'll have to pay the $170 a person and swim with a dolphin. I'd also love to do their special tours for a little more seaworld.com/sitepage.asâ€¦.We will definitely be back again!Sea World was included in my City Pass for southern CA parks, I highly recommend it since it saved me a ton of money! You can buy one at commerce.4adventure.com/â€¦"
2387,4/6/2009,4,"Great amusement park for a 6 year old, Â my son, who loves animals. I think spring break is the perfect time to go, the weather is just right. We spent about $200 for 3 adults and one child with AAA discount ($12 off each ticket) and we stayed until the park closes at 9pm. One draw back is they don't allow visitors to bring food in, only water, and It's quite expensive eating inside the park. To save money, have a big breakfast before going in, and have a late dinner afterwards."
2388,9/15/2012,4,"Twice to SeaWorld Orlando, first time in San Diego SW. Â Went 9/14/2012, had a great, great time. Â The park was pretty much empty ( so this is a good time to go :) ) and there were no lines for any rides. Â A couple of the rides were closed for maintenance, but that was OK as we spent most of our time at the shows, which were excellent. Â Probably the highlight of the day was Dine with Shamu. Â Highly recommend this in-park excursion. Â The service was excellent, the food was exceptional and the whales (3 females) were delightfully entertaining. Â What a great way to each lunch and to take a break from running around the park. Â Overall, experiences at this park very similar to the Orlando SeaWorld's, and we have always had a great time at those parks. Â I would come back to SWSD next trip to town. Â Oh, also wanted to highlight the very nice employees that we encountered at the park. Â Everyone was very helpful and friendly."
2389,8/28/2010,5,"There is no experience like seeing a live orca for the first time. Oh, and you really have to back up like a dozen bleachers or you will get slammed by a wall of whale water!"
2390,8/10/2009,2,"So adults get in at kid's price right? Which is still something ABSURD like $60.00. But they try to make you feel better by offering you the rest of the year free. As my nephew and I roamed the park going from ""show"" to ""show"" and attempted to get on the one of two rides (attempted because we gave up after waiting an hour in line) we wondered why anyone would want to come back here within the same year..."
2391,8/9/2006,4,"I was here a number of years ago with family. The park lets you get up close and personal with their residents. Great aquariums, and of course the Shamu show. This park also features a neat Cirque show in and out of the water. Pretty neat."
2392,4/11/2009,5,"Whether you're a SD local, or visiting from out of town, Sea World has bunches to offer! Â :-) Â Given that I'm a local, I prefer to go for short bursts...not wearing myself out in one, big, long, crowded day. Â BUT, when entertaining out of towners, those full days are fun, too.Prepare yourself for the crowds....people are happy and pretty friendly, for the most part. Â Put on your patience, though. Â I got into a tense moment in the parking lot last time I went...ugh.I digress...the shows are great, the rides break things up a bit....and seeing the animals in the various tanks around the park is amazing! Â I particularly like the beluga whales and the polar bears. Â The penguins are cool, too. Â My vote is to take the moving sidewalk down once, then go up top and watch from the stationary ground...then take the moving sidewalk once more.Do check out the flamingos...which I hear they walk into the park each morning right at the opening...but I've not yet rushed there first thing to see it for myself. Â My tips for a successful day are:*bring a BIG ziploc bag for your cell phone, camera, etc. while going on the watery rides or sitting in the soak zone at the shows*if you must wear flip flops, have a better pair of walking shoes in the car, just in case!*bring in snacks...or have a picnic lunch in the car, or carry it with you....food is SUPER pricey!!*limit any souvenir shopping to the latter part of the day...unless you're going to the car at lunch, then...shop and leave your purchases in the car*WEAR SUNSCREEN...and REAPPLY!! Â Even on a cloudy day...*Plan to arrive at shows early for seating...they'll close the stadium when it gets full....even if there are another 15 minutes until start time!*See the duck pond BEHIND the bat ray exhibit*Listen at the exhibits for the educators....they share GREAT INFORMATION...and will answer any questions you have....PLUS...they even have cool stuff to touch, like shark skin at the sharks and bat ray teeth at bat rays..."
2393,1/27/2010,5,Great fun. Â  Love the shows . Go on a weekday and its not too busy. Â We bought a year and got a year free.
2394,5/26/2010,4,"My daughter loves Seaworld. Â The best part for her is to see the Shamu show. Â The show is cute and they change it up a bit during the year. Â Since we live in North County, the drive is easy. Â I would have given it more stars, but the food is just okay compared to Legoland. Â Don't get me wrong. Â There are a lot of choices, but they all don't seem very good. Â We have the two-year pass, so we go quite often. Â I think we have already tried most of the restaurants. Â Overall, it is a good place to take the family for all ages."
2395,8/1/2010,4,Wild Animal Park is better but Sea World is definitely a must about once a year. The best part...the food is awesome! Â Get their early and buy an all day dining pass. Â Totally worth it if you spend the whole day and eat all meals and snacks there.
2396,1/18/2011,5,"I love you SeaWorld!!I gathered a few friends this year and convinced them to get a fun card with me, so we can pay for one day, and go back all year for free :DThe salt water taffy in the gift shop is incredible, and I've even gone in there occasionally just to eat at Mama Stella's Italian eatery! Don't miss out on feeding and petting the dolphins either, it's only $5 bucks!I heard there was a new dolphin show this year! So stoked! All the events are great and I swear I wanna take their otter home! hehe"
2397,7/6/2010,3,I went to Seaworld July 4th and it was just OK would not pay full price for this place...thankfully we were able to get 20 bucks off our ticket's....The Shamu show was not that great i was wishing it was over 5 mins into it! The Cirque show sucked too...I really thought there was more to see at this park its not that big for what they are charging...The only thing i enjoyed was the Penguins! Dont think i would go back!
2398,8/7/2010,4,Awesome shows! There isn't much to comment on with a few hundred reviews already written. Seaworld is a must see for all people visiting and for residents. My only beef: WHY would anyone card 55+ adults for a beer?! That was pretty ridiculous and they weren't too happy either. The reason: They would get fired if they didn't ask for ID. Okay Seaworld...a little lame don't you think?
2399,3/27/2010,5,"Okay, so everyone knows about SeaWorld so I'm not going to write a review about it. Â But I do want to take the time to let you know about the unlimited food wristbands that can be purchased. Â It allows you to get one drink, one entree, one side, and one dessert at almost all the restaurants in the park. Â You can do this an unlimited number of times as long as you get back in line each time (no big deal). Â I definitely recommend this if you plan on eating, at least, lunch and dinner, in the park. Â You'll get much more plus desserts. Â I love desserts and they have some pretty good ones. Â They don't really advertise this deal but it is available so ask about it. Â Unfortunately, I don't remember how much it costs. Â I think it was $29.99 for adults and maybe half that for children."
2400,12/20/2012,3,"If you have the choice, go to florida. The Sea World there is a lot better. Definitely not for teenagers........this place is better for little kids."
2401,10/7/2010,5,"I went to Sea World San Diego today. I have not been there for about 10 years. They have improved the place in many ways. They have all the shows, and have added a few thrill rides. There is food of all kinds sold all over the park. Sea World is a Â fun filled day. You can spend a lot of money there, but I got the one year pass and saved a few bucks. The pass also lets you take your time and if you do not see everything, you can come back another day."
2402,7/7/2010,3,"Wow expensive very but it was worth it. Kids enjoyed all the shows which were great. Everything is expensive, everything. Would have given it 4 stars if it wasn't so expensive."
2403,11/15/2010,4,"I have been in amusement parks and places like Sea World all around the globe. I've seen dolphin shows before, but this was the first time I've seen a killer whale show. It was well- rehearsed and very high quality. The dolphin show was also very good with gymnastics and acrobatics, as well as the dolphins. The other places were also really good, but I was disappointed that some of the places still weren't free, like the skytower and the sky rail. For the $70 ticket, I expected for everything to be free except souvenirs. $70 is pretty expensive for an amusement park ticket, no matter how good the amusement park is. Is Sea World a great park? Yes. Is it worth $70 per ticket? No."
2404,10/4/2010,5,This southern california attraction is everything i dreamed of and more.not only do they the regular attractions such as shamu which was very good.He did splash and i was right in the splash zone but thats okay cuz i dried off pretty quickly.they have something for everyone at seaworld including rides.the rides aren't as thrilling as they are in other amusement parks but they do fit in well with the park. you really do learn alot about marine life here and just about every shark and whale are exhibited here.a great place to spend the day.
2405,6/30/2010,4,"My family really enjoyed Sea World. Â Though I've been to better aquariums, the Shamu show Believe and the Dolphin show was amazing. Â I liked the Polar bears and Penguins. Â The sharks were nice too but not as great as I'd have liked. Â  Overally, it's a nice place to go with kids. Â My son loved every second of it!"
2406,9/28/2010,5,"What can I say? I really loved Sea World. I had the pleasure to go with all my family, I had a great time. The shows with the animals are pretty fun, and there is too much to see. The cost is really worth it."
2407,10/25/2012,3,"I loved the visit here, but had to go twice because the first time it rained ALOT! They didn't even give refund and they closed many of the goodrides such as: Manta, Skyride, Riptide Rapid and alot of viewing like shamu! My dad and I that day were just mostly viewing the animals, but we were vary disapointed! The second time was alot more fun because the Manta was opened and was Â very fast exciting ride!:) But the skytower and riptide rapid as well as skytower were closed because of ""high"" wind power, but it wasn't that bad, we still understood for safety! The polar bear ride or atlantic was very stupid in the begginning, it a room that they pretend your riding in a airplane, but afterwards it was a nice view of bulugas, polar bears, fish and more! The ""airplane"" ride was very unneccesary and fake! I'm twelve, so I think younger kids will think it is more fun. Overall, this was a nice viewing, but terrible customer service and expensive ticket and parking admission! I highly recommend the Manta and the aquariums where they hold sea animals!:)"
2408,12/6/2011,2,"This place used to be a childhood favorite of mine all the way till 2007 when I last visited. However, I went back in November and was extremely disappointed by all the changes. First they didn't have human interaction shows with the killer whales and dolphins anymore because of the trainer's death controversy recently. It was like all they did was tell them to do tricks like a pet dog. And the dolphin show was doing a Cirque D'Soile type show that really took away from the animals and I hate that stuff too anyways. The sea lion show was awful as well as they seemed to focus more on the corney and lackluster jokes of the trainers. They also took away some past time favorites of mine like the Japanese gardens where you could touch sting rays and replaced them with terrible looking Atlantis rides and buildings. I guess they're Sea World so they'll always have business regardless but I was really disappointed."
2409,1/3/2009,3,"I think Sea World is kind of overrated. Maybe it's because I'm not that much of an animal lover, but to me, this place is like a ""once you've been here once, you've pretty much have done everything"" kind of amusement park, and it's really not that exciting. The shows are mediocre at best. I'm not really impressed that a dolphin can jump over a pole, and then they raise it higher and OMG it can jump higher over the pole again. It may be amazing to some people, but to me, I can watch it on Youtube and get the same feeling. The staff however does seem to care for the animals, which is sweet, I respect that they have passion for what they do, and that's great for anyone. They don't have very many rides, but they have a couple, but if you're a roller coaster fan like I am, you'll be disappointed, but don't come to Sea World for the rides, cause you'll end up hating the park all together, and that's not what I'm trying to say. The best part about the park to me were the aquariums and other animal exhibits. They even had insect ones too, which I didn't really care for because I can't stand bugs. I loved all of them expect the bug ones, and the shark one, because I'm afraid of sharks and bugs. Oh, and they also have cute merchandise stores! I love the stuffed animals, so cute! Lol. Overall, the park was an enjoyable one time experience. I don't plan on going back anytime soon though, but if you love animals and stuff like that, you will love this place, and you should defiantly come here."
2410,7/8/2009,4,"I LOOOOOOOVE Seaworld. Â What's better than looking at adorable animals show off all their tricks?! Â My favorite show is the Shamu show at night (I think it's called Shamu Rocks) and it beats all the shows! Â Make sure you don't sit in the front rows (the soak zone) unless you plan on freezing your butt off at night during the show... which some of you may like. Â But I loved all the shows, my second favorite being the Dolphin show. Â Seaworld is great for ALL ages so bring everyone to celebrate good times. =]"
2411,10/23/2009,5,"I loved this place! Â Of the Zoo, Wild Animal Park, and SeaWorld - SeaWorld definitely wins.Tickets: Â Either buy a San Diego Go Card to get a Best Value ticket, or bring your Southwest Airlines Frequent Flyer card for a 10%? discount, or get those passes for the Zoo/Park/SeaWorld. Â If you go to all 3 parks, the passes you can get at any of those places would be the best deal. Â If you do a whole bunch of other stuff, the San Diego GoCard would probably suit you better. Â If you just go to SeaWorld, bring your Southwest Airlines card - I think that gives you the best deal even compared to online tickets (but only by a few bucks). Â If you are going to go more than once in a year, become a member.SeaWorld is really organized. Â The map is easy to follow. Â Plenty of employees around to ask questions if you feel like it. Â Get there early (must pay for parking), look at the show times for all the different shows, and plan your day at SeaWorld according to the shows. Â Shows open 30 minutes before showtime so keep that in mind if you want good seats.The shows I saw and loved: Â (1) Â Shamu/Killer whale show, of course. Â There are 2 different shows - we asked a worker there what was better and he suggested that one was a little more educational and one was more for entertainment purposes. Â We went to the entertaining one - and it really was! Â The whole front section of 16 rows will get soaking wet - do not be fooled and sit in the 16th row - you may still be soaked! Â (2) Â The PetsRule show - this show is perfect for any pet lover (cats and dogs) - it's amazing how well trained and extensive this show is! Â FAVORITE! Â Loved it. Â (3) Â Sea Lion show - they're so cute and smart! Â This show has a bunch of small up-to-date skits that are fun and entertaining.Food - you can bring drinks/water into the park, but they don't let you bring in food (you can try to sneak snacks in - it didn't seem to be that hard). Â I'd recommend eating beforehand. Â I didn't try any of the food there so I can't comment on that.Love this place! Â If I lived in San Diego I would totally become a member. Â This is perfect for families and children too."
2412,10/12/2012,5,"Just went to Sea World (used to work there a looong time ago), and Pets Rule was awesome!! Â Those animals are amazing, and I LOVED the message that they were all rescued from shelters, but still are talented and trainable. Â Those animals are definitely earning their keep at Sea World, and my husband and I liked the Pets Rule show better than any of the marine mammal shows. Â Really well orchestrated and staged, and even adorable when the pets would lose focus and have to be brought back by the humans. Â Well done Sea World!"
2413,6/18/2012,5,"the park always have something new. love it, lots of great memories :)"
2414,9/7/2009,5,"sea world is so much fun! aside from feeling bad about paying animals to do tricks for me all day, i really enjoyed myself. sea world has added a lot of new stuff (and mostly from the help of sponsors, whose names are prominently everywhere) and i would say the only thing NOT worth going on is the shipwreck rapids. you get soaked with dirty park water and have to wait for 50 minutes. if there is no line and its sweltering hot, then maybe id go back on it. but the ride itself is pretty anti-climactic. the wild arctic ride is just like star tours at disneyland but still fun. the penguins, polar bears and dolphins were my favorite! i want to go back and do the behind-the-scenes stuff. but if its your first time, do the basic, then go back a few years later for things like dolphin feeding. the dolphin discovery show was entertaining but a bit short. it was better than shamus believe, which was less interactive. check out the arcade for a break from the sun and play some skiball. the ""budweiser"" clydesdale exhibit is a bit random and pointless. and smells. you dont really go to a sea park to see a horse. theres a firework show at night (shamus sky splash), maybe only in the summer and the skytower (a panoramic view of the city) and the bayside skyride are lovely at night. oh and the parking lot is huge ($12 to get in), so take a picture of where your car is!"
2415,6/12/2010,2,"Sea World and new Show: Blue HorizonsGayle Cooley says:June 12, 2010 at 7:00 amI saw this show yesterday, and overall was under impressed. The stage is beautiful, and the water effects quite magical, but the attempt to combine the fantasy and flair of a Cirque style show with an eco centered dolphin show just doesn't work in my opinion.I adore Cirque shows and have seen several. I also absolutely love Dolphins. So why didn't this work for me? If I want to see Cirque, I will go see a Cirque show that I can get lost in the pure visual magic of. I go to Sea World to enjoy, learn about, and interact with the animals and people who work with them. In short, I want more Dolphins in my Dolphin show.As a sidebar, Sea World in general seems to have taken a dive further into the ""make a buck"" zone. The main reason I have been an annual pass member at Sea World for years, has been the wonderful chance they offered to engage with, pet and feed Dolphins. The park now has most of the Dolphin pool corded off for the bulk of the day, leaving one small area open, and it is an area where the Dolphins cannot come up close to the wall to visit with people. If you want to visit hands on with the Dolphins, you must now either buy food to feed them during two short opportunities daily; OR you must pay a $40 fee to participate in what Sea World calls a ""Dolphin Interaction."" Basically a 15 minute lecture with a short chance to touch one of the animals.That beautiful Rocky Point pool was designed to give park guests the opportunity to interact with these animals, hands on, and now the park has replaced that with a ""pay more to play"" policy, that defeats all the original intent of the park, and this exhibit in particular. It's a crying shame.Sea World, please reinstate your original mission to educate and engage visitors with the wonderful world of the sea, and it's amazing inhabitants."
2416,7/27/2010,3,"We went this weekend to see the new dophin show and must say we were underwhelmed by it. Â The backdrop is fantastic, but the show is too heavy ""people"", and too lite on the Â ""dolphins"". Â The designers of this show put a Cirque de la Mar into the show, vs. highlighting the animals and this was a miss. Â Seaworld, give us more dolphins - that's why we come to the park. Â The Shamu shows were great, as it is always amazing to see what the killer whales can do."
2417,10/2/2010,4,"Nice show, great to see shamu, Not so many attractions, but if you like fish (and big ones) it is a definitely must see area."
2418,1/4/2011,1,"DO NOT go to Sea World on days with low attendence. Â They cancel most of the shows even though it is not raining, lots of people are there and their web page says there will be a show. Â Surprise, no show, no appology, no refund. Â Tough lucku sucker."
2419,6/12/2010,4,Silver member...go very frequently...good San Diego must go place. New blue horizon show was very nice (though much distracting)..Just wish there is some guideline about fully pregnant trainer not doing dangerous act (in Shamu show)...
2420,9/1/2012,1,"Food at sea world, was the WORST i've ever tasted. Sea world should be shut down. People that go there after I have posted, shame on you ! What I should have done was when I took the first bite, I should have taken the plate of garage, they call food and thrown it right back at the employee that served it. I should have taken my money and gone to Phil's BarbBaQue.Don't eat there. The park itself is overrated not worth the price and they should be shut down.If there were more people like me, Sea World would be out of bisness. If you don't believe me, the cost for 1 day for 2 people is over $200.00 ."
2421,7/24/2008,4,"It's been over 10 years since I've been to Seaworld and it truly looks like it's been transformed to a new park to me. Â I'm a sucker for the shows. Â The ultimate crowd pleaser is Shamu show. Â We caught the evening performance, so the lights and the screens really give the show a cool effect. Â The exhibits are always neat to see too. Â My fav by far is the shark encounter. Â The food prices aren't too bad, I especially liked the stuffed jalapeno pretzel. Â If you have a AAA card, you only pay $46 for the single day tix instead of $61."
2422,7/21/2010,5,Sea World is a fun park. Lots of animals! Get there early to catch the Shamu show-the storyline they are using is crappy but the animals are AMAZING! The new dolphin Show Blue Horizon's again dumb storyline but watching the animals is so much fun! Our favorite show was the Sea Lion & otter show! So hilariously funny!! It's well worth the crowds to see it!
2423,7/19/2014,2,"went on a friday; as recommended not to go Â on the weekend....i dont know what the crowds are like on the weekends, but the friday we went it was packed!..bought ticket online which was $50.00 (m-f only)...parking $15.00 if bought also online (you save a $1.00)....they have a handfull of shows and a handfull of rides...didnt watch any shows because no shade to sit in (all seats in the sun)...lines for the rides are very long also...seen mostly all of exhibits except shark reef..the line was extremely long for this one; dont know why....food overpriced; but where isnt!....kinda funny that they serve seafood at Seaworld...you go to see fish and what not and they serve fish to eat...hummmm....all in all; if we didnt have 4 free tickets, i would NEVER pay the price to get into here....probably would never go back unless i had free tickets again:)"
2424,7/9/2012,2,"Sea World should be about the animals. Â Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this place are sorrowfully different from reality. Â It seems that the shows have become very much about people, and the animals are only there to do a few flips and splash people. Â It saddens me actually to see these animals doing dog tricks. Â Not sure if I would want my children seeing the sea world circus. Â Ironic that one of the shows 'cirque de la mer' could actually sum up the experience. Â Instead of pirating themes from other great theme parks and productions, sea world should focus on bringing back the 'aquarium' experience. Â I think people and kids would much rather see killer whales behaving naturally, instead of like domestic pets."
2425,7/16/2009,5,Absolutely love this place. The shipwreck rapids are my favorite!! Sitting in the front of the dolphin & shamu show is a must!!!
2426,7/5/2012,4,"The staff, most but not all, are very friendly. They seem to focus on customer satisfaction. Only beef i have is that all the show ends at about 6:30 pm or before. Which doesn't make sense because the park closed at 11 pm. There are a few rides still opened but not much else to do. Almost kinda scary to walk in some part of the park cause it looks totally deserted - go from like 5000 people to about 500 people in matter of minutes. If you plan it just right then you should be able to see most of the shows, which many are very funny and cool. I had a good experience considering i had to take care of 7 kids."
2427,8/10/2010,5,"I /love/ Seaworld and its killer whales. Yes I'm a killer whale addict I know everything about each of them. :P That's the main reason I go. Anyways, Sumar and Ulises are amazing. New dolphin show is pretty cool too. But what's not to like? x3 There's also a dog kennel too. That's nice. :P"
2428,9/5/2012,2,"Native Californian, first time Sea Worlder.....and probably last timer. Of course coming off the heels of Disneyland the day before, nothing could compare however, we were really disappointed. Ironically, I briefly admired the front entrance that brought me back to my childhood days. Those days with nothing fancy parking lots where you walk right up to the ticket booth (like Disneyland used to have). What I admired in front was not so impressive inside. The outdated feel of SW was not so nostalgic and the park is actually small. The few shows we watched including Shamu, not so impressive and Im convinced they dont offer shade at these shows so they can pick your pockets for hats, sunscreen, water and all the other extras you'll pay for because of the sweltering sun. Yeah, they are walking around like circus employees in the crowd, feeding off of your near heatstroked brain. My kids were more interested in the rides which I know are not the point of SW. Childrens area is small with nothing more than a few carnival like rides. Older kids liked the Manta, but were more taken with the Atlantis water ride. Shipwreck lines too long because of hot weather and we didnt partake in any park food so I can't comment on that. All in all, a minimally enjoyed experiance in that we can now say we went to Sea World but definitely wouldnt spend the $ to go back ever. Price is too high. Spend a few more dollars for Disneyland. The vibe at SW doesnt compare to Disney. You get what you pay for at Disney, unfortunately, I felt robbed at S.W."
2429,1/10/2008,4,"this place is awesome. i bought a one year pass ticket for the admission of a one day pass... went at least 4 times last year. it's great if you have friends/relatives in town and you want to show them around. my favorite shows - shamu (obviously) dolphin show, penguin exhibit, and the dolphin feeding area. bring your cameras/camcorders and take 2GB of pix!one cool thing to do is after the shamu show go down to the ""killer whale"" underwater viewing area. have someone take your pic as he swims by the big glass window. (i'll post my pic of it soon) or, order some fish to feed the dolphins and take pix of you petting them. woo hoo!"
2430,3/2/2010,2,What else can I say except it was a great time with the family. Â I'm just glad I didn't get eaten by a Killer Whale. Â Food is a rip and not that good. Â Make sure to take your young kids on the Atlantis ride...it's a lot of fun.
2431,9/6/2010,3,Good place to take the kids when the beach is not an option. Â I feel sorry for the whales. Â The gondola ride over the park still makes me nervous.
2432,7/21/2009,4,"I hadn't been here since I was just a little kid, and based on those memories, my expectations weren't high.I was pleasantly surprised. The shows were better than I remember with their music, messages and video screens. Yes, the humor was a little weak sometimes, the planted show participants disappointing, and the ""believe"" message of the Shamu show extremely cheesy, but the effort was there. The conservation message was not too overwhelming and depressing.We saw just about every show and every exhibit in 2 days time, minus the rides because the wait was 75 and 90 minutes. Â That's too much of a wasted chunk of my life. Â It seemed like the Journey to Atlantis ride was always broken/closed.The lines for food and snacks were outrageous, but it tasted better than I expected it to, and the variety was impressive. It's much more than a frisbee of a hamburger, popcorn and fries. I enjoyed feeding the sealions and being able to be so close to the animals. I was SO bummed that they were out of dippin' dots all over the park!"
2433,7/4/2012,5,"First I would like to say that my 5 star rating come from over 5 years of bringing my children here. The attractions are great, the food is good, the shows are wonderful and most of all the care for the animals is fantastic. I dont understand why people would rate if they have no idea what they are talking about. If you were to see that actual behind the scenes area that the animals have access to you would not think they are being held capitve. Most of these animals were saved on the verge of being killed or in danger. Another thing is the reason for no lids and paper straws is not because they are cheap but its because of the safety to the wild life (birds, seagulls, squirrles, etc...). So this is mainly for Jen S you should get your facts straight before putting horrible reviews and making a place like Sea World looks bad when they are actually saving animals."
2434,2/28/2008,4,"I really like sea world. It might be because i just go here for a few hours. I go to a few aquariums, feeds the seals and sea lions, and ride the rides. I love the polar bears and otters. I think i like this place so much because i can go here for a few hours and be happy and then go to Phil's bbq. I thought it was expensive which it is. But now you can spread the payments over a whole year. I figure if i go around five times its way worth it. I only go during the week thought, this place would not be worth it during the busy summer or weekends."
2435,7/17/2008,5,"I really thought I would hate this place, but it was just a magical day all around. The first thing I saw was the tank of sea otters, and I stood there watching them floating on their backs, and one of them was whacking a clam on a rock resting on his belly. I was completely enthralled. As I stared at him, I thought, ""I'm taking one of those home today. How can I transport a sea otter in a Honda Civic? Should I buckle him in a seat or put him in a styrofoam ice chest? I'm sure he'll be fine in my bathtub."" The day just got better and better: the penguins! The whales! So much fun. I thank my family that dragged me here. I never would have gone otherwise."
2436,8/10/2009,4,"As everyone else has pointed out, the prices are absurd, that's pretty much a given, but you are supporting a good cause, and there really is nothing else like it anywhere in town. Â I get tired of people putting down SeaWorld. Â It's a tourist attraction that also funds wildlife research and preservation, plus, they have dolphin shows - dolphins people, dolphins."
2437,8/21/2009,4,"i have been here in different stages of my life, in my teens, as a tourist, as a guest,and now for family vacation. Can't think of any places to go easy after the long summer session work,but children for me would just be entertained in the most simplest way. Â Can't believe how much it has increased in price for a day pass..what is utmost importatnt is Â how positive the interaction/ relationship is...the best part of the park is the grand finale of spectacular movement and dance called rythmic gymnastic dance and modern dance explosions, which has awaken me up ...very entertaining!"
2438,6/19/2012,2,Its gone down hill since the 90s. Shamu show is shorter than it used to be and garbage. They even have a show that involves 0 marine life.
2439,6/10/2012,5,seaworld is a great place to hang out with friends and to learn about sea life!! very informative and fun!!
2440,7/13/2012,3,"Way overpriced and the shows kinda sux. The rides were fun, but the same types of rides can be found at universal or disneyland that ar better. Food is expensive like most parks.overall it was just ok. It is good to tryif u have never been there, but ihave no desire to go back for awhile."
2441,9/11/2008,5,"SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMU SHAMUDid I say SHAMU?Those were the cult like chants that the Shamu show had the entire audience chant. Â Wow, I love Sea World. Â The whales were better trained than my cat! Â What went wrong there?Anyhow, if you some how end up in San Diego, please do all of us a favor and go to Sea World. Â It is a place where the supernaturals really seem to exist!"
2442,8/9/2009,4,"Didn't think much as I bought the tickets, but right after the first Shamu show in the morning, I totally felt that the tickets were quite worth the price. Â Me and my bf enjoyed all the shows we went to; they really put up some quality shows compare to other theme parks I've been to. Â Be sure to put on lots of sun block and line up at least 30 mins before the Sea Lion Life show since the stadium is much smaller compare to the other ones and can fill up really fast. Â Also, when they mark the soak zone, they do mean that you will have a good chance to get soaked up, so bring towels and rain coat if you want to chance it. (We were sitting in the soak zone for most of the shows but luckily didn't get wet at all.)After you watch all the day time shows, there's about a 2-hour gap before the night time show starts, so you can get a stamp on your hand and keep your parking receipt to go out for cheaper dinners and come back, which was what we did. Â I'm a new fan of Shamu now~can't help to buy the wooden necklace even though I know it's just part of their sales ideas. Â I wish I can train my cat to be like so."
2443,9/7/2009,4,"Shamu did the darn thang. Â The park was rather small, but nice none the less. Â I would definitely go again."
2444,10/15/2009,4,Spent the day with my husband and grandson at Sea World today. Â It was not so crowded. It was organized and we had a great time. Â The only thing we didn't like was the food at Mama Stella's. Â The food was kind of cold and we ended up throwing half of it away. The only good thing was the lunch box that came along with the meal.
2445,3/6/2010,5,"Its Seaworld whats there really to complain about, military supportative, cold beer decent food and lots for kids to do!!! I go here over the zoo any day. I hit them up about once a week. I got a pass so no fees. Kids wear themselves out in the bay of play, touch sea life, watch shows etc. Never a dull moment. Looking foward to new Blue Horizons show coming out in May. Â Cant really say price because it depends on what you want to do I can spend nothing and have a great time or dine, sky rides etc. I'd say a typical family of four to eat is about $40. The pass is worth it saves parking fees and there are special events and such only for pass members. If your gonna be around for a bit splurge for the Platnium Pass, gets way better parking & priority or special seating at attractions plus other in park discounts like 10% off foods and I think 15% on collectable stuff."
2446,6/6/2014,3,"Seaworld has some amazing deals. I got the year membership which includes free parking, year admission from the time you bought the card and discounts on EVERYTHING at seaworld... They also have cups you buy for 10$ and you get refills for 1$ each (they also have the updated drink machine where you can make it cherry coke, vanilla coke, lime sprite etc.) they also have this deal where you buy a thing of popcorn and you get refills for 1$.... Â We ate at shipwreck cafe and their salads are AMAZING.... The seamore and Clyde show is so cool I love the songs and everything about it. But a couple weeks ago I applied to work here and I had an interview.... I applied for merchandise photographer and I have a background of photography and I was easily qualified for the job... At the group interview I talked to a lot of people there and no one... NO ONE was a playing for merchandise photographer... A week later no call... A month later no call.. To this day no call... ARE YOU SERIOUS? AT LEAST CALL,EMAIL OR SEND ME A LETTER SAYING I DIDNT GET THE JOB... To me that's rude.. You're always supposed to notify a person wether they got the job or not."
2447,5/5/2009,4,"Sea World is our new favorite hangout place. Currently Sea World is running a special called a fun pass. You buy a one day pass and you automatically have an annual pass for the rest of the year. Â This is a pass that is good from the day you buy it until Dec, 31. We got me a Silver pass. this is an annual pass, it is good for 365 days from when you buy it. If you buy this online you can get 2 extra months free. Pay to have a parking pass added to your pass, the one day parking is $12, if you visit the park three times, you have paid for the parking pass. We have an 18 month old and she is free until she is 3.We have friends that also have this set of passes, and we meet each other there for play dates once or twice a month.The children's play area is awesome, it has something for little crawlers and toddlers all the way up to pre teens. they have stage shows, photo opps and meet the characters from Sesame Street. The little water play area is going to be our favorite place all summer I think. A few tips.. They don't allow you to bring food into the park. We have gotten in snacks for the babies, but nothing even remotely meal like. They allow you to bring in waters, but no sodas, no cups, and no outside straws. The children's meal deals are actually a pretty good deal, and quite a bit of food.The one indoors sit down restaurant, has awesome food. Â The barbecue was pretty good as well. If you have little ones, pack a back pack. If you want to see shows, you have to park your stroller, and go into the stadium. I don't like leaving all my stuff in the stroller, so I keep it all in a big back pack. REMEMBER to bring your sunscreen, you are out and walking around in the sun and near water all day long. The fireworks can be seen from almost anywhere in the park. Take your camera, and just explore. If you live locally, and get the fun pass, you can always come another day. It is really hard to see all of it in one day.There are lots of fun experiences that you can have at Sea World. Lunch with Shamu, is our next plan. There is beer, available almost everywhere in the park, just remember, you are in Â a family friendly place, and you will be in the sun most of the day, so drink responsibly."
2448,2/4/2014,3,"3 Stars is being generous. The parking (which is $15) is rather weird how they have it set up and the signage for the entrance is non-existent. If you have never been here before you kinda have to ask the other adventurist as to where you go in. We went on a Tuesday so that was great for us. There was hardly anyone there. There were no lines, no crowds and such... but the downfall is a lot of things were not open either. I would have been very disappointed had we payed regular price of $84 per person for the fact that a lot was shut down. It seemed like we seen more employees than anything. That being said we paid $149 to go to Sea World, SD ZOO & the SD Safari for unlimited entrance for 7 consecutive days. We watched 3 shows (all they had going on that day) the Dolphin show had more acrobats than actual dolphins performing so that was a bummer. The Sea Lion show was the best, the sea lions actually were the show and they had a cute little otter in it as well. The Shamu show was good, the whales were the main attraction as well. All the shows had a pre-show funny gig going on and they helped with the time going by faster. Cant say anything about the food, we were able to bring in snacks no problem. Security is not looking for your crackers. The rides are more for young elementary kids. Don't expect the tweens or teens to get too excited about them. The penguins were cool to watch. The Dolphin encounter was fun as well. They had a lot of aquariums through out the entire park. You can definitely see everything in just one day easily. The only sad thing for me was that they seemed to have a lot of animals in small quarters. Seemed like they needed more room for the amount that they had. I understand that they get injured or in danger animals and rescue them but seems like they need more room for the amount they keep. Overall I give 3 stars, to me at Six Flags you can get more bang for your buck even in the off season. :-/"
2449,6/1/2012,5,"I've coming to Sea World for several years. Their park is clean and the staff is always helpful and polite. The Shamu show now offers two versions, Shame Rocks and One Ocean. With the recent opening of the new thrill rollercoaster, Manta, my kids are wanting to come here everyday. It's a great place to spend time with the family with new things to see every visit."
2450,4/26/2012,4,I haven't been to a SeaWorld in about 17 years. Â It was nice to go back. Â This was my first time to the San Diego SeaWorld. Â There were a few rain forest animals at SeaWorld and a miniature horse. Â Didn't really like the fact that you had to ride the Wild Arctic ride to see the polar bears and beluga whale. Â One of the best parts has to be the dolphin training pool. Â There we were able to feed a dolphin. Â I saw 3 of the shows and they were all pretty good. Â The best one is the Shamu Show.
2451,5/24/2012,3,"Came here for a weekend getaway, loved our time at sea world but hated the food here! Way overpriced and the worst food I've ever had. We had pizza at the pizza restaurant - I paid $19 for a bottle of water, slice of pizza and a miniature salad! School pizza was a million times better- ill eat before or after I come here again"
2452,7/23/2008,4,2 words! soak zone :) plus an arcade and cirque de mer. :) sp?good times. :) as a san diegan i love sea world :)
2453,5/21/2009,4,"A very good day out.This theme park is for all ages. There are shows throughout the day, with lots to look at in between.The highlight of the park must be the Killer Whale show, which is very good, and so very popular, so try get there early for good seats. Try not to sit in the wet Zone, some places get very wet.All the other shows are good, and worth watching whilst there."
2454,1/13/2010,5,"So much to see, so many places to go! Â It is a must to have an organized plan with the provided map to make it to show times in the same area, then move on to your next area for more show times. Â Otherwise you are all over the place, back-tracking, losing a lot of show times. Â Have your camera and video!"
2455,2/7/2012,4,"Really great! The journey to atlantis is SO AWSOME!! And the animals ........... So cute! The ticket is REALLY expensive,though."
2456,6/20/2011,2,"I haven't been to Sea Word in over 20 years but went this past weekend. What a disappointment! It was almost $70 a ticket for adults and $61 for kids. I spent about $200 to get through the door. The shows were very nice and the animals were spectacular, but to spend that much to go through the door is absurd. Everything there is so overpriced. I felt like I was being taken advantage of. Yes, I know people plan to spend money while they are there, but that was outrageous. Newsflash, we are in a recession! I prefer the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach so much better and 1/3 of the cost. For those of you who have small kids, the Aquarium of the Pacific prices are $24.95 adults, $12.95 kids. Plus you get to pet the animals and do fun things/activities. Sea World is more like an amusement park with a few rides, long lines and tons of gift shops at outrageous prices. If you happen to like Sea World then that's great, but for me... I think that was my last visit."
2457,5/12/2012,5,"This place is awesome for those that love sealife, wildlife, animals, and the environment. The place is family-friendly. I got to eat with Shamu and see Shamu perform. You can get splashed at some of the performances, which helps people to cool down on warm or hot days. The food is good, and there are some roller coasters. I would love to go back here."
2458,3/11/2009,5,"I have a love of the ocean. when i came here at 5 years old i was dying to be one of those people who do the shows with the whales. The whales used to splash you pretty hard back then and the water went more than half way up the bleachers. Now all u get is a little splash of his tale. Well, at least they're trying to conserve water. The humungo tv screens are hypnotyzingly awsome. Enjoi."
2459,2/21/2012,5,What they are learning and teaching about conservation is very valuable- I believe that the animals are well cared for and loved- This was my favorite day in San Diego-
2460,7/19/2011,2,"kinda boring, the only times I been here it was free. can't imagine paying to get in, maybe if I had kids that really wanted to go I'd take them once, or maybe better yet, pay someone else to take them."
2461,11/5/2010,4,"We wanted to introduce our two and a half year-old son to SeaWorld and Shamu. Â The visit was his first time being up close with the larger marine mammals. Â At home, we've already taken him to all of the local spots (California Academy of Sciences, Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium), and we wanted to venture further out.We went to SeaWorld for two days.Our first day there (Wednesday), the weather started off overcast, but the sun broke through later in the day. Â Hardly anyone was at the park that day and we were able to breeze through many of the shows and exhibits on the ""left"" side of the map. Â On that day, we saw the Blue Horizons show and the Shamu Show: Â Believe. Â We thought our son would be more excited seeing the dolphins, orcas, and pilot whales, but he just didn't seem all that into it. Â He seemed to enjoy seeing the orcas and pilot whales, but got really antsy when the acrobats and trapeze artists were performing (Blue Horizons). Â He did enjoy going into the different aquarium exhibits. Â I particularly like the bat rays touching pool, but my son got scared by them and didn't want to pet them. Â By the afternoon, we decided to call it an early day and headed back to the hotel.We went back to SeaWorld on Friday, and explored the ""right"" side of the map. Â This time around, our son seemed to be more excited. Â We started off in the Wild Arctic exhibit. Â This exhibit was really, really cool as we saw beluga whales, frolicking walruses and polar bears. Â The split-level walk-through was really well-planned out and gave us great views of the animals. Â Afterwards, we headed over to the Penguin Encounter which brought us up close to the different penguins. Â We also saw the Pets Rule show. Â I have to say that the show was very neat and energetic. Â The vibe rubbed off on our son and this was the one show that he was truly happy to watch - we could tell from his body language that he was ""buzzing"" with excitement. Â After the show, some of the animals are left on-stage with their trainers, and the audience can take pictures or pet them (the pets, not the trainers)! Â We stayed and our son even wanted to pet the dog.For lunch we ate at the Seaport Marketplace - apparently, SeaWorld decided to try a pizza/pasta buffet there for a flat rate. Â This worked out for us as the price was very reasonable as compared to the general price for food in the rest of their restaurants.After lunch, we let our son play in the Sesame Street Bay of Play. Â This was the highlight for him even though he was too small for some of the activities. Â However, the area has a few rides suitable for him and an expansive play area which gave him the opportunity to just run, explore and work off any excess energy before his afternoon nap time. Â We ended our day at the Bay of Play!"
2462,12/10/2011,2,"Shamu and the dolphins are great. The can try harder but they won't be able to compensate services provided by the other employes. I have a theory... If you fail a job interview at Disney, which is not really hard, you're can catch up by applying at Seaworld. Say Hi to Chris and Erika, very smart people who never replied to any questions about the schedule and stupid enough to say ""he did not ask the right question"", when I was just about to leave. This is just an example. Services in the restaurans? It's like going to jail. Oh. And the food is more expensive than Disney's and not good at all."
2463,7/3/2009,4,"Man, I love this place. Shamu really rocks in here."
2464,7/16/2011,3,"My husband, 4 kids and i went here for the fourth of July weekend. Let me tell you we had the Dine in with Shamu, I had the dolphin encounter which was a b-day gift from my husband. So between the tickets, the dine with Shamu and the dolphin encounter you can imagine how much money we spent. Now heres why i minused the 2 points. So i take my girls to see Elmo and their is this african american girl named Diane (Im only sayin cause she was the only one their in case anyone who works their checks these reviews they know who she is) she puts the rope up so my kids cant see Elmo and tells us to come back. Then she lets this little boy go up to them and looks over at me with a crap eating grin.I asked her for a supervisor and she says she is one nodding her head as if San Diego was in the ghetto. I did tell her i would call up front and let them know how rude she was about not letting us in. . So i let my girls go on a ride and i wait in line for when they come back. The girl comes up to me to start more problems and says you have to move your stroller which ironically was rented from them. So I move it and tell her i will move it but she needs to get the f out of my face. I was already irritated with the laughing and pointing and provoking me immature way she handled her job so I was fed up. She calls security over and i tell them and they said oh next time ask for a supervisor. Well thats the point I had and she claimed she was one. I cant believe how we were treated, we usually dont spend that much money but my husband wanted me to have a great time for my birthday so I thought an ounce of respect goes along way. Especially if someone is spending that kind of money not to say that I deserve any more respect than the next guy. I have a feeling she has treated people this way before and has gotten away with it. The thing was we were their before she put the rope up her hand wasn't even near it she just put it up out of spite and left my four girls standing their and then she let a boy go see them unfair."
2465,10/1/2011,4,"This was my first time at Sea World and I gotta say, I absolutely loved it! The parking fee was fourteen dollars (for a car) and the entrance fee was about $75. Your better off buying them online before hand because they have discounts through the internet. I ended up paying $50 because of a discount. My favorite ride was Atlantis. The line wasn't too long and I got super wet. But then dried off when walking around the park. My favorite part of the park was the dolphin side. ahh their so cute! Sea World also offers dolphin interactions/encounters if you would like to get more up close. Their dolphin show was also pretty good and way better than the whale show. Everything else was pretty cool as well so my overall experience was great. I didn't eat at the park because the food is pricey but I didn't notice that they have funnel cake. I wish I would of tried it. Their bottle sodas/water aren't too expensive either (about three dollars). If your in San Diego, you must visit this place before you leave. You can also feed sea lions for about six dollars. I paid and then realized it wasn't worth it because they can eat for days. lol. It also sucks that they charge five dollars at the drying station."
2466,12/7/2013,5,it is like a boring aquarium and amusment park altogether!somthing for the little and big ones for playing all day!!!!!!
2467,12/8/2011,4,We got there right at opening and thoroughly enjoyed the entire day. Â I was surprised at the high entertainment level of the shows. Â The 'dolphin' show feature a lot of high wire acts and high diving. Â My kids loved everything about this place.
2468,4/6/2011,4,"sigh - another childhood past time. you get kind of spoiled living and growing up in southern california...i do like it here, a great place for family outings....food sucks though but whatever."
2469,8/29/2011,2,"This place confused me. I was expecting to learn about the animals, with a little flare thrown in for fun. This place is all flare, no substance, from the minute you walk through the gate where the music blares so loud you can't talk to your family, to the point where you realize you are NOT going to learn anything about dolphins, but instead are going to watch some mediocre dancers dressed like birds. The interpretation is poor to non existent, and it feels like you have to search for the exhibits through miles of commerce. It's all about getting you to spend money, very little is about conservation. (Except the hat they'll sell you)."
2470,7/13/2011,4,first time at seaworld super fun. went with my girlfriend and one of my friends. word of advice if youre thinking about going on any of the rides bring a change of clothes because you get soaked. Â the shows are very entertaining especially the sea lion and otter one. for those 21 and over the nice thing about sea world over other theme parks is that they actually serve alcohol here so that is a nice bonus that we got to enjoy during our time at the park.
2471,5/29/2011,3,"I don't like these big amusement parks. They inspect your bags and won't let you take in any snacks so they can rip you off on food and drinks. They fingerprint you at the entrance. They make you pay $12 for parking on top of the expensive entrance fee. Â But if you have kids or nephews and nieces, you put up with it. Â Some good things are that on the weekdays its not too crowded and you don't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes to get on a ride. Seeing shamu and the dolphins were cool. Its best to sit close even though you have a chance to get wet as if you sit too far, its like watching it on TV which you've seen many times. The reason you pay for it is to get up close."
2472,6/30/2006,3,"its expensive, its like an overpriced zoo, and its in san diego, come on, how great can it be?"
2473,7/9/2011,4,this park is definitely a visit once and youre good park. theres not that many attractions and the animal exhibits can be lived through vicariously at one of the san diego zoos. journey to atlantis and that river rapids ride are the only rides here. i wish they were more like the seaworld in orlando that has two awesome real rollercoasters.
2474,3/29/2007,5,"Sea world costs $56 to visit. Â If it weren't for the manatess, shamu, and AAA double value discounts I would have taken Dolly the dolphin home with me. Â I'd rather have the pilot whale but I forgot his name. Â Since we showed up to Sea world at 2pm and it closed at 7pm we didn't see all the attractions. Â Never let your little sister plan a day outting. Â The best part of Sea World was Diana Rescue. Â Those manatees are so fat and lazy it was awesome. Â I wish I could float in water and eat all day. Â I think its funny they are so lazy they won't even swim away from boats that run them over. Â Freakin fatty asses. Â I love it. Â So I bought a stuffed manatee for my own gf manatee and now she can't sleep without it. Â She cries when I want to cuddle with it. Â WTF! Â I bought it therefore I should be able to sleep with it too. Â When she starts crying I grab the stuffed manatee by the tail and use it as a weapon. Â But the other manatee ends up grabbing it and taking it for the night. Â Then I sleep alone. Â BOO!"

2476,3/9/2010,3,"I went to sea world on a Sunday afternoon. They are open till 8pm, and most people go in the mornings, so by the time we went there at fourish, it was dead. Dead is good..its like having the whole park to yourself. This was my second time going, the first was 7 years ago. I think its good to go if you've never been (or its been seven years and that's almost like never) but I woudlnt keep coming back here. We had a 3 park pass so I'm not absolutely sure of the price but I believe it's in the $80 range, and that is very, very pricey for what you get. Two rides, a shamu show, some animals you can pay to feed... it's not very big. A 4-d show is cool, last time it was goosebumps, this time it was sesame street. I went anyway because I wanted a 4 d experience, but I was absolutely the oldest person in there without a child lol. I think this park has become more children-ized and is better if you have a child or are a child. As a childless adult, its not so worth it. So, just an ok. well between a meh and an ok but ill bump it up to ok. PS they fingerprint you as you go in..that was pretty weird."
2477,3/14/2011,2,"I went Sea World recently - probably my first time in over 20 years. Â Quite honestly I was underwhelmed. Â I was with my two little kids, wife, and my sister and brother-in-law (who are annual pass holders). Â First off, it was REALLY expensive - like $65/person, even with a AAA discount. Â Like most things nowadays, the shows have been really dumbed down. Â Instead teaching you a few things about the amazing sea creatures then having them do a few tricks, the shows are all lame. Â The sea lion show has an ""SNL"" theme and is short on sea lion time. Â But it wasn't as bad as the dolphin show, which now has a lame Cirque du Soleil-esque theme about it. Â There were far more people in lame costumes swinging from bungee cords than dolphins in the show. Â The penguin exhibit is as good as it was 20 years ago - that's because it hasn't changed AT ALL. Â I remember it when it opened - exactly the same (with, the possible exception of an over-priced gift shop on the way out). Â I'm not complaining, but maybe they could spruce it up a bit? Â Overall, my kids had fun because they didn't know any better. Â Compared to the SD Zoo, Sea World blows more than Shamu's blowhole."
2478,8/2/2011,5,i thought seaworld was a fantastic amusement park the shows are great the staff was friendly the atmosphere was great Â this park was super clean Â the food was your typical amusement park food not priced too bad compared to some other places oh did i mention the kick ass san diego weather to top it off Â will definitely return again
2479,2/18/2011,5,I love Sea World. Â The shows are great... I love dolphins... Where else can you touch the sea animals and see them upclose. Â It's the perfect place for a date... lots of time to talk and take long strolls from one event place to the other. Â I really love it. Â A definite date hot spot in my book!
