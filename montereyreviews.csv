1,2020-02-25,5,"I first came here for a field trip way back in kindergarten, and I remember being enchanted by all the sea life surrounding me, to stare up at the tanks and watch all the fish and sharks swim past me with all the beautiful blue light, and leave the aquarium with an octopus plushie. My boyfriend brought me here for a birthday outing, so this was my first time back as an adult. Just as I felt when I was a kid, we were both enchanted by the marine life. If we lived close to Monterey, we would definitely get a membership here! It's so relaxing and uplifting to walk through the aquarium and enjoy the tranquility of the sea life. It was fascinating to see the sea otters, the reefs, and the jellyfishes and octopus. Such a relaxing and wonderful way to spend the afternoon."
2,2020-02-20,4,"I visited Monterey Bay Aquarium for the first time the Sunday of President's Day weekend. We got there around 10:45am after parking in the Cannery Row garage ($15 for the whole day, no hourly). I'm really glad I purchased my tickets in advance because the line to buy tickets at the door was super long! However the advance ticket line was short and moved very quickly. They do check your bags at the door so be prepared for that.The aquarium was PACKED that day. I guess I should have expected that there'd be a ton of young childen but it still surprised me. I hadn't been to an aquarium in probably a decade so I was ready to enjoy my day strolling around and admiring the  animals. However it was definitely difficult to get a good view at certain times because the exhibits were really full, and the feedings were always very full and hard to see. I wish there were more screens so everyone in the back could see. Sometimes the exhibits got super stuffy/smelly as well with all the people :(My favorites were the giant octopi, puffins, and jellies. Seeing green eels was really cool too. I loved feeling like an excited kid again. The volunteers are also really knowledgeable and friendly and willing to answer questions. The touch tanks were cool but they mostly just had seaweed/kelp, and the stingrays were all hiding from the people, though I don't blame them. Unfortunately the Tentacles exhibit was closed. I wish I could've seen more octopi or cuttlefish.Around 1pm we stepped out to grab lunch, since they have an in and out policy. Just stamp your hand before you leave and you can enter again later.At $50 a ticket for adults at an aquarium geared toward young children, it's definitely a little pricey. If it's not super busy I think you could get through almost everything in 4 hours, unless you want to watch all the auditorium videos too. However I love supporting animal welfare and research so I think it's well worth it, especially if you haven't been!"
3,2020-02-19,3,"I came here for my first time in 2005 and it was AMAZING! Like seriously over the top mind blowing.  There was a Chihuly exhibit in the jellyfish area and it was spectacular.  Maybe that is what made this last trip fall in comparison?  I went for the day with some friends and it was meh at best in my humble opinion (January 2020).  I'm not a huge fish tank person; I appreciate nature in general and see the value of a spot like this for people to learn and get up close to so many species we'd otherwise never be able to get close to see in person.  It was very busy, I don't have kids, and they were all over the place like little wild animals.  It was sensory overload for me I guess.  The fish were cool, otters the best, and of course the view is lovely.  Maybe going on a Saturday was a mistake, and later in the day no less.  The jellyfish area is still cool, but compared to the exhibit in 2005 where it was at least 3 times the size it was OK at best.  It's hard not to compare, so my opinion is clearly skewed.  Some of my friends LOVED it during our January visit, but I ended up leaving early with another couple friends and heading up the street for a drink and to enjoy a kid free space.  I'm glad I went but I guess I'm cool for another 15 years, lol."
4,2020-02-11,5,"Great place to go for groups of all ages!  Note they no longer offer a AAA discount (as of Jan 2020) but they do offer military, veteran and student (with ID) discounts.  We had our family group of 5 for my husbands birthday on a Saturday.  It was busy but not too crowded.  We made it to a great video presentation in the auditorium and saw the feeding time for the penguins.  Fun!  The displays are beautifu!. I think my favorite are thee jelly fish.  I lingered there thee longest.  Another favorite spot is the outdoor tidal area they have plenty of space to sit outside and rest your feet, get some fresh coastal air and take in the view before resuming your tour"
5,2020-01-27,4,"Cool place to visit. It has been on my bucket list for 20 some years. ... it was better in my mind :).It costs about 50bucks for an adult ticket. It is actually smaller than I expected, way smaller. There are plenty of exhibits to keep you easily busy for 5 hours. There are a few live video presentations. For the rambunctious kid there are two petting ponds and a mini jungle gym to tire them out. A restaurant too... which I thought was odd given the size of the aquarium. Also, I counted 3 seperate shops (or 4) which were again, too many.   Put more aquariums....I did like that it gave attention to the small marine life by their use of lightning, aquarium magnifying effects, and in a few occasions u can interact with the aquarium by either introducing light or water current.There are a few large aquariums... I wanted to see the Sun Fish. The largest fish I saw was about the size of a man. My favorite section was the octopus aquariums.Personally I thing the aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is better. The outside beach view at Monterey Bay Aquarium has no equal... it is gorgeous BUT you can see that view all around Monterey Bay anyway.... I wonder if they could build an underwater walkway out into the bay... about 1000feet at least... that would be amazing.Either way, if you come to Monterey Bay, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a cool spot to visit."
6,2020-01-29,5,"What a great Aquarium! I can't believe I haven't been here before, and I live so close too! My family and I had a blast here. First, we went to the Otter feeding and we found that very interesting. If you want to watch this feeding I recommend getting there right at opening, it gets crowded and makes viewing hard. Also, make sure you are on the mezzanine level, we found out you don't get to see much from the lower lever. It is still pretty cool however and they provide tv screens showing you what's going on above if you do get stuck down here as we did. The real highlight of the trip however was The Open Sea feeding, it was breathtaking. There really wasn't a bad seat either, they really have crowd control down for this show. It was really spectacular watching all the fish swarm the food, especially the sardines.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is as good as it gets as far as Aquariums go, there really isn't much more to say about it that hasn't already been said. Definately worth your time."
7,2020-02-22,5,"Got a 2 day pass.  If you don't want to wait in long lines, get your tickets ahead of time!  Aquarium closes at 5pm.  Came in around 3pm and it was plenty of time for us to see everything in the aquarium.  We Liked having the photo opportunity towards the end cause most of the crowds cleared out and we took advantage of the open spaces. Huge fan of the Jelly Fish exhibits, sea otters, Kelp Forrest and the tropical fishes.  I really liked that they placed an exhibit about the trash that is endangering our oceans. We need to take better care of our oceans and having more awareness of the beautiful wonderful creatures that live there.  So many families and great educational exhibits and experience for the youth.  Perfect place for a date or a family field trip.  Be kind to each other, help others take selfies, don't trash our oceans and recycle!!"
8,2020-01-08,4,"It's hard to offer anything but praise to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, with its commitment to research, conservation, public education on sustainable fishing practices, and hands on interaction with sea life.As a scuba diver, their walls of underwater life come as close to approximating the feeling of being twenty feet under the water as you'll find outside of grabbing a wetsuit and your oxygen tank.  From  education, to hands on experimentation in the touch tidepool areas, to committed volunteers and workforce, clearly this is a world class facility.It is also an expensive proposition at $50 a person ($40 for students), which can be cost prohibitive and create an access issue for some families. While I realize the money for admission goes back to support their mission, facilities, and talented staff, the level of crowding on busy days seems to be a weak link, making it difficult to navigate through the relatively small facility, vis a vie the crowd size.  They'd benefit from a reservations system and capping the crowds here, as on the day we attended crowds outpaced the capacity of their facility, impacting  the enjoyment and experience of their guests."
9,2020-02-18,5,"Best Aquarium in the States! Monterey Bay Aquarium is widely known for a reason, because its great selection of sea creatures and big Tanks. Just became members and am mot sure why I didt become one earlier. Great deal!"
10,2020-01-02,5,"A premier aquarium showcasing sea life from the Monterey Bay situated right off shore the California coast.  What makes The MBA so unique?  How about a deep underwater valley right off shore that brings rich deepwater nutrients and plankton right to the surface.   Thus the abundance of sea life close to shore.For you movie buffs, the aquarium was the setting for the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home released in 1986.  The Star Trek crew was tasked to bring two Humpback Whales to space... wIld...So you want to visit?  There is free residential parking south towards Pacific Grove, metered street parking close by, or pay parking lots a few blocks away.  If you park near Pacific Grove, you'll walk by sea lions lounging in a protective cove immediately south of the aquarium.Favorite Exhibits:- Two Story Kelp Forest Exhibit, large Kelp plants swaying with the current with large and small fish at different depths, seawater pumped and filtered from offshore- Open Ocean Tank, open deep sea fish tank that has previously housed a Great White Shark, Tiger Shark, Hammerhead Sharks, Large Sea Turtles, and rare Ocean Sunfish.  Lots of open water fish.  They had to release the sharks in the past as they kept crashing into spots where they detected an electrical anomaly- Ocean Jellies, jelly fish of all kinds...mesmerizing - Puffin Exhibit, those sea birds swim fast and crazy- Bat Ray Touch Pool, you can touch if they come near you- Two Story Sea Otter Exhibit, saw four in the tank, you can see some in the wild from the aquarium balcony- Enclosed Beach Aviary, rescued sea birds and surf fishAnd more...Plan on at least 3 hours at the MBA."
11,2020-01-03,5,"The whole reason why we decided to drive out to SF was to stop by Monterey for this Aquarium. Beware you have to work a bit far and walk down, I think parking was around $15 in a garage nearby.Admission is a bit pricey around $50 per adult. But we heard such great things about it we had to check it out. Holy Moly this place is amazing!!!! Huge I mean humongous tanks of colorful fish, sharks, sea turtles and everything else you can imagine under the sea, 2 floors of packed fun and kids play space, indoor cafeteria, and an outdoor ocean view. We loved it! My favorite was def the open sea and jelly fishes. Truly an amazing experience and highly recommended.Also, once done, you can walk down the street to the beach area and come great restaurants with amazing views!"
12,2020-01-09,5,So we can up to Monterey on a Monday to visit the area. We did a stop by the aquarium. What a big difference it make if the kids are in school. It was really nice to enjoy this place without all of the crowds during the summer months. I would highly recommend this place during the off season.
13,2019-12-31,5,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! When I used to live in Santa Cruz, this was a go to destination for me. I would love to just stand in front of the kelp forest and get lost in the motions. The sea otters and penguins are fun to watch. The deep ocean with the hammerhead sharks, sun fish, tuna, some times a sea turtle...I also enjoy their special exhibits. This time around, we went to the Tentacles exhibit and looked at the octopus, garden eels, and other mesmerizing creatures. My niece and nephew loved the touch pool where they could touch seaweed, sea grass, kelp, sea urchin, sea stars and abalone shells. They have hand sanitizer and paper towels to clean your hands with afterwards. If you are a member, you can use the member entrance for a quicker entry. Members also can enter normally an hour earlier than the general public. Make sure that you stamp your hand so that you can re-enter. They will check your hand with black light. You will need to park in a public lot or on the street since they do not have onsite parking. They do have a cafe if you're hungry. They also have gift shops with cute stuffed animals, books, mugs, keychains, glass sculptures, etc."
14,2019-12-31,5,"This is my happy place.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is by far the best aquarium I've been to in California. I've gone here ever since I was a little girl, and will continue to go for years to come. The aquarium have a vast variety of sea life stemming from the tiniest of microorganisms all the way to gigantic sunfish. There is always something for every aquatic lover to enjoy.My favorite part of this aquarium is the open sea exhibit. There is a bottom layer and you can also seat yourself higher in the ""bleachers"" to gaze at the schools of fish and occasional shark roaming by. Tip; if you are a student, tickets are discounted from the usual $49.95 to $39.95, so always bring that ID when getting your tickets!"
15,2020-01-13,4,"It's expensive, but I guess this is a good cause if you are having to put your money somewhere! It's probably best for kids over the age of 5 - not that younger kids won't enjoy it, but it's pricey for littler attention spans.  That said, they have feedings of various animals at regular times as well as 15 minute videos in their auditoriums that help break up the day.  The cafe is also surprisingly good.  Note: bring your own mug if you want to get coffee because they don't have take away cups (low waste - hooray!!)."
16,2020-02-08,5,"If you ever go the Monterey Bay, be sure to spend a few hours here. I go back every time I'm in town. I grew up in Seaside and visited the aquarium several times in my life. I live in Illinois now, but always see the Aquarium every time I go home. Always new exhibits and the staff is always enthusiastic and helpful. I even lost my wallet while I was there last time and they held it for me until I came back and claimed it. The jellyfish exhibit has only gotten better and the entire place looks like it got a great makeover. My favorite is the shows they offer several times day about the history of the Monterey Bay, and its fisherman."
17,2020-02-28,5,"Most exciting place! Education, activities, amazing sea life, kids area, outdoor decking to enjoy the views and natural settings. Must See!! They also have food for people! Fanshows, animal feedings, history of the area and Touch tank for everyone"
18,2019-12-25,5,"Beautiful, educational, extensive and fun!! A little pricey but the stuff that you see makes it worth it. Lots of new facts about the residents of the ocean and wonderful to learn about the conservation efforts undertaken. We were 2 adults and it took us about 3 hours to finish seeing the exhibits. If you include the movies, it'll probably take you another 1-1.5 hours. Book your tickets online to avoid standing in line which was pretty long when we got there. Also, if you're going to partake discounts/promos, they recommend online tickets as they don't accept those at on-site booking. Parking is in the public parking lot $15 for the day. Would recommend that or just cabbing it as street parking is tough and only for 2 hours."
19,2020-02-29,4,This is a fun couple of hours for the family.  It has interactive areas where you can touch animals.  Lots of employees/volunteers to teach you about the animals.   The cafe is really good with tons of options.
20,2019-11-28,5,"This is my second visit to the Aquarium, but I guess the first time I was not on Yelp so my first review.  Firstly all the staff that works there, mostly volunteers are so friendly and helpful.  The exhibits themselves are superb, with a great variety of sea life, including sea otters and penguins. I think my favorites were the jellyfish with such a great amount of different types there were all so interesting to see.  Excellent place to go and if you have kids take along. They have a pretty good cafe as well, but we only got coffee there that day."
21,2019-12-17,4,"Get there early! We arrived 15 minutes after the aquarium opened and boy am I glad we did. Is it the best aquarium I've been to? Probably not in terms of the kinds and number of fish. However, I do feel that the experience we had was one of the best. This place is geared to educate through experience and their dedication to research and conservation was loud and clear. I felt that they are doing such relevant research and they want to inform their patrons of their research. I wish I would have known this before going and make a plan that I'd sit through all the presentations at the auditorium. They also had good food at the food court/ cafeteria. The burgers looked good. Unfortunately I did not get it."
22,2019-12-05,4,"The aquarium is super well kept and the overall experience is great. However it is a bit smaller than you would think for a world renowned aquarium. Things are very spacious, but I think they could use more aquatic life vs kid demos. Again- it's a great experience that I would do again so you won't regret going - especially if you have children. It's also not the cheapest so for two people you are looking at over $100 for the both of you. And then if you buy any food or souvenirs the price tag can increase quickly."
23,2019-10-31,5,"It was our first family trip with a baby, a tween, 2 teens and 2 senior citizens. You know what, we brought the whole crew ok. Anyhow, we reached the aquarium and saw this looong line. 5 min later we were already at the ticket counter grabbing our tickets! Tall about fast! Our whole family loved the aquarium. There were interactive, hands on activies. My teens even loved it. There was also scheduled feedings for the fish, penguins and otters. There was so much to see! My favorite was the open ocean, where you could see jelly fish and the HUMUNGOUS aquarium with all big ocean creatures. It was pretty cool! My kids loved it all! We were there for a couple of hours and they still didn't want to leave. So if you come, have at least 3 hours planned just to look amd enjoy. Overall, this was the highlight of our road trip to Monterey. It is fun for all ages, 0 to 99!"
24,2020-01-25,5,This is a great aquarium and an obligatory stop to make if you are in Monterey. My favorite part of this aquarium are the otters and penguins but they also have a nice hands on area (the splash zone) that kids from 3 and up will likely really enjoy. We had fun here this time around and I've always enjoyed coming to this aquarium since I was a kid so I definitely recommend it.
25,2019-11-08,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is probably the best aquarium I've been since I was a kid. This aquarium is an ocean conservatory in Monterey, CA. The entrance fee is a little less than $50, but if you have AAA, a student, or a senior, you can get a discount. To be honest the price is  the only thing that turned me off about this aquarium. This aquarium has cute otters, fishes and sharks, shellfishes, penguins, and other sea creatures. We learned so much about these sea animals. We also enjoyed touching some plants. They have shows where they feed the animals. We enjoyed our visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium. Although I think that the place was small and pricey, I love their mission. I'm looking forward to visit again soon."
26,2019-10-30,4,"Baby Shark Doo Doo Doo!Monterey Bay Aquarium is probably the most popular site and attractions in Monterey. One of the bigger aquariums I have been too.Street meter parking, $1 per hour, max 4 hours at the meters by the aquarium. Some meters further away are 2 hours only. Adult Admission is $49.95. Kiddos were free. Busy even on a random weekday at opening. We lined up at 9:50 am and the line was about 30 people deep. Prepaying does not let you skip the line outside. You still have to wait in the normal line queue.Tons of different exhibits inside. Spread out nicely. Two levels. The otter section was super popular. Always had crowds. I was a fan of the Open Sea area. The bright jelly fish were awesome. I also liked the canning area right in front. Pretty neat.The kids area was great. Lots of interactive things to do and play with.And if your kid is a fan of sharks, they are placed all over the aquarium. Gift shop was super pricey. Very stressful but enjoyable 2 hours until the kiddos broke down! :)"
27,2020-01-01,5,Probably the best aquarium on the west coast.  They do fantastic work for environmental protection.  This is a top site for anyone visiting Monterey.  It's a little expensive to go but worth it to see the exhibits and help contribute to the conservation efforts.  It gets very busy so plan accordingly.
28,2019-11-09,5,"There's nothing I don't love about this place. Spend a few hours here, be educated on the animals by friendly keepers, shows, and signage and enjoy great views of their animals!I absolutely love sea otters and really enjoy the sea otter feeding and seeing it up close. If you want a good spot for the feeding on a weekend or on a crowded day, show up a little early to get a good spot!"
29,2020-01-01,5,"I adore the aquarium! I have been to the aquarium many times and love all that it has to offer. The exhibits are all extremely well done and the feedings are well spaced out so you can see them all, no problem. The exhibits tend to be crowded, so definitely be patient (especially at the otters) with those around you. It is certainly worth it to take your time. At the feeding the presenter will ask everyone in the front to sit on the floor, ensuring that everyone has a chance at seeing everything, so less to worry about there. The outdoor viewing deck is definitely worth a bit of time as well. There are otters, dolphins, and more to see and you will likely see something. The food at the cafe is pricey, but good. If you don't want to wait in the line, you can come and go (as long as you get a hand stamp) from the aquarium, the prices likely won't be too much better outside the aquarium though. Definitely go see all that the aquarium has to offer, it is more than worth it!"
30,2020-01-18,5,"If you're ever anywhere near Monterey, definitely pay this aquarium a visit.  A lot of typical marine animals, but the layout of the building and exhibits is so well designed that it adds to the experience, not to mention how clean the place is.  My kid loved the touch pools and sea bird exhibits. Unfortunately, the aquarium is right in the middle of Cannery Row, which is nothing but a tourist trap that needs to try harder.  Avoid all that."
31,2020-01-07,5,"I was so excited to come here, one of the best aquariums I've ever been too. Its very large and we spent most of the day there. We also got to go on a behind the scenes tour and feed the trout and  fish in the kelp forest. The gift shops and cafeteria were nice as well. Fortunately, we did not have trouble finding a parking spot; we found a nearby parking meter and the hubster just had to add money to it every couple of hours. My favorite exhibits were Kelp Forest, The Open Seas and Tentacles. Monterey Bay Aquarium is indeed very crowded and annoying at times. However, I would definitely pay to come here again because there is so many amazing ocean creatures to see."
32,2019-10-18,5,"I'd give it 10 stars! It's a bit pricey, but a GREAT CAUSE TO SUPPORT! If you stay all day, like I DO, it's totally worth it. Be sure to sign up for text alerts when you get there & look up the feeding times to plan your visit around. Also, if ticket line is really long, get on your phone & buy there - - then breeze past the line! My absolute favorite area is the jellyfish! SO SO RELAXING & such fascinating creatures! Besides the ""famous"" Sea Nettle species, I couldn't take my eyes off the Spotted comb & Sea Gooseberry ones! They just don't look real! And the Ocean Sun Fish is HUGE & looks PREHISTORIC!  Stop reading & plan your trip to experience it all for yourself!"
33,2020-02-07,5,"I grew up visiting the aquarium and have always loved it. Now that I am older with my own kids, they have fallen in love with the place and ask to go every year."
34,2019-12-29,5,"Absolutely stunning. I am still in awe. You hear it's the best and greatest, but once you experience it you'll really know what all the raving is all about. We purchased tickets from our hotel nearby so we skipped the line which wasn't too long on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm. BUT it was very crowded. We thought coming later would help us avoid the busiest time of day but it was very crowded. Still were able to enjoy our time. The jelly fish and sea otters were my absolute favorite. I could sit there and watch them for hours. Yes the tickets are pricey but let me tell you, well worth it!"
35,2019-10-19,5,"Love this Aquarium!! So much to see! As soon as you think you've seen everything, you turn a corner and there is a whole other section to explore. It is very easy to spend all day here. I love that they have an open ocean exhibit, not many aquariums have this. There are sea otters, jelly fish, sting rays, octopus, small sharks, a sea turtle, many tropical fish, animals in the desert biome, a variety of sea birds, penguins and more! I love that all the exhibits are large and all the animals look healthy. They seem well taken care of. When you arrive they give you a pamphlet that includes the schedule of all the animal feedings for the day and the times for the shows in the auditorium. There also are guided tours for people 6yrs old+ that cost extra ($15 per person, $12 for members). We did not go on a tour. There is a cafe in the aquarium but it is ridiculously overpriced so we dined elsewhere for lunch. As far as parking is concerned, there is a paid parking garage with a free trolley that takes you to the aquarium. We decided to park on the street. It was metered but only cost around $5 for the whole time we were there. l recommend this aquarium to families and people without kids too! Can't wait to come back."
36,2019-09-07,5,"Before you read this whole review, if you need to hear one thing, GO TO THIS AQUARIUM ASAP!! I have been looking forward to going to this aquarium for months now and it definitely did not disappoint. Although the prices are a bit steep, it goes to a great cause so I am not upset one bit nor should you. If this is holding you back, PULL THE TRIGGER AND GO! This is one of the only aquarium with a real kelp forest and pulls in real seawater. That to me is an amazing concept. Not only this, it's one of the few aquariums that have sun fish! There are numerous photo opportunities throughout the aquarium and the exhibits will take a few hours to go through. The walkways are a bit confusing as there are multiple levels and some exhibits you need to go up a floor only to go back down on the other side, but it didn't bother me as it felt like I discovered something new and got excited about it. I cannot stress this enough, check the Monterey Bay Aquarium out!!!!"
37,2019-08-20,5,"It's unbelievable of all the years that I have been living in the City Of San Francisco Ca USA!!! I have never been neither to San Francisco Bay Aquarium of San Francisco Ca nor the Monterey Bay Aquarium of Monterey Ca!!! The drought has finally ended... I came here with my family to the Monterey Bay Aquarium last Thursday on August 15th 2019 in the afternoon!!!As I first walked into the Monterey Bay Aquarium... I was really interested to see all kinds Fishes Around The World!!! But my most favorite Fish that I really like most seeing is the Tropical Fish from the Bahamas and like the the ones you would see in the Japanese Tea Gardens... There was also Penguins which was another of my most favorite thing that... I like seeing!!! Other than those things that I saw!!! I also had a chance to see Sharks, Octopus, Jelly Fish, Star Fish, Sting Rays, up close!!!I have to tell you when I saw them Jelly Fish it feels like when I watch the Sponge Bob Square Pants Cartoon when Sponge Bob Square Pants touches them Jelly Fish and guess what happens he gets electrocuted!!! But in real life don't try touching them Jelly Fish they will cause damage to your skin!!! Now that, I finally had the chance of going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium of Monterey Ca USA!!! All I can say is that this is really fun place to visit and to see all kinds exotic fishes from every place around the world!!! To all those yelpers and non yelpers... I highly recommend the Monterey Bay Aquarium of Monterey Ca USA as a place to go to!!!Just take a look at my posted pictures and videos of the Monterey Bay Aquarium of Monterey Ca USA and you know what I am talking about!!!"
38,2019-12-24,5,"Fantastic aquarium with lots of cool exhibits, shows, and some pretty massive fish tanks! They have the famous jellyfish against blue background you may have seen online a bunch (attached). There's also a (rescue) sea otter feeding show which is absolutely adorable (aside: I wish I could eat fresh fish off my belly all day). Great for kids, and has a nice view of the ocean out back."
39,2019-12-18,5,"We had come here many years ago, but recently theyhad a ' open house'( free ticket) to tri countyresidents. We waited in a long line and 15 minutes later were inside the aquarium. Staff were veryfriendly and helpful. Great exhibits of the Open Seaand the wonderful jellyfish displays. Beautiful!So much to see."
40,2019-07-26,5,Amazing aquarium. I thought my kids would last maybe 2-3 hours and after 6 hours we were the tired ones. Outstanding employees and demos. It was high season so it was really busy. I think my 8 year got more excited here than he did at Disneyland. Loved all the exhibits. The reef exhibit was his favorite. So many different levels to see it on. The feedings were very busy but neat to watch.
41,2019-08-04,4,"Such a beautiful facility with many educational standpoints on marine life. I definitely recommend this to adults and parents that have kids a little bit older (maybe 5+) to fully appreciate the overall activities in the aquarium. There are a lot of hands-on sections throughout the aquarium that teach things ranging from different types of kelp to how waves are formed to how to pet a bat ray.Granted, places like these are all about timing. I have been to the aquarium several times during different parts of the year and have had very different experiences with each visit. When it is quiet, I like to sit and listen to music while I appreciate the Deep Sea section and the Kelp Forest. I especially enjoy spending time watching the jellies. When it is crowded, it's difficult to sit and relax since there are so many people. But! It doesn't mean you cannot enjoy your time there. You basically are in control of your own experience. Take pictures! Without flash of course. Enjoy the scenery. Sit in the theater and educate yourself about sharks and otters. Attend the feedings and take in all the amazing facts about the fish. Bring your student ID! It is a $10 discount.And don't forget to bring a reusable water bottle. Cause it gets hot in there and you'll be thirsty.There is a parking garage close by. It is $18 for the entire day. Enjoy your trip and make sure you take your time!"
42,2019-07-23,3,"This was a very overrated place to go to. It is basically just a tourist attraction. There is not so much to see or  do that is worth the exaggerated entrance fee of now $40 a person. For a family of four we ended up paying $150. If you are a student there is a small discount. Children have to pay $30. Adults have to pay $40. You're better off if possible purchasing the annual fee which we ended up doing. it will save you so much more money in the long run especially if you are going with a group. Just pay the annual fee this way you can go whenever and at least get your money's worth otherwise it's not that big of a deal to come here. I would rather enjoy all the beaches, wharf, view points, hikes, and the little shops in the area."
43,2020-01-28,5,"This is place is a must visit when in the Monterey Carmel area. I've been visiting the aquarium almost monthly for the past 2 years since my son loves seeing all the animals. Even after 20+ visits he still loves to go and see everything. The single day tickets can be pricey but becoming a member is great value. With the Oceans Advocate package you get two  adults, children/grandchildren, and two transferable guest cards that your friends and family can reuse. I also believe you can add up to 7 or so children/grandchildren up to 21. When people use the guest cards you don't have to present for them to use them. The exhibits have been the same for several years but you can always find something new that you never noticed when walking around. The penguins, open ocean, jelly fish, and baja exhibits stand out as must sees when visiting. The feeding times at each exhibit area also worth seeing at least once. If you want to avoid the crowds visiting on a weekday or seeing exhibits opposite of feeding times is the way to go. I would bring snacks if you have little ones as the food options are limited at the aquarium. If you get there before 10am you can find cheaper meter parking on the street.If you need something to do on a weekday with younger kids the aquarium is the place to go!"
44,2019-08-21,5,"We loved stopping into the aquarium while visiting Monterey. It has many interactive exhibits and is surrounded by great places to eat and shop. My favorite area was the extensive jelly fish aquariums. I could sit and watch them for forever. One thing I didn't like is that they do not offer a teacher discount. If I had to choose between this aquarium and the Atlanta, I'd choose Atlanta. I still think it is a great visit and worth seeing if you are in the area!"
45,2019-12-08,5,"This is an amazing aquarium that actually cares about the animals in their care. It looks small from the outside, but it's bigger than you think once you enter. The staff are excellent and are incredibly knowledgeable. I highly encourage chatting them up - there are some incredible stories and facts to learn about our ocean creatures. They are there to share their passion and educate the public!The price of admission is steep, and there aren't really any coupons/sales. A few ideas:1. Some Airbnb's offer free guest passes though sometimes they require you stay a certain number of nights. 2. Some hotels will offer a promotion to let you get the passes for 2 days for the price of 1 day. 3. Befriend someone who has a family membership and has 2 guest passes to lend. 4. Get your own membership and be an ocean advocate ;) At the very least, this is a conservatory and they actually care about their animals. It's not going to some for-profit that seeks to profit off of caged animals.The displays are quite incredible - jellyfish is beautifully lit. The otters are adorable. Watching the sea turtles in the huge tank is so relaxing. The programs put on with a live narration are incredibly well timed and engaging. The view of the coast is breathtaking, and I'm partial to the white rock outside that is white because of all the birds who relieve themselves on it. I've always parked on the street. I would be cautious about the parking regulations and meters as the area is combed through carefully by parking police."
46,2019-09-14,4,"Discounted tickets available for 65 yrs and above.  The cashier was unimpressed by the fact that I would be 65 one day. :)This is an exceptionally great place to take kids - educational opportunities in every direction geared toward children.  They also offer lectures, delivered at more of an adult level, in the auditorium throughout the day.  I recommend that you sit in for a few.There is a great observation area for seeing the sea otters at play.  This kept me busy for the better part of an hour.  As an adult, I can say that for me, one visit is sufficient.  If you have kids and live near enough to come a few times a year, the family membership makes good sense."
47,2019-07-08,3,"I love Aquariums....so much so that when I'm traveling across the country for business or pleasure I typically try to make time to visit them in whatever place I'm in. Georgia Acquarium in the ATL , National Acquarium in Baltimore and Shedd in the CHI are some of my faves. I remember going to the MBA as a kid and had fond fond memories. I returned recently and while I enjoyed myself  I can't bring myself to give it more than a 3 star rating. $50 a pop to get in but the aquarium is very modern and spacious.  I like to get places early so when we showed up near opening hours it was busy but not overwhelming. Parking can be a hassle but once again  since we got there early it was not an issue. My favorite exhibit was the jelly fish. Solid solid venue but I went with the three only because I thought to myself if I had a friend here from out of town for a few days would I insist they make the 2 hour drive to Monterey just to go to this place....(ehhh). If you like my reviews, consider ""following"" my profile for reviews all across the SF Bay Area. Why ""follow"" someone?  It causes the person you follow's reviews to tier to top when you pull up a business. I find this very handy when researching venues.  Also have a link on my profile page to my newly created gram.Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base it on the likelihood of a return visit and I try to be stingy with 5 star reviews since they should be ""special"" in my eyes. Price/Value also play a role. Just because a steak is $75 doesn't make it a 4 or 5 star venue nor does a $1 taco unless it's delicious. 5 stars - ""I'll go out of my way"" (approx 6 % of my reviews)  4 stars- ""If I was in the area I'd go here and would recommend"", (approx 38% of my reviews)  3 stars ""Maybe if was nearby"", (approx 37% of my reviews) 2 stars -""Would likely not return, Only if you want to go"", (approx 16% of my reviews)  1 star -""No thanks, even if I was hungry"", (approx. 3 % of my reviews)"
48,2019-12-09,5,"I have been going to this aquarium since I was a little girl and I'm now 25, this is a place for all ages! I was amazed at the renovations they have done over the years. I'd have to say the jelly fish were my favorite by far! They have a food court and plenty of restrooms throughout. And if your lucky you can see sea otters and dolphins from the viewing decks outside. It's a must see attraction if your visiting the area!"
49,2019-12-08,5,"We finally had the chance to visit this aquarium on our second trip to Monterey and Carmel by the sea. This place gets busy everyday full of tourists from near and far and locals like the kids who attend nearby.My favorite spot here is the sea otter, the touch pool and of course the cool invisible sea creations like the electric jellyfish.  Be sure to give yourself at least a minimum of 2 hours to see everything, touch everything, and partake in everything. My husband and I wanted to make sure we saw everything here since we drove from Los Angeles and we made a trip out of this  aquarium. Just be sure to come here first thing in the morning and reserve a spot online prior to heading in here otherwise you'll be in the long general line just to get in."
50,2019-11-11,5,"Tickets are about $50 for adults regular price and $29.99 for kids aged 3-12. Luckily, we found a corporate discount from my husband's company site and my husband received a free ticket as a veteran during Veteran's Day so we saved about $80! The aquarium is so beautiful with nice big tanks and wonderful relaxing music. I wish I can just sleep in there. I think it's worth visiting and you see so many shops and businesses nearby so plan to have some lunch and dinner afterwards. They also have a Cafe inside of the aquarium too!"
51,2019-11-08,5,It's the biggest aquarium in Northern California- I recommend open water part the most - deep blue background with glowing jellyfish and phytoplankton:) magical
52,2019-11-15,5,"I entered for free, they let Veterans in free on Veterans Day.  I was in the Navy for six years.  It's a great aquarium.  For those with kids there's a lot of children's activities.  While there I watched two feeding times.  I enjoyed that.  My favorite part of visiting aquariums are watching the jellyfish and there here too.-----The negative is the steep regular price, 49.95.  As a comparison The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is 35.95 and I think that is an outstanding aquarium.  Another great aquarium I've been to is the one in Omaha, Nebraska.  The price there varies depending on the season but the highest price is 21.95 AND it includes the zoo admission.  That aquarium is in the middle of the zoo.  I state this so the readers can be aware as they make their own decision."
53,2020-02-04,5,"Gorgeous exhibits , stunning jellyfish displays, playful sweet otters, this place makes my heart SING!  wow! What a wonderful way to spend the afternoon, a must see of you've got kids - or are just looking to see some sights in Monterey. They are very conscious of the welfare of all their animals at Monterey bay aquarium, and for the conservation of the natural habitats outside their establishment! Very impressed  by the knowledge and courtesy of the staff too, and the little cafe was adorable. Got some big sur cooking salts I can't wait to try! Love this place."
54,2019-06-14,5,Monterey Bay Aquarium opened in 1984 in what was a sardine cannery.  I visited with my kid in 2004.  It was quieter back then.  The aquarium was the first to feature a living kelp forest.  Now huge crowds gather to watch things like sea otters eat.  The displays are much more elaborate.  Many more varieties of sea life to see.  There is an incredible view of Monterey Bay outside.  That day like today it was raining and cold.  We walked through Cannery Row.   It was named in January 1958 to honor John Steinbeck.   Last cannery closed in 1973.Much has changed over the years.  But this day we walked together and marveled at the wonders beneath the sea at Monterey Bay Aquarium as we did back in 2004.
55,2020-02-17,5,"Great aquarium. Full of interesting animals and engaging experiences. I went yesterday (the 16th) extremely crowded. There were many tourists disobeying rules, but were quickly put to a stop by staff who were very polite and friendly who would answers any questions. I recommend this aquarium for anyone stopping by town, or just looking for a great experience."
56,2019-12-29,4,"Such a fun time! We bought our tickets from the hotel we were staying at and got there right around 9:30 on a Friday. The aquarium was already pretty crowded when we got there, and only got more crowded during the day. In general, the aquarium wasn't very big -- depending on how fast you go through the exhibits, you could get through them all in several hours. We spent most of the morning going to the live feedings that they have scheduled throughout the day. It doesn't really matter if you get there early to wait for a good spot at the front because they usually end up making the first few rows take a seat and have people who want to stand move toward the back (except for the sea otter feeding, which is also probably the most popular, so I would recommend getting there a little earlier for that). I found that generally, moving up toward the balcony/top levels provided a clearer view of the tank. The kelp forest feeding was my favorite! It's the only one with a diver inside of the tank, and it's pretty cool to see all the fish swarming around him waiting to be fed. As for the exhibits, I felt like the highlights were the jellyfish and the special exhibit on tentacles which includes octopuses. Those felt really specially to this aquarium in particular, and were some of the most unique parts of it. The giant pacific octopus especially left me in awe - never have I seen an octopus so active before! But in terms of size and quality of shows, I feel like the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago comes out on top. Worth a trip if you are a fan of marine life. Be aware that because the aquarium isn't huge, it does get crowded very easily so try to get there early. If you plan to watch most of the live feedings and the shows in the auditorium, you may end up spending the entire day there (you can leave and re-enter, however). I spent about 6 hours and felt like I hit pretty much everything in the aquarium."
57,2019-07-27,5,"This place truly takes my breath away every single visit. Don't be fooled by the name Monterey Bay Aquarium. This place is so much more than just an aquarium. It's an aquarium, planetarium, and a natural history museum. Nestled in the corner of Cannery Row this place is bursting with life.My favorite exhibit is the Jellies. They are so mesmerizing and beautiful. They have different types of jellies at this location. My kiddo enjoys all the interactive exhibits and all the different animals.This aquarium has something for everyone in the family. When it's not very busy you can take your time to thoroughly enjoy the exhibits. They also host events that are really fun to attend.The aquarium is a family friendly environment full of life."
58,2019-07-10,5,"There is something for every kind of ocean-loving human here. You find penguins and otters adorable? Boom--you're in luck! Fancy a shark or sea turtle sighting? Done and done! Need a break to sit down in a theater and watch animals on the big screen? Check! I absolutely adore this place, and my boyfriend and I were really into exploring every square inch! Last Saturday was our first visit together, and rather than waiting in the insanely long line outside to purchase tickets, we opted to grab them online while we stood at the entrance and even got the AAA $5 off/ticket discount. I held out the barcode for the woman to scan on my phone, and when it didn't work, she physically walked us to an info desk inside, reassuring us that sometimes, it takes a beat for tickets purchased online to be able to be scanned at the aquarium. The fact that she took the time to actually bring us over, noting that we needn't worry, was so nice and seemed like such a rare gesture when it was so crazy crowded. We spent four hours perusing, snapping pictures, being in awe and saying, ""Oooo look at this!"" There were touch-and-feel areas, multiple gift shops, scuba feedings and cleanings and so much more. It was such a great day and took me back to my childhood dream of becoming a marine biologist, after becoming obsessed with seaQuest DSV (anyone remember that awesome show with Jonathan Brandis, R.I.P?)You can't come to Monterey without experiencing all the aquarium has to offer! It's worth the entrance price, and if you have AAA, take advantage and get your tickets beforehand."
59,2019-08-07,5,"As a rule I'm not one for aquariums, however this is exceptional!In scope, presentation and selection, this is an exceptional aquarium.Despite the crowds I never felt crowed!The visit was a most enjoyable day trip from San Francisco and worth the time and expense."
60,2019-06-18,5,"Love this place! Let's get the negatives out of the way first....expensive, crowded, and hard to find parking. But wow! Gorgeous views of the pacific ocean from almost every area of the aquarium, plus all of the exhibits they have to offer! I love the rotating exhibits too. Not only do they educate about our oceans, they help promote cleaner living and conservation. I ended up getting a membership for how many people we have join us and for how often we go. Totally worth the money."
61,2019-07-28,4,"What a magical place! Lots and lots of beautiful and fascinating exhibits. Not too crowded on the day we went so we had a relaxed visit. The most popular exhibit seemed to be the jellyfish. Flowing and colorful, it was almost hypnotic.Huge tank filled with such a variety of species from Hammerhead sharks to gigantic Groupers, ocean Sunfish, Moray eels and so much more. I think my favorite was the otter display, so cute and personable. My wife enjoyed the penguins quite a bit also.In our early 70s, it was very nice that there were frequent movies to sit and relax for a few minutes. Kind of nice also that as a retired military member, they gave us a nice discount. Lunch was also nice, not too expensive but not cheap, a nice variety of choices to grab a bite and relax.The only real issue was parking. Not a lot of parking close by. We were fortunate to find a street parking spot a couple blocks away. We decided to ""feed"" the meter four hours and made it back just in time. A shame since had we parked closer we would probably have stayed another hour or two."
62,2019-10-07,5,"Always a great time!! Sooo interesting and wonderful!! Staff are friendly and helpful, sealife is abundant, and reminds me to be aware of our oceans!!"
63,2019-12-30,3,"Honestly one of the best aquariums I've visited and definitely the best in California! Learnt quite a lot about marine life. I would definitely recommend visiting at least once if you're in the area or in California in general.The only complaint I had was about the staff member who greeted my friends and I upon entering. Her name was Jamie. She was holding a clear tube-like container of baby jellies and I enthusiastically asked if they were real because they were so tiny and cute. And she sarcastically responded with ""yes we have real fish here."" We kind of just chuckled at her response and she continued with ""ask stupid questions, you get stupid answers."" I'm really not sure who sh*t in her cereal this morning but that's no way to talk to customers. It's disgusting and tacky. I complained with the information desk and filled out a complaint/comment card (rightfully so). I hope the aquarium reprimands her and gives her a lesson or two on how to be a decent human being or at the very least, a decent employee. But yeah, overall go check it out! The aquarium is fantastic :)"
64,2019-06-02,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is probably one of my favorite aquariums I've been to in the U.S. (and I've been to many of the top aquariums in the Southeast - Georgia Aquarium, Chattanooga Aquarium, Miami Seaquarium, etc).Monterey Bay Aquarium was highly recommended to us during our visit and we weren't disappointed. It's located in an area to itself near the Cannery/Fisherman's Wharf area of Monterey.Tickets are $50 a person for adults. I thought it was a tad bid pricey at first, but after going, it was worth it to me. They're a not for profit aquarium and the money you spend goes back to helping the animals (they rescue the animals and release them when they are back to health). I also purchased my tickets through AAA, so I was able to get $5 off per ticket.The aquarium has two floors and is very expansive. Be sure to get the program guide when you go in so you can see the animal feeding times. I was so glad we were able to catch the sea otter feeding when we were there!Volunteers are all around the venue and are very friendly and willing to talk to you about each of the animals. The jellyfish, penguin, and sea otter areas were my favorites! You could also go outside on the balcony and they had telescopes and binoculars that guides would tell you where you could spot animals in the wild.We spent about 2-3 hours there and were so glad we did! If you need more time to come back, there are hand stamps at the exit where you could return for free the same day. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in Monterey!"
65,2019-09-30,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one that is often talked about by many sea fanatics. It's located in beautiful Coastal California with views of the bay and unfortunately sometimes rolling fog. This helps keep its charm and after checking it out with my group of students, I say that it's worth a trip but only if you got the monies.At $50 a head per adult entry, it is a steep reach even for the avid aquarium goer. There are discounts available if you come as a group and you may even consider buying an annual membership for $100, but it is indeed not cheap to visit.The exhibits here are beautifully laid out and interactive. There are a lot of educational pieces surrounding fishing sustainability and environmental protection which is great. Kids are given an entire section of the aquarium where they can touch and explore different sea critters, and the feeding times here are some of the best I've seen.For the price you pay, it's unfortunately a smaller aquarium than anticipated. But the detailed rooms and amazing sea animals that you experience is all worthwhile.Avoid the food court as it's busy and expensive, and any day of the week will have children on field trips or tourists from out of town. Carve out at least three hours to fully explore this beautiful aquarium."
66,2019-07-08,5,My little brother and I had about 3 hours to pal around in the aquarium. We got a lot done and saw most of the shows that were offered during that time. The sharks and the otters were our favorites. We took a lot of pictures and saw all of the animals in our 3 hours. We are eating spinach and artichoke dip in the court yard right now and it is delicious. We are gonna go check out a few more exhibits before the place closes at 6pm and go shop around in the surrounding town.
67,2019-11-06,5,"So much fun!  I've been coming here since I was a kid.  It opened when I was 10.  Moved to Oregon before having my son and brought him here on an epic family road trip.  We bought our tickets from our hotel because they gave an extra day free.  We didn't think we would use it, but we totally did.  Spent the day open to close and then bCk the next morning for 2 hrs to see what we had missed the previous day.Favorites:Shark show & Luna's Story in the auditorium.Painting fish exhibit in viva Baja Kids are upstairs in the splash zoneTide poolsMy son is 8 and LOVED it!  Great employees and volunteers make this a fun experience.  My son is very talkative and always has lots of questions.  They were wonderful with him.We learned so much!"
68,2020-02-18,5,"Still holds my kids attention year after year.  We've come annually for years and both kids, first and third grade, still insist upon going if we're in the area."
69,2019-06-21,5,"I love love LOVE the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Fun fact: I was living in Monterey in the 1st grade when this aquarium opened. So I've been going over the decades and have gotten to see it change and grow. And, well, it was fab from the get-go and just keeps getting more fab.There is a lot to see and do and touch and learn here. It is doable to do in a day or even slightly less than day. But if you want the full experience and want to enjoy all the exhibits and feedings and talks, plan accordingly.Pro-tip: Mornings are the busiest and late afternoons are the least busy (and the fewest strollers and tiny kids). You can also stamp your hand at the entrance/exit for same-day re-entry.The patience of all the staff in dealing with kids is amazing. They approach the kids and answer all their dumb questions. And they're great with adults too. I love how knowledgable they are and how much they can point out and tell you about all different things. It's quite impressive (and better than any other aquarium I've gone to).The kelp forest area is just so serene and peaceful when it's not crowded. A wonderful place to just sit and not think about anything at all and breathe and relax.Of course, the otters are a huge draw here. And they are quite cute. Expect a large crowd to gather at all the otter feedings. Bonus: The staff do try to make it so the crowd has to rotate and all the kids can get a chance to be able to actually see.I'm a big fan of the touch areas. Listen to the staff and you can learn so much. And there's way more to touch than just stingrays.I also LOVED the little faux diner and the video chefs talking about sustainable seafood, ethical fishing, which items to never order, etc. Has a foodie and huge proponent of sustainable seafood, it was super cool! If you don't already have one of their pocket sustainable seafood dining guides, be sure to pick up one here.There's even an area geared more to the teeny tots. Thinks lots of items to play with and tons of Nemo and Dory fishies.Parking is relatively easy as there are tons of parking garages around and a good amount of street parking (metered). There's also numerous restaurants and other things nearby.This really is the best aquarium you could go to! (And I've been so many from coast to coast.)"
70,2019-11-28,5,"A 'wow' experience is all I could say  especially the jelly fish was something I didn't expect  since I didn't have great expectations other than to entertain my kid and parents together in one place. I also had second thoughts before I bought the tickets since it's $50 per head. But ""this place is so worth our time and money"". Do visit if you can spare one day.On an added note they remind us of how we exploit nature unknowingly. Each straw we use matters, each cups we use matters, each spoons we use matters and it all affects the sea life so badly. Let's try to conserve nature trying to at-least reduce the disposables we use"
71,2019-09-19,5,"You get what you pay for....everyone has heard that one before. Well I have to say Monterey Bay Aquarium falls in that category. It is truly a world of wonder and doesn't disappoint. It is a 5 star experience all the way from kiddos to grandparents and everyone in between its a great way to spend a day. I would say the parking issue is really the only drawback as you must figure out how to find any public parking that isn't full or crazy expensive. There is street parking a few blocks away if you don't mind feeding the meter every few hours and even that isn't convenient or inexpensive. After finding a spot we were off and in to visit, that would be my 9 year old daughter and I. We were deep into our first week long California coastal adventure and I knew the Aquarium was a must. Situated at the end of Cannery Row, this is one world class Aquarium. Each exhibit is filled with interactive, detailed yet engaging visitor involvement. Needless to say the variety of displays, sea creatures and sea mammals is awe inspiring. The staff is plentiful, helpful and knowledgeable. As with any destination spot like the MBA it does get crowded, very crowded so some of those shows and films get packed.There was a noticeable drop off in the crowd sizes as the late morning and early afternoon throngs hit the exits in droves around 4. That was the perfect opportunity to hit the touching pools and watch some animal feedings. We did get our hands stamped and stepped out to a local market and had an impromptu picnic by the water and went back for round two. That was later in the day and as noted above really allowed us to scoot around and see so much more without people blocking each display. I love to experience places like this with my daughter, it is without a doubt the things life long memories are built upon. We both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and I would hesitate to return. It isn't just for families or kids there were plenty of kid-less couples enjoying the venue too. A nice date spot and plenty of adjacent bars and restaurants to hit up after a day at the Aquarium can be found on Cannery Row."
72,2019-06-23,5,One of the pretties aquariums I've been to. It's a little pricey with general admission being $50. However it is a huge place and it's worth it. If you love sea creatures especially jellyfish then this is a must see place in Monterrey. I came in on a cloudy / sprinkling Saturday  so it was a little crowded. I think it's better to come during the weekday. Overall though I had an amazing time and got to see their huge jellyfish exhibit. I got some really cool shots of the fishes and sea creatures. I would love to come back.
73,2019-04-12,4,"Lots and lots and lots of marine life to see! In addition to the marine life, you can also walk out to their large balcony which lets you see some nice ocean views. Price was kind of steep. It was $40 each with student ID but I'm glad it's going to a good cause because they are a nonprofit organization that uses the funds to rehabilitate marine life. I watched their otter showing and they rescue otters that are orphaned or injured, rehabilitate them, teach them, and then release them back into the ocean but still closely monitor them! Love that!For my boyfriend and I, it took us about 1.5 hours to walk the entire thing but it may take you longer if you want to look at the fish longer. There were a TON of kids from school field trips that Monday we went so it was a bit hectic and I felt that I was kind of fighting my way to the tank viewing openings with a bunch of kids. I did not enjoy that part. I wish they'd have separate days where they close the aquarium for field trips because when I go to aquariums, I typically want to feel serene while looking at the fish glide in the water but that was not the case. Kind of disappointed in that area since my boyfriend and solely made the trip out here for the aquarium from LA (5-6 hours away)."
74,2020-02-01,5,"Gorgeous. Friendly. And very informative. Spent a good amount of fours hours walking about seeing each section of the aquarium. Breathtaking to see all the  creatures that lie in the depths. I adored my time there, especially the pond where you can touch the stingrays. Those sea pancakes are completely adorable and so entertaining to watch. Definitely recommend for a day packed with fun and education. It gots it all."
75,2019-12-31,5,"I don't think there is any review needed for this place. I grew up in the Bay Area and this was always a trip we begged to take. As I've gotten older and seen more Aquariums, it's amazing how spoiled we were. This place is the best. I brought my boyfriend from out of state here for the first time, and he was like a kid in a candy store running around looking at everything. They literally have every type of sea creature you can think of, which is rare. My suggestion is go early in the morning so you miss the crowds, and buy online if possible to miss the line. All ages will love it here."
76,2019-04-22,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of my family favorite places to visit in the Bay Area. This is a place of wonder for a child of any age. I've been taking my son here since he was just a few months old. Even at 7 yrs old it's always like his first time again. I also came here as a child. I still really enjoy the visit as an adult. The exhibits are small but full of beauty. Our favorite exhibits are the penguins and the sea otters. Of course the deep sea exhit where you can see a variety of unusual and magical jelly fish. I love coming here and will continue to visit. It can get crowded, be patient.You can bring a lunch and snacks altough the restaurant isn't too bad.It is pricey but worth all the memories. The entrance fee goes back to the exhibits.We park at San Carlos Beach and walk down to Cannery Row. You can also take the free Jazz trolley. Thank you MBA for all the memories."
77,2019-03-09,5,"I love aquariums and I really enjoyed my experience here. A piece of advice, make sure to buy your tickets online ahead of time and line up right when it opens. You can easily spend up to 3-4 hours here. By the time we left, there were LONG lines outside for the admission booth as well as the entrance line.When you arrive at the aquarium, I recommend grabbing a map because you'll want to plan out which exhibits you want to check out. I highly recommend the sea otter feeding as well as the open sea feeding. The sea otters are so cute! For any feeding show, always show up 30 min early because it will be crowded.This place is HUGE and pretty spacious. You can start anywhere and end up anywhere. The food here can be pretty expensive, so I recommend you either bring your own snacks or eat somewhere else. Other than that, this is a great place for the young ones as well as for just a date idea. If you're in the Monterey area, I recommend checking this place out."
78,2020-01-19,5,"Visited the bay area for the first time ever (I'm from SoCal) and decided to come to this aquarium on our last day of our 5 day trip. I just have to say it was so worth the $50 because there was a lot to see, and because it is a nonprofit aquarium the money goes directly to the marine life here. This is a great place to stop by and spend a few hours. Wish I could come back soon!!"
79,2019-06-03,5,"This Aquarium is unbelievable. If you are in the area, this is a must! I was lucky enough to have a family friend (who is also an Aquarium Docent) give us an amazing tour. This aquarium is laid out so effortlessly that the tanks have 360 degree views almost 100% of the time. I don't know how they do it! The sea otters are a real treat- they are playful, happy and attentive. You can tell how well they are cared for!The views of the ocean are hard to beat as well. This really was an amazing sight to see. I recommend arriving early, as a line does form outside, but it did move quick. The large tank wall is mesmerizing. So take it all in!"
80,2020-01-19,4,"I have been coming here for the last 15 years. Exceptional aquarium with sea creatures that you can not see anywhere else in the world. They have a huge tank of sharks, turtle, and fish. The moon jelly and sea nettle are so wonderful. The seahorses, nautalis, and kettle fish are awe inspiring. As of January 2020 price of adult admission is ~$49, way too much. The AAA discount is no longer available. The staff that work here are so nice."
81,2019-03-05,3,"I really liked the aquarium. I loved the open sea exhibit. It had two floors of seating that you can just sit and stare. It was a very calming exhibit and felt like I was in the deep blue ocean.But I can't see myself coming here all the time. It is so expensive. It's really worth it if you a family of four and get the family membership. Then I can see myself coming more often but with the membership it pays for itself after 2-3 visits. I expected it to be super crowded on a Saturday and it was. We waited in line exactly at when it opened. The first hour wasn't so bad, it was semi empty but as noontime rolled around it was busy. I purposely didn't bring the stroller because of the crowds and I'm glad I didn't.  The cafe was very nice but pretty pricey as expected. We ate around 2pm thinking it wouldn't beat the lunch rush but nope it was crowded and a struggle to find some seats. Im glad we went at least once because so many people recommended this aquarium to us. But not sure when the next time i will be back. Its not worth the 1.5 hour drive for us. I think when the kids are a bit older I'll splurge for the family membership but right now we are okay."
82,2020-02-15,5,How can you not go?? Became a member as soon as I moved into town and haven't looked back. Every exhibit is great.
83,2019-09-22,5,"Just keep visiting, just keep visiting..........Definitely a contender for one of the best aquariums around. Beautiful location, phenomenal sea life to see, so brilliantly set up and such a special treat, both fun and educational, for adults and kids alike. The folk, both staff and the volunteers, working there are extremely friendly and so helpful bar one or two individuals in the cafeteria but more on that below.If pushed, the only snag I'd say is the sometimes astonishingly questionable antics and service in the cafeteria. Otherwise, every other staff member and volunteer is always so phenomenal.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is most certainly a truly amazing place!"
84,2020-02-16,5,"Gets pretty crowded, but I love coming here. So much fun to see all the wildlife and the scenery. Jellyfish and sunfish are my favorite. Love watching them."
85,2020-01-11,5,I never been to Monterey before. First time to the area. It was so amazing. Very clean. Very very big. So much to see took about a thousand pics. There were a lot of people who don't control their kids. That deter us from being a big kid ourselves. We learned a lot about marine life. Do you know sand dollars are fuzzy and move fairly quickly. In nature we find the skeleton part the sand dollar.
86,2020-02-18,5,Who doesn't love a crisp Monterey afternoon on the main observation deck of the aquarium? This is a bucket list destination!
87,2019-10-05,5,"Probably the best aquarium I've ever been to. The kelp forests, sea otter display, and tentacle exhibitions were my favorites.Plenty of cool stuff for both adults and kids.My girlfriend and I had been looking forward to a visit for about a year and it certainly didn't disappoint. You can easily spend 3+ hours here."
88,2019-10-04,5,"Holy habalu I get the privilege of writing a once in the privilege of the place. Here's some fun facts about the aquarium: 1. There's an ultra electrostatic force field surrounding the place that stops you from frowning or even having a single worry 2. It takes me 3 hard working hours to see every exhibit 3. It's centrally located to Cannery row 4. They have a free movie theatre inside which helps when you get tired of walking 5. Year memberships are dirt cheap 6. Jellyfish Please if you have any sense of fun go to this place, support the fishies"
89,2019-12-21,5,"Enjoyed all the exhibits. My favorites were the jellies, sea otters, and penguins. The layout is very friendly and not cramped. I like how there are lots of kid friendly areas and exhibits."
90,2020-01-20,5,This was my first time coming out to the aquarium after hearing much about it and it did not disappoint. My kids really enjoyed the different animal habitats that they had displayed. there was interactive learning areas for kids and other educational activities. They have a in/out privilege which is good because the restaurant inside is expensive and not that good. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well as knowledgeable. My family really enjoyed it and we will definitely be coming back.
91,2020-02-10,5,Wonderful day exploring and enjoying beautiful educational exhibits. I highly recommend weekdays as it's empty!
92,2019-09-03,5,"Loved our visit to the aquarium. I actually did not want to go. These are the types of venues we visited when we had young kids. So I thought I would fond it boring. I was so wrong! Whole different experience to go when the kids are grown and you just experience it as a middle aged couple. I loved the docents and the hours we spent here exploring the exhibits. My favorites were the jelly fish. So many colors and the background music made it look like they were dancing to the music. It was so incredibly beautiful! The crustacean exhibit was another favorite. There are lots of hands on experiences for the kiddos, and we enjoyed seeing all the kids there enjoying, exploring and learning. I went there grudgingly and left enthralled!"
93,2019-08-23,5,I wanted to hear sigorni weaver's voice like finding dory haha. This place is so great and so well done. My favorite was the school of fish swimming with the turtle. It's so amazing to see fish swim in a massive school. The otters of course are beyond cute and playful and know how to bring the crowds. I felt sad for the penguins who looked bored as hell and cramped in their tiny space. Jellyfish are also a showstopper. They have all day parking several blocks away and not too far from the aquarium. If you're a AAA member you can get discounts on your tickets and purchase online to beat the line.
94,2019-01-13,5,"This is probably one of the best aquariums that I have visited. There are many things to see while you're here, you probably could spend the entire day here! I truly loved the large tanks, multiple exhibits, cool exhibits for kids to play & learn and the beautiful scenic views. Truly a memorable and fun day at the aquarium! After a visit to the aquarium, there's much to see on Cannery Road. I'm a huge fan of the aquarium and I can't wait to return for another visit!"
95,2019-01-04,4,"I love Aquariums and this one is phenomenal. The views, the outdoor patio, the ocean water fountain, and the overall flow of the museum was wonderfully created and curated. They had so many different types of animals and fish -- just look at the pics! The jellyfish were most exciting to me -- there is a lobed one that looks like it has a electric rainbow lights. Mind blowing to think we share the planet w/ thee amazing animals! There are no dolphins here, I look forward to seeing them so was disappointed that they don't have them but obviously there was incredible octopus, kelp forest, tiger sharks, sting rays etc. There is also a cafe inside - which i didn't eat at but seemed overpriced. There are several gift shops located throughout the exhibits which is great marketing on their partPerhaps if I was a child or if I had a kid of my own I could appreciate this more because for $50 per adult and $40 for student this spot is sorta expensive in my opinion. If you have AAA card you can get $5 off by ordering tkts thru the phone.  The aquarium is VERY KID friendly and lots of activities so very worth it if you can entertain your kid for a day w/ this."
96,2019-08-01,3,"I've been to more aquariums than I can count, or care to. This is definitely one of the more crowded ones, even for a Thursday. I dare to imagine what this place looks like on the weekend. For the size of it, there aren't as many exhibits as you would expect. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot but, in my opinion, they don't make the best use of space. Bathrooms were hard to find and I believe the ticket is overpriced for what this place is. There's some wow factor here but not enough for what I'm paying for entry."
97,2019-11-28,5,Nice aquarium. Otter feedings three times a day. Penguins. Jelly fish. Large tanks for upstairs and downstairs viewing. Lovely gift shop. Good clam chowder in the cafe. Every kind of fish. Sea bird area. Touching stations for kids. Gets very crowded! Coming early is recommended. $50 for adult admission. Saw all exhibits in 1.5 hours walking through.
98,2020-02-09,5,Come here 2 times a year! Have a membership for a family of 4. Love Monterey. For what we pay a year is worth it. Our guest passes we use for our family and they love it.
99,2020-02-05,5,One of the best aquariums in the world. I've been a member for years. BEAUTIFUL. So so so so many beautiful exhibits and wonderfully cared for animals. Highly recommend.
100,2019-02-05,5,My husband and I had the best time visiting The Monterey Bay Aquarium! We paid $49.95 each for adult tickets and added $15 each for a private tour which was such a wonderful experience. We were there the whole morning and had a private tour which was really extensive. We even got to go to the lab and were educated by a knowledgeable instructor and met with the lab team! So worth $15 extra! The highlight for me would be the sea otters! They were super adorable! We stepped out to lunch and came back to walk around some more. This place is insanely huge so you would need a day to really explore.
101,2018-12-11,5,"We had a couple guest passes so we wanted to use them on our trip in NorCal.  I've heard so many things about the aquarium and I was so excited to finally so for myself what it's like.  We weren't disappointed!My favorite exhibits were the jellyfish and the kelp forest.  You could probably stand for a long time just looking at all the creatures in there.  I also really liked the sea otters and the aviaries.  They were so active when we were looking at them!There is a lot of educational information throughout the entire place.  Each animal has a few facts about itself posted next to it.  There is an auditorium where you can learn more about specific aspects of the ocean, with the shows going on every half hour.  You can also find a few interactive models that will educate you on what to do/what not to do in order to preserve the wildlife and the ocean, including reducing waste and the damage that trash, especially plastic, can do to the environment.  They also have a section where you can pet some bat rays and sea cucumbers.  We got lucky and found street parking for 4 hours max and were able to look around the entire aquarium within about 3 hours.  Of course, there's a ton of people on the weekend afternoon so there's huge crowds in and around the aquarium.  There were a bunch of kids running around and cutting in front of you so it can get a bit hard to get a good look at some of the animals unless you're patient and wait a long time for the kids to move out of the way.  If you want to avoid the crowd, then it might be best to go on a weekday morning, other than at peak dates of the year.  The Aquarium has pretty much everything that a popular, public museum needs: educational features, interactive models, and of course the animals.  You can really tell that the people working here are very passionate with what they do and they are always eager to inform anyone with questions about the animals there.  I really learned a lot from coming here and I would love to come back for more!"
102,2018-12-24,3,"My wife and I went for a weekend getaway and decided to check out the aquarium. I have to first say that I wasn't expecting it to be so pricey. It's actually a bit ridiculous. They do have plenty to see and our favorites were the otters. They're quite funny to watch. They also had a great display of jelly fish. I did enjoy everything I saw, but that price..."
103,2019-01-04,4,"Having moved out of the area, I haven't been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in years, so this was a total treat for me as well as my 4 year old nephew. This place is perfect for people of all ages. If I was by myself, I would have spent more time at the exhibits and presentations. However, as I was with my nephew, we spent most of our time in the play areas (and there are quite a few). In total, we were there for 4 1/2 hours including a short break for lunch, which is actually a long time for 4 year old's attention span. My only issue is that the viewing for the otter feeding was extremely crowded (on a supposedly not so crowded day) and everyone stood at the windows, which really makes it hard for a 4 year old to see. I had to lift him up for a bit, and people were generally not very considerate. There has to be a better way to organize so that children can actually see the feeding.The penguin and fish feedings were much better as they had the children sit on the ground, but not sure if there would be an ability to do that in the otter area given the space. The feedings are especially fun and educational."
104,2019-08-31,5,"I really fell in love with this aquarium. The location is right on the ocean with gorgeous views of Santa Cruz and the bay. The customer service was impeccable! Every associate went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. They housed a variety of sea life that we've never seen before or even knew existed. The kids area is so interactive. They have a restaurant that is a kind of choose your plate cafeteria style and it's pretty darn good! We were there from open until they were locking up :-). Hand down, awesome experience!"
105,2019-11-09,4,"Had our IESALC conference banquet here. Very nice aquarium, great view of bay at night. Major issues are: 1) we didn't get to see whole facility during banquet, and 2) food wasn't that great.Would like to go back when the whole place is open."
106,2019-07-17,5,"It's always a joy to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  My wife loves otters so watching the otters get fed is worth the price of admission (why do they like ice so much?  We need to research that!).  Also, go to the first feeding - they get full and sleepy after the other feedings. Main tank feed with the sharks had the sharks a little finicky about the food so I'm not sure that's worth the crowds.The Tentacles and Baja exhibits were a nice change to the rest of the aquarium.My quick tip - become a member!  Basic math - for the price of two admissions, you become a member for multiple visits for the year - expedited access (although normal access was great) and it's tax deductible."
107,2019-06-17,4,"During our recent trip to the Pacific Coast, while visiting Carmel and Monterey, we went to the Monterey Aquarium. The facility location is perfectly situated right on Monterey Bay, surrounded by blocks of interesting buildings, shops and restaurants. Public Parking Garages are located nearby within walking distance. We also Yelped for our breakfast and lunch locations. Lunch was especially great and conveniently located right next to the garage where we parked. Lunch is also available in the museum.At the Ticket Counter, a Staff Member gave us a map which listed all the showtimes. Be sure to get to them in advance because there is limited seating and mostly just standing room.When we arrived one of the staff was showing everyone a big jar of Baby Jellyfish. They were really tiny.We enjoyed the different exhibits. Our favorite was the Kelp Forest located on two floors. On the top level of the Kelp Forest is a hands on counter where adults and children can touch what's in the tanks. We also loved seeing the Sea Otters and Penguins Exhibits. One area was for Nesting Penguins. We watched one that was nesting for a while. Others were climbing the rocks, swimming or catching fish.We thought this was a beautiful aquarium. It was smaller in comparison to others we have been to but nicely laid out. If you get your hand stamped, you can even leave to have lunch and then return for more fun."
108,2019-01-11,5,"Our final stop in Monterey was the Monterey Bay Aquarium of course!  I have been to several aquariums, Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, Maui Ocean Center on Maui, San Francisco Bay Aquarium, Birch Aquarium in La Jolla, etc. but nothing beats this place.  Taking lots of pictures, I made my way through the aquarium and all of it's exhibits. My favorite by far is the Jelly exhibit.  They also have an outside area where you might even be able to spot a whale or a couple of otters holding hands!Parking is a pain, but that is the norm in Monterey, so be prepared. I suggest getting here early before the crowd really starts to roll in."
109,2020-02-09,5,Family friendly with lots to see! So many different animals and a couple different touch pools. Lots for little ones to do andBeautiful views as well when you walked out the back of the aquarium! Love the conservation efforts keeping the area beautiful. Highly recommend checking it out if you're visiting Monterey!
110,2018-11-14,5,"Allen and I came here to celebrate our 4 year dating anniversary! Odd choice, right? LOL.Pro tip 1: get here right when they open! This way you can find street parking. However, if you don't get one of those, I recommend parking at the Cannery Parking Garage (a 5 min walk away), since it's safe and pretty cheap. ($15/whole day, but goes down depending on time of day)Pro tip 2: bring a student ID! You get a small discount when you purchase the ticket.Pro tip 3: look at the list of feeding/shows, and plan what you want to see! Some of the more exciting ones happen only once, or some of them overlap. Pro tip 4: they allow re-entry (for same day tickets of course)! All you do is get a stamp by the exit, and then show the stamp under the blue light when you re-enter. Yay for good food!Surprisingly, we spent an entire day here, and were pretty tired from running all over the place. The aquarium isn't super big, but there is a lot to see! I recommend seeing:+1 live feeding :: the huge tank filled with all the fish and sharks (?)! This only happens once at 11 am, and gets crowded pretty quickly if you don't plant yourself down beforehand. +1 jelly fish :: I forget the name of this, but the whole section dedicated to jelly fish was really cool! Never knew there were so many types. +1 the documentaries :: the theatre room was a nice place to rest our feet, and to sit down and learn about what efforts Monterey is putting into restoring the oceans and saving the animals. Overall, had a pretty fun time! I can imagine kiddos loving this place. If the weather allows, definitely step outside to the back of the aquarium to sit and enjoy the ocean view! A bit pricey of the entrance fee, but something worth seeing at least once. After that, head out to the pier and check out the boutiques and shops!"
111,2019-08-08,5,"Awesome aquarium.There are tons of things that are cool for adults and for kids.  Lots of interactive stuff for kids, plus touching pool with starfish and such.Very cool jellyfish exhibit, one of my favorites.  The large tanks with the large fish and sharks were also very cool.  I could stay in all of those areas for a long time just watching the fish.The sea otters are really cool and you can also see sea otters out in the wild in the ocean nearby.I'm not going to go on and on b/c there are probably thousands of reviews already.$50 to enter, in and out privileges.  You can find free street parking 3-4 blocks away (pro tip!) but make sure to read the signs.5 stars."
112,2019-06-24,4,"The aquarium is a cool experience and I recommend it if you don't mind dropping $300 for a family of six, plus another $100-200 in the gift shop on your way out. We only go when we have free passes. I'm cheap like that. I grew up here and I have been to the aquarium probably 40 times, so forgive me if I can't bring myself to fork out. If you really want a true Monterey Bay experience do these three things: 1) Go paddle boarding or kayaking at Lovers Point. We hung out with dolphins last time we did this!2) Go tide pooling at Asilomar (or lovers). You'll see hundreds of hermit crabs, sea anemones and sea stars (don't call them starfish).3) Ride bikes to the coast guard pier... all the way to the end. There you will be just feet away from tons of sea lions of every shape and size. I hope you hop out of the Monterey Bay industrial complex and treat yourself to a little local flave from yours truly. After visiting home the North Carolina beaches (although beautiful) are just so boring. There's nothing to ""see"" like the list above. #transplantproblems"
113,2020-02-06,5,A must see when you come to Monterey.  My favorite is the penguins.  I have a salt water fish tank so I appreciate all of the work this takes.
114,2019-07-25,5,"The MB Aquarium is actually a bigger entity than just the Aquarium itself and they do some very good things for the animals and environment. The Aquarium itself is actually much physically smaller than you might imagine, based on the world recognition it has garnered, but it is a world class facility with some great exhibits and educational learnings. Due to the popularity, Parking can be a real PITA, but either stick to your guns to find cheaper parking or just cough it up for $30 options and get parked quicker on busier days. If you live locally and you'd go often enough, a annual pass is the more economical option."
115,2018-12-03,5,"You haven't really gone back home until you take a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I not only enjoy the nostalgia of a trip to the aquarium, but the fact that animal behavior can be different each time. Some days the octopi are our and playing and some days they are hidden. Sometimes the cuddle fish are cuddling. Beyond that the feeding times are always a treat as you enjoy watching fish be excited about food, and have quippy speakers narrate the action in the exhibit.Another great activity is the bat ray touch pool. It may look scary but these gentle creatures are velvety to the touch. Just make sure to roll up your sleeves first. While you're there, take some time at the touch pools and ask the docents about the decorating crabs and abalone. They always have new and fun facts. As for parking, if you don't mind a walk, I usually park along Ocean View so I don't have to pay for parking. It offers a nice walkway and usually there are som seals lying on the beach to wave to on the way to the Aquarium."
116,2019-08-11,5,"Just happened to be in town when the Aquarium stays open a bit later, has a live band and hosts food and drinks! Lucky me!!It was a beautiful evening spent with creatures big and small."
117,2019-11-06,5,"I got a student membership while visitng Monterey. I went to the aquarium probably 9 times in 3 days. I couldn't get enough. The staff is so friendly and informative. The environments are set up so stunningly and in a way that facilitates learning. It was so nice to watch staff teach children about various animals, especially those they could interact with."
118,2019-04-14,5,"This is one of the best aquariums I've visited. Of course the jellyfish were the stars here but everything was great. I really like the educational focus of us protecting the creatures and plants that live in the water, we really do have a responsibility to keep them safe and their environment clean. Everyone of every age will have a great time here. The cafe food was good  it was nice to see healthy options too. You could easily spend the day here. You need to use one of the parking garages in the area as parking is scarce and they don't have their own lot. Adult price was $50 but was well worth it. If you're in the area it's a must do"
119,2019-07-02,4,"I have been to this aquarium three times now and it never gets old for me, but this week I had a whole new experience-Evenings by the Bay. The aquarium was opened from 6pm to 8pm. There was live music and a range of food from turkey legs to caramel popcorn. There regular cafe was closed so if you wanted to snack there you could purchase a ticket for the food that was served from tables in the lobby. They were also selling wine for guests to sip on while viewing the exhibits that were open for the afternoon hours."
120,2019-11-21,5,I love this place - such a treat. It is expensive but I guess for the quality and atmosphere it takes a lot of $$$ to fees those animals.  My advice - go early and enjoy it - take a break and eat at a local restaurant for lunch and then go back for the afternoon feedings and programming.  The tanks are so amazing and exhibits are very informative.  Can't wait to go back next time with the kids
121,2019-11-25,5,Love this aquarium! I love that it's good for adults and kids - has great kids areas  and animal feeding/interactions. We live far away but try to come to the aquarium at least once a year.
122,2019-11-30,5,"Always feeling guilty for not visiting this wonderful icon of ocean conservation. In spite of my inability to get around on foot, I found the Aquarium just as interesting as any previous visit over the past thirty years I have been visiting the Aquarium. The mostly volunteer staff are the polite and friendly and I would pay any price for entrance to the MBA."
123,2018-10-20,3,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and boyyy it was packed. Lots of youngsters and families scattered about. Be prepared to see crowding at the tanks and exhibit areas. Strollers and parents with big bags and backpacks bumping into you. Some peeps inconsiderate of personal space, others walking into your photos or taking forever and a day to take a photo or video capture.Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours here. You need to get your money's worth here if you're dropping $50 per ticket. My friend and parentals took our time going from each exhibit. I spend about 4 hours walking around and exploring every inch of the aquarium. Must-see(s) are the sea turtle, penguins, jellyfish and the anchovies swimming around in circles making you think you're hallucinating or in a trance. Foodwise/hungerwise..if you're famished or parched from walking through the exhibits they do have a cafeteria, however everything is overpriced..but you prolly knew that already. I suggest bringing snacks and a water bottle to fill up at their water fountain to save some $$$. Parking wise..It can be a bit challenging. Mainly metered street parking, no parking garages close by. However, you can park at a garage about 10-15 min away for a flat rate of $7 at the Downtown East Garage and take the shuttle to the Aquarium. It'll also stop along the wharf, downtown and Cannery Row (check the aquarium website for more deets). Overall, the aquarium was 'aight', it's catered more to the lil youngsters and marine enthusiast. I recommend going during a weekday and early so you don't have to deal with the crowds. It's nice to check out at least once."
124,2019-07-26,5,"Great place with so much to see. It is pricey but you can get student discounts!I wish the tidal pool had those sea anemones things that stick to your fingers, but it's still pretty cool. My favorite was probably the bat rays that you could touch if they came up close."
125,2019-04-06,5,Great family place.  An absolutely fantastic place to have fun and learn about our oceans and the really cool things that live in it.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Just beware that this place does get full.
126,2019-04-01,3,"There are thousands of incredible marine specimens on display.  Somehow for every fish, there is a screaming toddler.  If you're coming with kids, just go and take two advil before.  If you're going without kids, bring earplugs and try to aim for a weekday afternoon at about 2:00pm (after field trips leave).  Seriously some amazing displays though."
127,2018-09-17,4,"In my 25 years of life, I just visited Monterey for the first time on labor day weekend! I really wanted to check out the Aquarium, so we spent the whole day there. If you don't purchase your tickets in advance, you must wait in a line that wraps around the building in order to buy them. It goes by pretty quick, so nothing to worry about. Adult tickets are $49 and student is $39. There are a variety of exhibits. My personal favorite was the deep sea. Here you can find the jelly fish notorious for being photographed. But so many different species of sea creatures are here for preservation and study. We were able to sit in the auditorium for the deep sea video and narration. This was the most entertaining part of our visit. While you're waiting for folks to trickle in, there is an interactive quiz that shows on the screen. Then the production goes for about 15-20 minutes...It gets way too crowded for my taste because it's a super educational place to bring your children. I like that there is reentry. You can literally spend your entire day here, but having the privilege for ins and outs to explore cannery row during lunch...or just to take a break from the crowded-ness inside is nice."
128,2019-11-11,4,"My two daughters, Granddaughter, and myself went to the Monterey Aquarium after visiting the Vision Quest Band B, or also called the Monterey Zoo the day before.  We were lucky enough to get tickets from my cousin, they are $ 50.00 for Adults, I believe $10 less for Seniors.  It was very crowded, but we expected it since it was a Sunday.     We saw many beautiful areas, loved the large tanks showing the kelp from the floored going toward the top of the water.  Saw sharks and so many species of fish.     It did get confusing for us to find certain displays because there are different floors and each floor had had many areas to go turn into.  The attraction that we liked the most was the otters. It showed a male dropping pebbles next to his pregnant mate. The pebbles are brought to the females so they can make a nest.   The one display we were disappointed was the otters.  There were so many people in front of the windows you had a very hard time seeing any of them.  They really should have made that display with tall windows and maybe different levels so people could see over each other.  There were a lot of kids and strollers and we were a little overwhelmed.  We wouldn't go back and pay that the price. It was nice to see but we live six hours away and it was enough for us to remember for the future."
129,2019-10-20,4,"Have not been here in years, so we had to take our daughter to the Aquarium while we were in town for a wedding. We had a code to get a discount on tickets which helped. So much fun and still so beautiful. Our daughter and her cousins were running around looking and touching everything; they did not want to leave. We went on a Thursday, so it was not  really crowded and were not fighting with people to get through to see. My only complaint would be their food in the cafe. The food was not very good and  it was completely overpriced. Our favorite sections of the Aquarium were the jelly fish, penguins and the huge tanks. I loved how I was approached by so many workers too, who asked if I had any questions and they would just educate me and provide so much information, you can tell how much they live their job! It definitely was a bit expensive to get it, but it was worth it."
130,2019-03-15,5,"Very expensive but it all goes to a good cause.Cheryl and her daughter just loved it all.""FISHIES FISHIES"" she cried out so many times.The deep ocean exhibit seemed to intrigue her the mostBut the bird area was where she stayed the longest.Two hours went by so fast it seemed like minutes.Lots of rude teenagers there this friday but they could not compete with our stroller when we rolled over them continously."
131,2019-03-19,5,"As a Northern Coast California kid, I've been coming to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for as long as I can remember. It has and always have a special place in my heart for teaching 8 year old Hannah about the importance of ocean conservation and reminding 24 year old Hannah of that importance. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a true gem to our amazing coast. Between the amazing programs, the pristine aquarium, their conservation efforts, and family friendly atmosphere it can't be beat. I dream of the day I'm able to take my own family here. The aquarium is the gem of Monterey and I hope it forever remains that way. You just can't beat the open ocean exhibit, but none of the other exhibits are worth missing either. I really can't say much more about it than it is absolutely worth visiting and you can't compare it to any other aquarium experience."
132,2019-05-28,5,"The sights you'll see are jaw-droppingly beautiful. The penguin feeding made me light up like a child again. The otters were to-die-for cute. It's easy to forget how much life there is underwater. The Monterey Bay Aquarium really puts it in perspective. Definitely visit the deep sea exhibit and octopus wing. If you wait long enough at the cuddle fish exhibit, you'll see it devour a tiny shrimp in a totally wicked way. I can't believe how knowledgeable the volunteers are, too. How do they have so many? Overall, this is a great spot for a budding relationship or sprouting family. Even the food isn't bad. It's also cool to see that even their food court doesn't carry any products in plastic -- glass and aluminum only. They could stand to use less guilt tactics when it comes to trying to get people not to litter."
133,2019-10-31,5,What a wonderful place to visit! It is so well done. The huge kelp tank is amazing and so fun to watch at their feeding times. Who could love anything more than watching the otters swimming and playing with each other? There is nothing more beautiful than the various jellyfish floating by. You could watch these spectacles forever. Great visit for people of all ages. Every child should get to go there every few years as their appreciation develops.
134,2020-02-15,4,Awesome for children and beautiful outdoor scenery. We had a nice trip but it was very very crowded.
135,2019-05-30,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must-do, must-see aquarium. As we were leaving the San Jose area we wanted to stop in Monterey and Carmel before returning to Los Angeles. We went on Memorial Day and although we expected crowds the experience was bittersweet. There were a lot of people, strollers, and no way to really control the crowds.  This wasn't our private tour of the aquarium so we definitely made the best of it. For the admission fee of $50, the experience was less than ideal but we still enjoyed it as best as we could. I'll blame the crowds on the holiday. We were a part of that crowd to someone else so it's all relative. Speaking of relative, it was relatively expensive, but also worth it. There is an endless supply of marine life to entertain, educate, and engage your senses.  The design allows you to see all types of sea life. The indoor and outdoor harbor gave you fresh air and perspective on how large the ocean is in this large facility. The focus of this aquarium is about marine conservation and the rich biodiversity of the Monterey Bay. They do an excellent job of presenting the habitat of the bay with exhibits that include the giant kelp forest, sea otters, small schooling fish, jellyfish, larger predators including sharks, penguins, and even sea turtles.. Feedings occur throughout the day and a map of the aquarium with a schedule on the reverse side is provided as well.All of the employees that we encountered were great at giving information and service. They may not have known all of the questions that I asked about the animals but they still made efforts to assist us while we were there. There are petting areas for certain animals e.g crabs, manta rays, urchins, and abalones' and all of the workers at the stations made those experiences fun and enjoyable.  There are many interactive exhibits that engage youth and adults alike. Each area was uniquely designed, informative, and immersive. We liked seeing the penguins in their little habitat and seeing all of the fish in the large aquarium of the kelp forest was fascinating, especially when the diver told us about each fish while he was feeding them.  The decor and environment generate and stimulate curiosity and imagination.  The area around Monterey is incredible and worth the drive. It's a beautiful area the aquarium is an added attraction to the community. If I do it again, I'd make sure to purchase tickets in advance to avoid the lines and save paper. I would also purchase through AAA to receive a a discount. I would also advise you to make sure to look at the schedule for feeding times on the map provided. It will make your experience better."
136,2019-04-30,5,An awesome weekend will be had when you visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium! Lots of daily shows to fill into your schedule between the touch pool and learnings around the exhibits. Don't forget to set out 15-20 minutes just to chill out in front of the kelp Forest or deep ocean and just watch the aquanimals do their thing.
137,2018-08-30,4,"Welcome to the Cetacean Institute! Or for non Star Trek fans, the Monterey Bay Aquarium. This world class aquarium occupies a former fish cannery along Cannery Row in Monterey. There is little onsite parking, so choose one of the surrounding lots or hope for street parking. You will spend a lot of time here so get a space with lots of hours. The aquarium is massive with many exhibits for both kids and adults. First timers may be overwhelmed by the size. Most of the exhibits focus on the surrounding ocean and California waterways. They have a popular jellyfish area and a nice combination of indoor and outdoor exhibits. Kids will love the touch tanks and interactive exhibits. Adults may appreciate the constant reminders about pollution and sustainable seafood choices. Throughout the day, they have several feedings of the animals including penguins and otters. I recommend timing your visit to see at least one while moving about. You can also observe humans eating at the food court and restaurant. Of course there are several gift shops to help you spend your money. Speaking of money, this place is super expensive. Granted, running a sustainable aquarium requires a lot of expensive seafood for the animals. Admission is $50 which is really too much these days for most families. Plus, it's harder and harder to justify caging animals for our pleasure especially when HD video allows their observation in the wild. It's been a rite of passage to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. Just like Disneyland and Lake Tahoe, most families make the journey here at least once. It's also popular with tourists from around the world with lots of languages spoken inside. They lose a star for the price and hassle, but this is still one of the finest aquariums in the United States if not the world."
138,2020-01-19,5,Awesome aquarium that's located in Monterey! It's pretty big and has really nicely maintained tanks! There are many special live shows and some in the auditorium! I loved that they don't use any plastic in the cafe (no a straws or cups)
139,2019-11-06,5,"My first time. Spent the day there. Enjoyable and educational. Kids everywhere, but you're a kid, too, experiencing the diversity and beauty of sea life. Exhibits are thoughtfully put together, docents are extremely helpful and informative. We are a senior couple, no children with us, but could see how this could be a truly enriching - and fun - exhibit for the young set. Fun and educational - a wonderment. Saw all of the exhibits, but didn't have time for the tours. Will have to do that next time."
140,2020-02-20,5,"I've been here many times and most recently went last week. I have a great time every time I go and makes for a great day trip. I suggest going through the week so that children are in school because it can be hectic with children running around. If you plan on going more than twice a year, definitely get a yearly pass because it comes with discounts."
141,2019-03-22,5,"We love the Aquarium and visit about every other year, sometimes more when out of town guests come to visit.I'm going to get this out of the way first, since I've seen this concern mentioned by several others, which is the price. Yes, admission is expensive; as of this writing, $49.95 for adults and $20.95 for children. However, keep in mind the money not only goes to care and upkeep of the animals, but also research, education and preservation. The space itself is vast and open, with some very tall, deep exhibits that aim to recreate the natural environment as much as possible. The Deep Ocean and Kelp Forrest are very impressive. I personally love the jelly fish, and walking through this exhibit, watching as they graceful move through the water is so peaceful. On the more lively end of things are the otters, which is a justifiably popular exhibit. They are playful and active and never disappoint. The children area is a lot of fun for the kiddos, and the ""hands on"" exhibits as always an adventure. Being under the ocean wave is always a big hit. I also love all of the vista points that offer expansive views of the bay. Outside of the aquarium you'll find stairs down to a small strip of beach. Not a lay out in the sun beach, but a dig in the sand beach, which  kids always enjoy. A day at the aquarium is time well spent, so save up and plan to spend several hours so you can see everything."
142,2018-09-17,5,"The difficulty in reviewing the Monterey Bay Aquarium is that nothing, I mean nothing, isn't amazing about the experience! From the sea creatures within, to the highly helpful staff in attendance, like Zach...who stood with us answering every question we had for a good 25 minutes ( and when he wasn't sure of the answer to a perticular question...calling a ""Naturalist"", Katie, who did know the answer), to the impeccable cleanliness of the facility...everything met our highest expectations. Value wise, we found this experience to be well worth the cost!A real WOW experience, the Monterey Bay Aquarium receives a ""highly recommend"" review!"
143,2019-02-24,4,Today was my first visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in about 8 years.  Our friends are members and took my husband and I and our two boys ( 1 1/2 and 4mo) and it was a lot of fun.  Our 1 year old really just wanted to run around and thankfully there is a lot of room to do so.  Their huge tanks are amazing to watch and so are the jellyfish!  They had a small interactive area with Puffin Birds in one corner that my son loved and we spent a lot of time there and thankfully it has an amazing view of the ocean to look at while keeping an eye on the kids.  It was also a beautiful day and we walked around outside too.  Even though we didn't pay to get in today I did notice the prices and they are definitely on the expensive side so be prepared to pay a lot to get in but it is a beautiful place to visit and see at least once.
144,2019-04-16,5,Absolutely amazing aquarium. People might think it's expensive but for the ecology and learning that happens here it is a small price to pay . The building is clean and well organized . It was busy. Volunteers and staff were all knowledgeable and friendly . We arrived at 9:40 and were let in though opening isn't until10am. I found easy street parking . However everything at 1:00 when we left was much busier . Anyhow my kids loved the experience . The only thing that was a challenge was the feeding events. Too crowded in too small of a space . We especially enjoyed the Sea exhibit and tentacles exhibit .
145,2018-08-07,4,"What happened to the seahorses?The first time I visited the aquarium was in March 2010 and I fell in love with the seahorses. Back then they had a whole section of special exhibition called The Secret Lives of Seahorses located on the first floor. It has now been replaced by Tentacles (focusing on octopuses, cuttlefishes and their families). Well, that was 8 years ago.This past weekend we came back for a second visit (first time for my teen). Most of the exhibits remained the same including the Kelp Forest (1st and 2nd floors), Penguins & Seabirds, The Open Sea and the Jellies on the second floor. I still enjoy the jelly fish exhibition. So fascinating watching these sea creatures dance in the water. The first floor still has the Sea Otters and the Auditorium and the two new exhibits: Tentacles and Viva Baja! Life on the Edge. There were some sea horses in this exhibit and also a more permanent exhibit devoted to seahorses in Splash Zone but not as much as they had before. When I asked one of the staff workers about the exhibit they told me that the rest of the seahorses found new homes in other accredited institutions. I miss the sea dragons and sea horses.The ticket prices are expensive but we were able to get discounted tickets through my work. Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the most beautiful aquariums I've visited. It is located at the ocean's edge on historic Cannery Row. Weekends are full of tourists! If you can, do visit during the weekdays where you can enjoy more of the sea creatures without the crowd.Review #1101"
146,2018-09-06,5,"My husband has an obsession with aquariums but I'm not really into them but as a birthday gift I surprised him with a trip to Monterey during our recent trip to SF for his birthday.  The drive down was super easy from San Francisco- under 2 hours and we got up really early to beat the rush hour traffic.  I'm not sure how much aquariums usually cost but the tickets were kind of expensive, however I was able to use my AAA membership which knocked off a$10 bucks so I was happy with that.  Parking was easy and we had no problem finding it. We  arrived at the aquarium as soon as the doors opened so it wasn't super busy at first but picked up. From the minute we walked in the staff was so polite. I was worried they wouldn't allow our backpacks in but we had no issues, including all our snacks and drinks lol. The staff was super cool!  Sorry guys but words can't describe how beautiful this place was. New, clean, huge, beautiful floors, walls...I could go on and on.  WE were overwhelmed with excitement like 5 year olds from the minute we walked it.  It was kind of confusing knowing where to start but I guess the staff noticed so a group of them walked over to help us.  I mentioned that I surprised my husband with this trip and they were super excited it was his birthday and made him wear a huge birthday button with his name on it- It was adorable! The staff and visitors wished him happy birthday as we walked around. Once we were on our way the building was easy to navigate and get around.  We watched a few feedings (otters and penguins). Get to the feedings early because there were soooo many people.  They do make everyone either sit or stand on the back wall so everyone could see so I thought that was very considerate of the staff.  We ended up being at the aquarium for about 4 hours even taking a break at the cafe which was fairly priced and had some great options. I can honestly say that I am now a fan of aquariums although Monterey Bay Aquarium has set the bar very high."
147,2019-12-02,5,"I've visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium now a few times and only have the best things to say about it. For a smaller aquarium, this place is stunning and provides a very thorough and in-depth view into the history of Monterey Bay and the local areas' ocean systems and inner workings. I  have gone during the end of the business, during the morning of the weekends, and more and have always had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend taking a behind the scenes tour and learning from their wonderful and well trained/passionate volunteers more about the wildlife that you will find in the oceans. They also have great programming throughout the year for kids, families, and even admission-free days for locals! If you've never been before, I would highly recommend at least taking the time to go through here once. The deep-sea portion is hands down my favorite part of the whole aquarium followed by the jellies. You won't be disappointed making the time to go visit here."
148,2019-10-17,5,"I had mixed emotions about whether or not to include this aquarium on our itinerary for our short stay in Pacific Grove, but am so happy that we did in fact visit it.  Had we had more flexibility, we could have spread our visit over 2 days at the same price since there is a special for those staying in local motels.  From entry to exit, we encountered one friendly and knowledgeable employee after another.  The exhibits were uniformly fantastic with our personal highlights being the feeding of the penguins plus the open sea feeding.  Having been active birders in the past for many years, we particularly pleased by the aviary.  Other highlights included the always entertaining otters, jellyfish and touch pools.  If hordes of school children bother you, an employee suggested returning after 2PM when most of them have departed.  LOL"
149,2019-02-21,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of those places you just have to love. Set in a beautiful and historic part of Monterey right on the water, it's truly awesome. We bought a family membership which has been a lifelong dream of mine, and finally got to drive down there and use it. I've always wanted to support them somehow. It's just a beautiful and mesmerizing tour once inside. All of the fish, crustaceans, penguins, otters, etc are so cool.I could stand at the large aquarium glass and stare for hours. Watching the shiny mackerel swim endlessly around in their swarm is my favorite. Well, one of my favorites: Finding all the jellyfish is a favorite also. Also a favorite - the otters, the penguins and there's a wave hallway where you can stand and a wave washes over you every few seconds. Calming. It's just a nice day when you visit. There's a million places around there to eat (or in the aquarium itself for that matter)."
150,2020-01-09,5,World class facility! All other aquariums that I have been to after this one have disappointed me in terms of presentation and information. The displays are gorgeous and there is written information to learn about every single animal they have. It is an absolute must see when visiting the area.
151,2018-07-24,4,"A very exciting aquarium to visit!!!The last time I came was over 20 years ago. It's been greatly enlarged since then. I would've given it five stars but I'm knocking off a star for the following reason:In a large crowd, it was very difficult to navigate the very large aquarium even with a map. Also, there were so few guides around to assist for directions. In addition, when the guides gave directions, they were confusing. The aquarium could consider directions on the walls too. On a brighter note: All the oceanography exhibits are colorful,breathtaking and fun!You see adorable sea otters floating on their backs, cute penguins, sharks, graceful jellyfish and much more!!!A large souvenir shop is available along with popup shops through out the facility.Should I come next time, I'll definitely get tickets through AAA beforehand. The adult admission is $49.95. Upon entrance, I asked if they took a AAA discount. They told me yes, but you have to get it through AAA first. The website does verify this info. In the future, I would come before or after the summertime to avoid the big crowds."
152,2019-03-22,5,I've gone to many aquariums across the country and none compares to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I dreamed of going there as a child and never got the opportunity but was able to bring my children instead and it was a wonderful experience.  Definitely glad I checked it off my bucket list and I look forward to returning!
153,2018-08-23,5,"I have been to Monterey Bay Aquarium a few times as a child and did not really remember much. However, as a college student, I had to come visit as a school project. I was really impressed how cool and interactive it was, even for people my age or older!Yes tickets are pricey. However, if you are a student like myself, they do offer student discounts. They also offer senior discounts and triple A discounts for tickets. The aquarium is huge! There are 2 floors with many exhibits. Many for young children but also many for any age. My favorite was the jellyfish room, it was so pretty and majestic!Parking is a little tricky. You may have to park on the street or have to pay to park in a small parking lot located across the street from the aquarium. When we went on a Sunday, we did not have any trouble finding parking. Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone! It is definitely appropriate for any age!"
154,2019-08-16,4,"I have been visiting occasionally since 1989. In the beginning it was truly extraordinary given that it was new and novel and we were local members with lots of extra privileges. But it was fairly small yet still one of the best technically and educationally in the country. Over the years and repeated visits, it grew in size and complexity without any detriment to the experience. Our last such previous excellent visit was in 2011 and so we planned this family reunion visit this summer to introduce it to our grandchildren. Honestly, it is now so big, expensive and some exhibits now so crowded that at peak summer season, the experience is impaired for all and for small children, very limited appeal. There is pushing and shoving to get to the otters and tank feeding times and similar popular areas, that you cannot read the info cards, cannot see if you are small, even for short adults and the noise level oppressive when pressed 5-8 deep in front of the viewing area. And not enough bathrooms. They are trying metering lines (like highway access) at some exhibit areas but that is not enough. I'm not sure the answer but try to go at off times, hard to do when it needs to be planned within family work and school schedules. Coordinating 3 families from different parts of the country, 4 work schedules, 3 school schedules, we really had no choice either.It is still a wonderful way to see  and learn about the ocean and its inhabitants. They even had a nice new Baja Desert exhibit with lizards and other creatures. It is the least crowded area we saw.  The Jellies and Tentacles exhibit was new in 1994 when I visited and it still lovely to see. They also have a greatly enlarged area to hold the attention of small children called the Splash Zone and our preschooler loved the area. But an adult needs to give up time at popular exhibits to very closely monitor and it is best if it be someone who has been to the popular areas in the past, I think. That worked for us.Pre-teens and teens still can get a good learning experience if they are patient enough to wait to read the displays and big enough to hold their own. I think smaller children being introduced to the Aquarium need to research time of year and time of day for off peak times. It might be overwhelming as it is now. I hope there are options for reduced cost admissions too for low income families so they can experience the learning potential. In the past it was relatively affordable for most income groups but now seems out of reach for so many. I know that local schools have class visit options but that seems to serve a pretty small group. I am sure there are families who could drive from other parts of the state at least, on a budget vacation who could not afford the admission and I find that disappointing.The food options for families in the cafe was also typical museum cafe high prices and I did not see any bag lunch accommodations, so ask if you need it. The Cannery Row eateries outside the Aquarium are typical tourist prices and have limited menus. I may have had my last visit to one of my favorite places in CA but maybe better planning by me or Aquarium staff can remedy the current situation. Most of our group did still have fun and we all learned a lot. And we split it over 2 days with a hotel offer for admission."
155,2019-10-26,3,"Came on the weekend with the family and my two little ones. Of course it was packed, didn't doubt that. I'm glad our daughter had a great time. Staff at the cafe were a bit rude and mute. I was very polite to one of the guy when asking for some soups. He would just stare at me and didn't say anything after I had said thank you but looked at the next person. I can't stand people who bring their ""problems"" to work. Our little ones are still pretty young so bringing them back once more as they get older would be ideal and that's about it."
156,2019-10-07,5,My favorite aquarium to visit.  So many wonderful sights to see.  The sea otters are fascinating to watch.  They are so playful. And my favorite fish was the one who sits inside a Coke bottle with a thing dangling from his head. When a small fish swims by to look at his dangling thing he leaps out and gobbles it up. Nature is so incrdible.   I also loved the big bat Ray's that you can reach in and feel.    And save your appetite to eat here. Such wonderful food. I used to buy a yearly pass so I cold just drop in for lunch when I had business in town.
157,2018-07-25,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is my favorite aquarium! The Aquarium was our first stop during a short NorCal trip and we couldn't have been more impressed! Yes, tickets are very expensive for an aquarium at $50 for adults, but we were able to get a corporate discount. Check the Aquarium's website for a list of participating companies to see if you might get a discount.We were here in time for Summer Hours so the aquarium was open later than usual. This aquarium is huge!! 2 floors of many exhibits + live feedings and shows. Highlight for me was the Jellyfish exhibit. I don't think I've ever seen so many different kinds of gorgeous jellyfish. I also enjoyed the sea otter exhibits.Honestly nothing bad to say about this aquarium, even with its high price. We were able to find street parking around Lover's Point and just walked over. I definitely think Monterey Bay Aquarium is a necessary stop!"
158,2020-01-15,4,Definately a wonderous place for a peak into oceanlife. This place has many exhibits and interesting facts about the Central Coastal waters.
159,2019-09-19,4,"A very impressive aquarium. A must see if you are in the Monterey area.  I think we spent about 2+ hours there and felt like we got to see everything we wanted to.  The otters, penguins and jellyfish are the most popular.  Great for adults & kids...there are a lot of kid activity areas with things for them to do.  What we found most impressive were the many huge floor to ceiling tanks where you could just sit back and watch all variety of sea life swim by.  Deducting a star for the price.  It is almost $50 per adult.  Luckily, we were able to get a discount through a program at my workplace. We also noticed there was a discount on a SF map that we were looking at."
160,2020-01-09,4,"Pretty steep price, it is a great aquarium though. It does get very crowded in places. Having so many great photo places and animals is always the thing you want to see while having many other things withing the aquarium. I do have to say tho the food is lacking quite a bit for a 13dollar mini pizza i would have at least liked the dough not raw."
161,2019-01-26,5,"I could sit in front of the deep sea ocean for the entire day if my family let me. The majestic yellow-fin tuna and the funny-looking sun fish capture my imagination and create a sense of wonder in me. What a treat to be able to see up close creatures that are normally inaccessible and tucked away in the depths of the sea. The sea otters and jellyfish exhibits are my next favorite spots in the acquarium. It's quite a costly visit, but totally worth it!"
162,2018-08-21,5,"If you love fish, then you'll love Monterey Bay Aquarium. If you don't love fish, why're you even in Monterey Bay? This here is a huge tourist attraction and for good reason. They sport some pretty awesome aquariums and a diverse selection of sea life.My personal favorite is the open sea as I would gladly spend hours just basking in the giant tank's presence filled with too many fish to count. It's serene, it's relaxing, and it's awe-inspiring. Of course, I love aquariums and fish and stuff but you wouldn't ever catch me in the ocean. Thalassophobia may or may not be a thing, but to observe the majesty of the marine life from the other side of thick glass is truly wonderful.Anyway, prices for entry are about $40-50 based on age/if you're a student and if you aren't interested in eating at the aquarium cafe, there are many other restaurants around the area. There are numerous parking garages around the area that offer all day parking for a price or meter parking for 4 hours at a time."
163,2019-12-09,5,"My two boys are obsessed with sea life and this place was absolute perfection! Monterey Bay Aquarium knows how to do it right! Not only do the employees provide excellent customer service, they are so passionate about what they do! We enjoyed every display, every feature (the movies were exceptional!) and the history of this beautiful place. Our most favorite? It's a tie between the gorgeous jelly fish and the adorable otters! We could not get enough! We will definitely visit again on our next trip to Monterey!"
164,2019-12-01,2,"****This review is for the aquarium cafe****My husband and I ordered a squash soup and a burger. While waiting for his burger ready, we went to look for table. We had a 14 months old son with us on his stroller and it was packed on Thanksgiving day. I saw one table in the corner across from where we were standing abt to leave so I told my husband to go and ask beforehand to get the table right after they leave since I were watching our son on his stroller and the stroller was too big to roll in and out. We finally got a table, sat down and abt to begin our meal. This Asian kid with her mom probably showed up in front of our table, sat down next to us, told us this is their table (apparently someone was working there told her she can go and grab this table) because they have 7 people. You gotta kidding me!!! No one helped me to look for a table. Frost, It is self service! Second, they don't even have their food ready yet to eat. Then why do you need a table for? Third, it is FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE!!!! I don't know how their system works but it is retarded. A worker there came and told us I will get you a different table. I had enough and we just stood up, went to look for different table ourselves without her help! I couldn't help myself to come there and not enjoy our little trip so we left that table for that rude group of people. I just don't understand. Why do they have to help people to look for a table? After we found a different table, we overheard a table behind us was kicked out too when they (husband, pregnant wife, their kid) already sat down because apparently someone working there had told another couple  to grab that table which was already occupied. What a mess!!! I probably will return the aquarium for my kids but not the cafe. Their service sucks!"
165,2019-03-27,4,"I've been going to this aquarium since I was a small child, it was my first school field trip and since then I've gone every 5 or so years and this last time I couldn't believe it the cost of admission was $75 for my son and I with a military discount. I think that was pretty high  for what you see and with the large crowds and paying adult pricing for a 5 year old seems ridiculous . The place was so packed making it difficult to navigate. The crowds were honestly too much for me that we went through pretty fast and saw about 75% But my son still loved it and they have some pretty great exhibits, the jellyfish are my favorite but I still have to knock off a star because it's overpriced significantly in my opinion."
166,2019-02-21,4,Very interesting- but very expensive.For a 53 year old dad with little interest in seeing fish and a 16 year old son who has a huge interest-  it's a nice way to spend a morning in Monterrey.But it will cost a lot- $50.00 for an adult $40.00 for a student- more than I think it's worth.But if you're on vacation with small kids- it's something you probably need to do.  Once.
167,2019-03-26,5,"Went to the aquarium last Wednesday for spring break. We were visiting from Reno Nevada where we have no aquariums. This was my first time going to an aquarium that I can remember. The experience was stunning. The animals are so beautiful and all look healthy and happy, which is extremely important. The staff was very helpful and made the atmosphere knowledgeable and fun. When looking at the octopus some blonde girl started talking us about all these cool facts and then said ""I'm sorry, it's my day off but I work here"", but really made us smile! We had a great time."
168,2019-09-14,5,Absolutely wonderful aquarium. One of the volunteers I spoke with said they have been rated the #1 aquarium largely due to their vast number of volunteers. We encountered fantastic and knowledgeable volunteers in every exhibit hall. I loved the multiple places to go outside and take in the bay. Lots to see for both adults and kids alike. Also a few great gift shops throughout!
169,2018-08-05,4,"Totally went on a Monterey Bay Aquarium date and it was pretty packed. They told us they were expecting about 8000-9000 people on Sunday and had about 12000 on Saturday. Damn!I love aquariums, I'm a huge fish geek. Love saltwater and freshwater bio life. The aquarium has abundance of exhibits to check out. Plus live shows and viewings of certain activities. I would have to say; weekends are too crazy. Too many parents let their children do whatever the heck they want. Cool place but avoid the weekends. Parents are inconsiderate about their surroundings and their kids are worse. Staff are all friendly. The tanks and fishes are well managed and healthy. It was a big place. I expected it to be bigger but oh well. Nifty huge tanks that house lots of different variety of fishes from sharks, fishes to crustacean. Big pet peeve is that there is too many rockfish"
170,2018-12-31,5,"The gem of Monterey Bay!  It's not just a great experience for kids, but also great for the young at heart or anyone who has any sort of appreciation, curiosity, respect, or love for marine life, the ocean, environment, and preservation.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium is definitely a must-see/must-do for all!It was my first time to this aquarium yesterday, and I kind of had some pretty impressive aquariums to compare it too.  Two of my faves that I've been too are the Vancouver Aquarium and the Georgia Aquarium, both huge and amazing with their own unique features.  I have to say the Monterey Bay Aquarium may be smaller, but it's just as awesome!  I really loved the Open Sea exhibit, the awesome waterfront location, and of course...the OTTERS!  Even the waves and tides feature had me in awe and laughing like a little kid!It was a beautiful Sunday right in between Christmas and New Year's Eve, so it was pretty crowded by mid-morning.  If you come here on any day, I recommend having a game plan!  We arrived early, found free street parking a few blocks up the street, decided which screenings (15 min each) and live feedings we wanted to check out, then explored the rest of the aquarium in between those times. (FYI: a couple of the parking garages nearby charge $15 and there is metered street parking closer to the aquarium.)  Yup, we're pretty efficient like that, but that doesn't mean we didn't run around like little kids enjoying every little thing, because we did!  We got there at 9/9:30am and pretty much got our fill of everything before noon, and never felt rushed or like we missed out on anything.  It was starting to get more and more crowded though, so it was pretty much time to bounce by noon.  We even had time to browse around the gift shops and take in the views outside on the many viewing platforms.One thing we really loved and appreciated was the extensive exhibit about PLASTIC POLLUTION.  They do a great job at educating the public about how garbage, especially plastic and everyday items you don't even think about, are directly affecting our oceans, our marine life, and us!  It's absolutely eye-opening, shocking and sad, and I hope people become much more aware and eco-conscious after learning about some seriously sobering facts here.  Definitely a great addition to the aquarium.One more helpful tip: If you have AAA membership, you can purchase tickets with a $5 discount online.  Whether or not you have a discount though, it's also really good to know that the price you pay for admission goes directly to funding the aquarium and all of their research, rescue, rehabilitation, and conservation efforts!"
171,2018-07-03,3,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is in that ""must-visit"" category when in Monterey, but at the end of the day, I wasn't blown away by this aquarium. Let me start by saying I wanted to absolutely love it. Living in Kansas, you're not able to see any of the beautiful things that they have here, so that's a huge plus. It's $50 a person, and when we went, absolutely packed to the gills. So packed that it would be nice if there was a cap on tickets per day, which obviously would never happen. There were so, so many people to bump into and it made it difficult to get to see the smaller exhibits, which there were many. The jellyfish room was a highlight with darkness all around except for the majestic tanks. Some of the other rooms were kinda meh with kelp forests and sustainability initiatives explained, all of which were cool but kinda easy to breeze through. There was no sea tunnel like other big aquariums, and at missing the wow factor like Atlanta's where there are whales and each exhibit really pops. So should you do it? Yeah. If you're in Monterey check it out and hopefully you take away more than I did. Just with our one year old it was a bit difficult to get in to see everything and left me wanting more out of most of the exhibits you make your way through."
172,2019-01-23,5,"I hope readers forgive me for writing a short review for such an epic attraction, but there is really not a lot I can say about the Monterey Bay Aquarium that hasn't already been said.  If I listed out the amazing exhibits, features, programs, and so on, I would just be regurgitating information.  It is, I think, simply THE BEST aquarium in the country.  Suffice it to say, if you are going to visit one attraction on the central California coast, this should be it, as it is a not to be missed gem that everyone should make time to see.I will, however, list just the few observations I made in this recent visit...This place is much more grounded in the in depth science the institution carries out, along with the other research centers around the region.  It is certainly a very kid-friendly attraction, but adults will find just as much to enjoy here, too.  Near the main entrance is an excellent exhibit about the history of Cannery Row, and the once booming fish packing industry here, which I found very interesting.  And you cannot escape the amazing architecture, perched almost like a castle over the edge of the sea.  You can lose yourself for quite a while just staring out over the tide pools and the bay itself from one of the balconies, not to mention the giant windows on many of their displays from the open ocean tank, to the kelp forest, to the perpetual crowd favorites, the sea otters.Granted, the aquarium is a bit of a victim of its own popularity, as it can become very crowded with throngs of visitors and school groups, especially on weekends.  Tickets are a bit pricey, but certainly well worth the cost of admission.  Parking can be a little bit of an issue, but there are several pay parking lots and garages within a very short walk of the main entrance, and you can sometimes get lucky with metered street spaces.  But apart from that, I really cannot think of any downsides to this place at all, apart from that I wish it were even bigger to let more people come and experience it for themselves."
173,2019-10-06,5,"Overwhelmingly beautiful. Awe inspiring. Moving artwork. I went for a morning because I thought I shouldn't miss it, but I know I'll have to come back, because this is a place you could spend weeks in. Truly feels like visiting another planet."
174,2019-08-16,5,"Great place to take kids! Came during the summer as a college student and it brings back memories! Beautiful place that is huge. Would point out first that they have a deck outside where you can view the sea and the rocks! second, this aquarium is packed  wonderful educational exhibits! My favorite exhibits include: the splash zone (where you're able to touch sea urchins, kelp and crabs), the penguins, and the sea otters! I do wish that they did have a separate place for sea turtles, give them some shine! The cafe is decent, low key reminds me of a dining hall. Food is a bit pricy so I would recommend packing lunches from home."
175,2019-08-08,5,"This aquarium is a delight. It is apparent that they care not only about ensuring people enjoy viewing the various marine life on display, but more importantly conservation. They do a very good job of trying to educate through kiosks and interactive opportunities the importance of the various species of marine life, how we can do our part to help protect them, and why we should. The tanks are clean, beautiful and visually pleasing. Adults and children alike can spend hours here standing in awe of these creatures you never get an opportunity to view. Being able to ""pet"" a stingray is a very cool interactive experience, and the employees do a really good job of supervising to make sure that the animals do not get hurt. The gift shop is wonderful, and there are so many great things to choose from. It's nice to know that a portion of the proceeds goes directly back to the marine life. This is a wonderful place to enjoy for a day."
176,2019-07-03,3,Great aquarium but $50 to get in and we stood 8-10 people deep in front of every single tank and display. I know they want to maximize revenue but it was ridiculous being pushed and shoved from all sides from one end of the aquarium to the other. They need a reservations system in conjunction with some kind of capacity control on busy days. We probably will not ever return at any vacation/busy time.
177,2019-07-20,3,I think I would have enjoyed this more if the attendance had been a bit less. Packed shoulder to shoulder it was difficult to enjoy the exhibits. People standing in the way video taping various things with their Mobil devices-which is fine but be aware others are waiting. Strollers galore and for nearly $100 For 2 adults I guess I expected more. There were some amazing things to see but for that much money there should be more.
178,2018-12-31,5,I love this place. Make sure you have about 4 hours or so if you want to see everything. They have scheduled sessions for different tanks. I think they start at 10:30am.
179,2019-08-15,5,"A great place to go and spend the day looking at a wide variety of ocean creatures. The aquarium is home to ocean animals, short films, interactive feedings, and a cafe to dine in."
180,2018-12-01,5,"DON'T MISS THIS if you are visiting Monterey. This will be the highlight of your trip and your children will thank you. You can easily spend an entire day here. The aquarium strives in ocean conservation and sea life rehabilitation. Through their exhibits you will see up close and personal the little creatures from under the sea. THE COST is $49.95 for adults and $29.95 for children 3 - 12.Children under 3 are freeDont miss out on their daily Sea Otter, penguin, open sea and shark feedings. You can get text updates to your phone about the latest upcoming shows. The sea otter are the cutest little creatures ever ! The exhibits are outta this world. In fact, the jellyfish exhibit feels like you've landed on a different planet. Be sure an check out the Tentacles where the creatures with suction cups live. The Open Sea and Kelp forest exhibit are my favorites because you can get a glimpse of a shark. Leopard sharks are remarkably beautiful. Summer of 2018 they added a hammerhead to their open sea exhibit. Back in the early 2000's, maybe 2004? I was fortunate enough to see the baby great white shark up close before it was released. Hands down the best aquarium! We are fortunate it's right here in our backyard."
181,2019-11-14,5,"So much to look at! I spent about 5 hours going through all the exhibits, and honestly I rushed through the last hour because I knew I needed to leave soon. There are a handful of areas where you can touch sea creatures like urchins, sea cucumbers, and even a ray. I love how close you can get to the birds at the aviary - there is no glass wall or fence, so you are literally inches from them. Bathrooms are never too far. There is a cafe on the first floor with decent enough food. They will also stamp your hand if you want to go outside and come back later that day. They are partnered with some nearby hotels so that if you're staying there you can pay normal one-day admission for a two-day pass. Great idea for those who might get tired from so much walking (or those with kids who would get tired)."
182,2019-07-20,1,"What an absolutely horrible experience. I explained to the person at the door that I am undergoing cancer treatment and needed to use the restroom as I was feeling very sick. She insisted I could not use the restroom till I purchased a ticket. My sister explained that my family would stay behind to purchase my ticket, but that I needed to urgently use the facilities. The lady in front continued to refuse. We stood in line, bought the tickets. Then the restroom turned out to be tucked way into the back. I had to ran all the way there and I didn't make it in time. I will always hate this terrible place."
183,2019-02-20,5,"The aquarium was pretty busy since we were there on a holiday.  The check in was pretty quick even though the line was starting to get long but I think it wasn't as long as it could have been.  The people checking us in were very efficient and polite.   Definitely grab a map if you're not familiar with the aquarium as we dis get lost a couple of times.   There is so much to see and do there.  You can run through it in about 2 -3 hours but you definitely wouldn't see as much as you could.The otter feeding was the star of the show.  You want to get to the viewing area on the second floor about 30 minutes before as there is limited space by the glass.  Everyone was pretty good about letting the kids go toward the front.  They have little monitors above the glass that you can watch if you can't get a live view. They had a jellyfish exhibit was really cool and my son really enjoyed that too.  They had several different types of jellyfish that was really cool.  There were so many exhibits I won't  give them all away, but it was definitely worth the visit.  Go see it!"
184,2019-02-18,5,This was one of the best aquariums that I have been to. There were so many wonderful exhibits to see. My children were in awe the entire 4 hours we spent there. From the jellyfish to the penguins to the octopus (he was huge!). I would return here over and over again. It is wonderful to see the great life our oceans hold. It was also saddening to see all the displays informing you about the trash that is killing the sea life.
185,2018-12-18,5,This is my favorite aquarium I been to. This has lots of marine life and a great educational experience. It's fun to see the otters and penguin feeding. There are so many varieties of ocean sea life. A must repeat visit.
186,2019-10-06,5,Monterey bay aquarium is perfect for walking around learning and seeing the sea creatures it's beautiful and relaxing
187,2019-12-23,5,Very cool aquarium. One of the best ever. Great location too. When you enter it feels like you just went 30 feet under water due to the sheer size of the tanks and the quantity of fish. I love this aquarium and can very easily go back every year.
188,2019-05-26,3,I can't believe how crowded this place is. Long lines to purchase tickets. Buy them in advance if you do come. We paid about $200 for 3 kids and 2 adults just to get in. Then another $20 to park. It was crazy. We couldn't even enjoy the exhibits because of how crowded it was. It was difficult to see anything with so many people standing right in front of the various aquariums. Most of which wouldn't scoot over or acknowledge that other people were waiting so that they could see too. Honestly I doubt we'll be back. It just isn't worth it imo.
189,2018-12-11,5,"What a great place, it all started by a huge and generous grant from the ""Packard"" in ""Hewlett Packard"". It's obvious that a LOT of cash went into building this awesome place. It's massive and contemporary architecture is awe inspiring.    Different sections house exhibits that cover unique sections of the ocean as well as different types of ocean life other than just fish and even land creatures that thrive near the ocean. The tentacles exhibit for example, features octopuses, jellies, cuttle fish, etc. The deep ocean tank has tuna and sharks in a million + gallon tank with 12"" thick acrylic windows  as big as a house! Really cool!   Of course you can find a cafeteria and a huge gift shop but I can't comment on either as I didn't go there.   I'm pretty local to Monterey (an hour away) but this place draws visitors from all over the world. If your in the area definately check this place out, it's trully awesome!"
190,2018-12-09,5,I have been wanting to see this aquarium for years!  It is the benchmark for aquariums and it did not disappoint.  The layout is huge and we spent roughly four hours exploring everything.  There are sea creatures I had never heard of let alone seen before which was exciting.  It underscored the importance of protecting our oceans and what is at stake.  The entry fee is steep - about $50 a person but well worth it.  We also went out on the viewing deck and saw sea otters and sea lions in the wild.The staff that we interacted with were very knowledgeable and happy to answer questions.  Their enthusiasm was fantastic!
191,2019-07-02,5,"Took my daughters Mid-June on a Thursday afternoon to visit the aquarium. Parking is a block away at $15 for the whole day. It was pretty busy for a Thursday afternoon. There was a line to get inside the aquarium but went by fast. Admission: adults $50, kids $40.  (Aquarium is a 501c, tax credit) At the entrance there is a bag check. No outside food however, I did have my daughters snacks and water. They didn't mind. Cameras are allowed but flash restricted in some areas.  In and outs are allowed with a hand stamp. Get a map, so you can check out what programs are coming up.  They have programs and feedings starting about every 30 min. Very kid friendly aquarium, if you have younger kids you will really enjoy the splash zone on the 2nd floor. They have touch pools, a play area, and much more for the little ones. It's a beautiful aquarium with great educational programs offered. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. We ate at their cafe, grabbed a few things and sat by the window with an ocean view.  Cafe Food was average, not too many options to choose from."
192,2019-02-06,5,"Educational and fun, although it gets very busy, so it can be difficult to see all there is to see in peace. Plenty of outdoor space and a restaurant overseeing the ocean."
193,2019-01-13,5,"This is the great spot for all ages. Used to bring my kids when they were tiny and now just brought my teenager her at her suggestion. We had a great time. Lunch in the restaurant is a little pricey but tasty! It's a bit more quiet than the cafe and seating is pretty abundant. They give you binoculars to use while you're having your meal too. They follow the recommendations of the Seafood Watch list, so you don't eat any items listed on the do not eat list. If you want to pay a little less the cafe is pretty good too. They have tables as well as standing tables too. As for the aquarium, it really is great. How can you not love the otters, penguins and jellyfish! Plus you can sometimes see whales off the back observation deck. Parking around the area isn't cheap, but there is plenty of places to park."
194,2020-02-03,1,This place is extremely overpriced and I was not impressed. Better off visiting your local aquarium. There's not much to see here
195,2018-05-31,5,"Definitely one of the best aquariums in the country.  However, the entrance fee can be a bit steep (even for those with a student ID or senior discount).  Unlike most other similar sized aquariums where they exhibit dolphins and belugas, this one is more specialized in the Pacific life forms and their studies.  Pacific creatures like the Pacific octopuses and sea otters are exhibited year round.Be sure to check out the various shows and feedings available throughout the day.  These include sea otter feeding, penguin feeding, and many more.  For those interested in something more in-depth, then behind the scenes tours are what you're looking for!"
196,2018-12-26,4,"Drove two hours to visit what's supposed to be one of the world's top 10 aquariums. While it didn't quite live up to the hype, it was still a fun outing.On the plus side, the jellyfish and the Open Sea exhibits were incredible. I could stand in front of the glass for hours, mesmerized by the vivid colors and variety. The Kelp Forest was really cool, too, as we watched a diver feed the fish while giving an introductory tutorial to ocean life. Also, the cafe had pretty good food -- though, it was expensive, just like admission. A kid's grilled cheese platter and quesadilla platter (with fries upgraded to sweet potato fries) cost over $30 -- and that was without drinks!On the minus side, I wasn't impressed by Tentacles, as there were very few real life tentacles to be found. Too many animations. Viva Baja wasn't especially memorable, either.Long story short, I'm glad I came. But I don't think I'd want to spend $50 to go again... at least not for a few years."
197,2019-01-27,4,"Clean & plentiful bathrooms, gluten & lactose free food options, discouragement of disposable items, as well as the Infamous Seafood Watch flier... makes not only the actual aquarium, but the whole operation... a strong recommend!  I've been here a few times over the last 30 yrs... I enjoyed this time the best.  The almond milk mocha & gluten free butterscotch cookie started us off right... then when enjoyed 2 leisurely hours exploring every area of the museum.  Educational & well run!"
198,2018-12-15,5,"It's changed a little since the last time we were here. Good changes and improvements. We purchased a buy one get the 2nd day ticket through our hotel, Padre Oaks. Great affordable hotel by the way. It's a little less than $50 a person. We went and ate first so we got there a little late. We seen a little less than half the Aquarium before they started announcing they were closing in 15 minutes. Damn! Good thing we have the 2 for 1! We'll just finish the rest tomorrow before we head home on the Hwy 1! This is the best Aquarium we have been to. Scripps is pretty good too. But this beats that out by far! If you're visiting in the area, make time and see the Aquarium, it's so worth the $$!"
199,2019-09-03,4,"This place is well worth the money, the  money we pay also go towards sending back the sea critters back to there natural habits as well, you can spend the whole day here there is so much to see, ( dont miss the feedings they will you the time and place). Very friendly and helpful staff very clean. All the sea critters here are so beatuiful.   Also check out the beatuiful ocean view outside as well.  i havent been here since 2012 and so much has change, me and my gf really enjoyed our time here, we can on  ture and was very lucky to find street parking in  front we paid the meter if you park on a meter beware i paid till 3:40 but when  i got back at 3:15 is had already expire other then that its has been an amazing trip"
200,2018-10-29,5,"There is a reason this Aquarium is regarded as one of the best in the World. I don't know if I can say enough good things about Monterey Bay Aquarium. Also have a ton of great memories from years and years of being able to check this place out. Stopped by on my last trip to Monterey and was glad to see how busy the place was even during random days of the week. Beautiful views and best staffing and information about all the amazing exhibits and creatures found here. If you are in town with family definitely check it out, the hype is real."
201,2019-06-19,1,Was really disappointed with their cafe and customer service today. Customer service was unorganized and constantly confusing us by going back on what they said or leading us one way and then telling us other things after.The cafe was disappointing because I read online before arriving that they had many options for vegans. They even have vegan signs! But the only option I had was a salad or fries. The salad was just lettuce and vinergette...you have got to be kidding! Get with the times! There is many people who don't consume dead animals and actually understand that global warming is happening...
202,2019-02-17,5,"Beautiful. I can't say anything bad about a place  dedicated to sea life. Each attraction was beautiful and hard to walk away from. It was so relaxing for my family and I to walk thru and look at all the sea life displays. The Splash Zone was super cool! Do not pass up the opportunity for a cool photo shoot or snap chat vid. The kids and I had a blast standing in the tunnel waiting for the water to come! I'll never forget that moment with them. I felt like a kid again. When you walk outside you're breath is taken away by the gorgeous ocean view. There was a nice little seating ""stadium"" area where you can sit and enjoy the ocean view and watch the waves crash over the tide pools below. (Photo below) If you're taking your little ones still in diapers, rest assured. They have an awesome changing area and even an area for nursing mothers. It was clean and off to itself in the ladies room. No worries about anyone bumping into you while juggling a baby on a flimsy table. This was a much nicer built in changing table. 5 stars just for that!Now...I know you're probably getting a little hungry in here, beware! They have an amazing food court with delicious food. Food that you can't get at most big attractions like that. But IT...IS....EXPENSIVE! For a family of 5 I felt like ordering one cookie and saying, ""Take a bite and pass it down!"" We fell into the hunger trap and spent about $40 on a basket of chicken n fries and a salad....my couponing mom friends would be so ashamed lol. I'm sure the proceeds went to the aquarium, and that is what I will tell myself to feel better about that impulse buy. This aquarium is a wonderful place to take the family and spend a few hours looking around, taking everything in. A must for any sea life lovin peeps."
203,2018-11-06,5,"This was hands down one of my favorite aquarium I have ever experience. The layout was beautiful and spaced out. Plus, the view outside was insanely beautiful. I was here for a PCSO conference and had no idea you can rent out the aquarium for a private party.They have a section with different species of jelly fishes and that definitely was my favorite part."
204,2018-04-16,5,"One of the best aquariums I've visited!  You could spend an entire day here to see all of the live animals, hourly shows and regional focus on the marine habitats of Monterey Bay.  As an avid scuba diver who deep dove in these Pacific waters, I love that this aquarium was the first to exhibit a living kelp forest.  You can visit sea otters, penguins, sharks, jellies and thousands of other marine animals and plants!The views of Monterey bay are breathtaking and you are right in Cannery Row to enjoy the many eateries and shops!"
205,2019-09-25,5,"I've been to many aquariums and Monterey Bay remains my favorite. Over 2 million people visit this place every year, and for good reason. The large tanks are positioned in a way that makes it easy for guests to get great views of the marine life. These tanks are not overcrowded, the water looks clean and marine life appears healthy. There's a lot of exhibits, daily shows and feedings. Property is spacious and most employees are informative. Admission for adults is currently $49.95. This is a non-profit organization and most of that revenue supports this public aquarium."
206,2018-11-20,3,"A true tourist spot that I believed wasn't too much of what I expected it to be. I get it , somewhere to actually check out when you are in the Santa Cruz/Monterey area and if you have a family to check out for your kids pleasure. The Aquarium was full, (it was also a Saturday , so expected), once you got in , you can start with the fishes, go outside to see the show or the sea otters, or see the other sections of the aquarium. Every section you had to wait a few minutes to truly see the creatures, sometimes you didn't get the chance to see them because of others either cutting in front of you or how long others are taking. To be honest, probably just would of enjoyed this more when I was little and just did not care at all about waiting and just wanted to see some fish. But unless you are just trying to be educated and in the area wanting something to do, or with your little ones, or a sea life enthusiast, then by all means this is the place to go."
207,2019-05-28,5,"It's bigger than I remember, I think they've added new exhibits. The penguins are adorable. We got there when they were feeding the sharks which was very exciting for the children to see. The jellyfish were magical. The aquarium is big and kept very clean. The souvenirs aren't too terribly expensive. Next time we'll try the restaurant for lunch. Family can't wait to come visit us and the aquarium."
208,2018-03-29,5,"""The mission of the nonprofit Monterey Bay Aquarium is to inspire conservation of the ocean""Behind this elegantly simple statement is the reason why going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium is more than just a fun day trip, it's an important act of mindfulness and responsibility.From its soaring ceilings and walls of glass, take in the California sunshine from expansive decks. Maybe you'll be lucky and spot dolphins or sea otters in the wild. The exhibits are thoughtful and inspire a sense of wonder and peacefulness especially the jellyfish or kelp forest.  Amphitheater seating allows you to immerse yourself for as long as you wish. There are many interactive exhibits especially fun for children. Watch them furiously work hydraulic pumps, press light up buttons or have their movements translated into a bird flapping its wings and gliding.The impact of plastic in our waters and food chain; information on sustainable seafood and responsible fishing; a beautiful orca sculpture evocative of the ""Blackfish"" documentary, you can't help but have the Monterey Bay Aquarium's mission deepen your resolve to be more ecologically minded.It's a wonderful spot though I do wish they had less expensive admission tickets: The pricing puts it out of reach for some families."
209,2018-10-19,4,"If you haven't been, you have to go.  Its just a thing you have to do and its worth it.  I will warn you that it is a bit pricey to enter.  If you are lucky enough to know someone with season passes then I would ask them for their ""guest passes.""  these are basically extra passes that they have.  I like to borrow one from a co-worker and get in free.Once inside you will find that its easy to navigate.  Try to take in an instructional demonstration as they can give you some info you would not otherwise learn about. The giant aquarium that is two stories is something to see and just stare at endlessly.  Of course, the jelly fish is crazy and is most likely what it is known for."
210,2018-04-11,5,"While road tripping in California, the online world said this aquarium was a must if you're stopping by Monterey and it was definitely worth it :) The staff doesn't bombard you with information unless you ask for it and you can honestly move at your own pace without having a ""right"" path to take. When we first got here, saw different groups of kids on a field trip, but surprisingly didn't run into many of them, it's that's spacious. It was easy to get lost in the Open Sea exhibit, my absolute favorite. Be sure to check event times to catch the feedings! The sardines were mesmerizing.The price may seem steep for an aquarium, but for what the money is going toward, always worth the cause. After visiting, makes me want to take some jellies home :)"
211,2018-12-20,5,"A place everyone must visit at least once in their life. I loved it so much, I became a member. You'll leave in awe of octopus, enamoured with sea birds and in love with otters. Their work is remarkable."
212,2019-08-14,5,"Having been to some of the biggest and most renown aquariums around the world, I can safely say that Monterey Bay is our favorite! What an incredible Place for my children ages 2 and 4 to see amazing local wildlife and to interact with the displays in so many different ways.  From coloring fish on a digital display, to flying like a bird on an LED flat screen we have spent countless hours in the facility.  It's a cant miss!"
213,2019-09-12,5,Finally getting caught up on my reviews from this weekend the highlight was our trip to the Monterey Aquarium. I had never been and had a great time. My favorite thing was the Jellyfish! I will definitely bring my niece next time.
214,2019-08-24,5,Absolutely loved this aquarium and so did my little ones. It was very educational. It had a lot of interacting stations where the kids could get hands on while learning about the sea. It also had little stations where volunteers explained the different sea animals. It was very intriguing for my boys. The outside deck was very nice overlooking the bay. The jelly fish were our favorite exhibit.
215,2019-06-19,5,"I cannot say enough about this place ! Is it a little pricey -yes but it is so worth the cost in my opinion. Everyone is so knowledgeable about the aquarium, species and take the time to explain it. The informative information that they give in the auditoriums were great, they too take time to answered questions about the subjects they would speak on. It's also huge so you could easily stay all day in this place and for that the price is worth it as we'll You can tell the folks really care about conserving our oceans and that shows as well! Will definitely love to come back"
216,2019-03-20,5,"I'm a grown ass man that has never came to this amazing aquarium, smh i felt dumb seeing all kinds of kids exploring this beautiful place at a young age. I was just thinking to my self ""LUCKY!!"" Ehh i aint gonna hate on them little kids cuz umm i'll just tell my self that i'll understand the real history to this beauty as an adult than as a kid. So there i have the last laugh!!! Lol Ok enough with my hatting ass thoughts, came out here on a last minute spontaneous trip wit the wife we honestly had no intentions of coming here but glad that we ended up here. I thought it was kind of pricey for two adults 99 dollas!! But after seeing everything they had inside and the amazing views when you step foot outside on the back balconies i will say it is totally worth it! They have huge tanks wit different fishes and some smaller tanks with octopuses, giant looking eels, my favorite was the amazing room wit the jelly fish omg that so beautiful!! I really enjoyed reading about the history of the canneries and all the poor sardines that they over fished!! Not gonna lie after reading about the sardines i was craving some sardines after smh. I would sooo come back here we walked for 3 hours and the aquarium closed so i feel like we weren't able to really enjoy the whole experience. Totally worth checking out when your out here, so get up off ur shoulders and go visit this aquarium u wont be sad. They also have a place for kids incase u have churrin!"
217,2019-11-23,5,"Just amazing.  The sea otters are my favorite exhibit, I never get tired of watching them!"
218,2019-10-07,5,"5 STAR!!!! Such a beautiful aquarium, so astonishing and mesmerizing. Loved learning about all the different kinds of fish they had. The penguins were so darn cute and especially the otters!!! The exhibits were breath taking ESPECIALLY the jelly fish. The volunteers were so informative as well as the employees and had such an overall great experience. Thinking of getting their passes just so I can keep revisiting. The cafeteria food was a bit pricey and small portioned. My husband and daughter got baked macaroni and cheese, DELICIOUS. Myself got a pizza which was pretty mediocre. I suggest getting food else where but other than that such a beautiful exhibit to visit. It is a MUST!"
219,2019-05-20,4,"Aquarium Private Dining Area! We sought the private dining location due to wonderful ocean views and a lovely and healthy menu options that were shared with ourselves! Top hits were calamari, clam chowder and fish of the day!  Chai latte and a wide variety of teas were great for our meal on a rainy day!Please recognize the warm and friendly staff!"
220,2018-11-10,5,"This is the best Aquarium for kids I have ever been to.  The line forms early, but the entrance process is efficient.  The employees who greet you are knowledgable, helpful, friendly, courteous, and ready to start your adventure off in the right direction. Check times for exhibits some are only once a day.  I would highly recommend the ""Open Sea"" and the ""Kelp Forest"".  The Open Sea exhibit is in a huge room, viewing can be seated in front of the aquarium, standing under the mezzanine, or the upper level mezzanine.  Kelp Forest is three stories high and you can see a diver feed the fish and sharks, pretty cool.Other exhibits include tide pools where you can touch creatures, play areas that are educational and fun for kids. A lot to see, enjoy, and learn. There are many volunteers walking around and information centers, they are extremely helpful and knowledgable.  I highly recommend this aquarium."
221,2019-06-03,3,"I haven't been to this aquarium in about 10 years. For some reason, it feels like they have less actual aquarium exhibits. They seem to have built lots of little play area for kids. As an adult coming with only adults, I wanted to see actual exhibits. What was nice for all of the volunteers who gave us additional information about some of the attractions. I think this place is overpriced for what you see. We only stayed for about an hour and a half and were able to see everything."
222,2018-10-09,5,"I loved my time at the aquarium. Being able to see the bay from almost any area made the entire visit magical. I enjoyed watching the otters play and feed. What made that even more amazing was being able to walk outside and see otters frolicking around the bay!My son, husband, and I all enjoyed the area where you can touch crabs, kelp, and other creatures and plants. My son had never done this before and was entranced.The penguin display was another favorite. My son loved being able to get up close to observe. The inset areas were great for observation.The jellyfish were fun to view as were the large fish display tanks.The entire facility is kid friendly, but there is a section for smaller children that my son had so much fun in! He got to climb, excitement, and play.The aquarium is a wonderful place to visit for all ages."
223,2019-06-02,5,"I've been coming here pretty much my whole life and I can hardly think of a more magical place for a person at any age. While it's a great place to bring kids, its expertly curated in a way that makes it just as interesting for adults. Everyone likes otters. I think this is a place people should return to once every 2-3 years and if I lived closer/had kids I'd probably be a member."
224,2018-09-24,5,"I've been a member for over 5 years... I was 14th in line. Doors opened. We all have our memberships ready. The gentleman greets people slides their cards and says ""hello have a good day at the aquarium"" when I get to the counter he slides my car and says ""yeah do you have your i.d. to go with this?"" I said ""I sure do. I see you have to make sure to card the people with color"" he rolls his eyes at me and then I walk away. Wow ummmm I would get it if they did it to everyone but NOPE. Just me... Ate as the restaurant like I always do. Kayla was very rude and unprofessional. I'll stick to weekdays with the nice kids working the door and when Mr.Ray is working.... the fish are the nicest ones here!"
225,2018-03-22,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is massive and one of the best aquariums in the world!  If you do visit - please give yourself at least four hours because there's a lot to see (plus it's not a cheap entry so get your monies worth by checking out the entire aquarium).  My favorite exhibits include the jellyfish (all sorts of different colors) 1 million gallon indoor tank, live feeding as well as the sea otters.Great place to take kids! Great for adults too :)"
226,2019-04-18,5,"If you have little ones like I do, start with the splash zone then work your way down. It was spring break and we thought that visiting during the weekday would be less foot traffic but we were wrong. It was pretty packed throughout the entire day, and had we started there it would've worn them out enough to enjoy the rest of the tour. It's a great facility with lots of hands-on exhibits for little ones to enjoy. The docents and volunteers do phenomenal work there as well."
227,2019-03-02,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is super adorable!  I love this place.  It's located in the heart of Monterey on Canary Row which is full of unique stores, yummy chocolate shops (I recommend the fudge and the white chocolate hay stacks delicious) and lots of restaurants too.  Monterey Bay Aquarium is lovely and has lots of aquatic life like the sea otter exhibit (it's so adorable watching those sea otters float on their backs), a small movie theater where they show educational films (kind of like Planet Earth; I recommend watching one; very entertaining), large tanks of sea water where you will watch and observe hammer head sharks (wow), school of fishes, and tons of different types of underwater sea creatures.  They also have African penguins and lots of tropical birds too (which makes it fun when you take pictures of them of your phone). You also have the opportunity to get up and personal with some star fish.  They have an open area for guests to touch and look at the star fish and other creatures too like eels that swim right up to you.  An outdoor deck is also featured at the Aquarium where you can go outside and look at the Bay through view finders and a lot of the time, you can spot a dolphin or some walruses.  I recommend coming here, at $50 per person, it's not a bad price."
228,2019-10-18,3,"I love this place and everything that they do for our sea animals and research.  We have held a family membership for a few years.  Unfortunately, we are not renewing this year.  There is no limit as to how many people are allowed in during weekends and holidays.  During our visits over the last couple years, we have been lucky if we can get close enough to see animal feedings or get close to exhibits because of crowds and pushing.  They've added monitors, but it's a long way to drive, to wait in long lines, struggle with crowds, and look at animals on the monitors.  More effort needs to be put in scheduling and managing large crowds."
229,2019-05-28,5,"Love this aquarium! Very clean, maintained, and friendly staff. Love the jellyfish exhibits and they have several different types of sharks."
230,2019-11-24,4,"I really enjoy the aquarium, but I find it a bit over priced $50 per person? I think its a place where kids will have a lot of fun, but for adults unless you are super into aquariums you will love it, I personally was driven more for the hype that the place creates, don't get me wrong I did enjoyed it but just don't think it's worth the price."
231,2019-11-28,5,This place is amazing they are for so many good programs like overnight sleeping and they give you education about sea animals totally it's really nice because it's right by the sea and after you go to the aquarium we can go to the beach and go look for animals!
232,2019-07-15,3,"The aquarium is good, but I do wish they had more exhibits. The ones they do have are tough to see when there are a lot of people and it's crowded. Friendly staff."
233,2019-05-22,3,"We heard that it's a very famous aquarium so we drove 2 hours to visit. We arrived the area at around 11:30am. It's very hard to finding parking. Several garages and parking lots are full and we got the last few spots in the public garage which charges $15. That's a Saturday so they are way too many people in the aquarium. It is very noisy and crowded and we kinda lost the mood to enjoy watching the animals. It's is almost impossible to squeeze in to the glass and take a closer look. And some tourist were very unaware of each other, talking loudly and have their whole family occupying the glass for a long time. We spent less than 2 hours as we were quite disappointed. Other than aquarium, there is a lot more, like beaches and museums to hang around in the area."
234,2018-02-09,5,"What can I say that no one else has? This place holds a special place in my heart. Over the years I have visited and each time I love it just as much. You got to come here more than once to appreciate its awe, especially if you happen to come on a rowdy day. Your in luck if you happen to be staying at the InterContinental The Clement. You can walk outside and be at the aquarium in no time! For others there are nearby outdoor parking lots that can fill up quickly. Getting there early is best. They won't be inexpensive, but it is what it is. Admission has increased in fare. I do think it is worth purchasing the individual membership that includes unlimited visits for one year. Two visits and you already get your money's worth. There are benefits to being a member including discounts on tours, sleepovers, and special events. For those that want more of an intimate experience there are quite a handful of tours and adventures for the young child to the one who may be proposing to his or her one and only. I highly recommend you take a curious look. Here is the link that shows the possibilities of new memories and experiences! montereybayaquarium.org/…Don't come during the weekend and do your best to avoid holiday and vacation seasons. Your time with the Monterey Bay Aquarium may not make a good first impression. Among the hustle and bustle it can be difficult to really enjoy yourself among the world of the ocean.Everyone has got their favorites about this place, but mine are the Viva baja, kelp forest, open sea, jellyfish, sandy shore aviary, and life on the bay. When there's only a few around, take advantage and immerse in the wonderment. Life on the bay is outdoors. It is always refreshing to sit out, listen to the water, and enjoy the view of the endless open. I always feel at peace and relaxed when I leave this place. I think you can too!"
235,2019-08-09,5,Great edutainment experience. If you want a decent view for feedings get to the viewing area early (15 min or more). Otter feeding was especially crowded. I appreciate that they request kids be allowed to go to the front of viewing area but some kids seemed to take advantage of this accommodation. Jellyfish exhibit was simply amazing. Monocular set for viewing wildlife on the deck - mom and otter pub in the sea grass. Personnel in the gift shop were knowledgeable and very helpful. A very nice family oriented experience.
236,2019-06-03,5,"This place is awesome to visit! Whether you e field trip with your class, out on a date or on a family trip; this place has something for everyone! A full day here is barely enough time to experience all the exhibits. You could literally spend 2 entire full days here to really have the time to take all in. The best is the feeding time demonstrations at the sharks and sea otters. The restaurant/cafe located in the aquarium is pretty nice too. It can be a bit pricey if you have a big family, but if you plan ahead and pack a lunch for the kiddos, you can save some money. I"
237,2019-03-10,5,"Definitely one of my favorite places to visit. I recently took my aunt and she loved it. They have a huge variety of different exhibits to see. It gets a little packed during the weekend but that's expected. The whole staff is polite and they genuinely want to teach you about these different species. Price is acceptable for the amount of things they have. I recommend everyone to buy the season pass if you plan to come more than twice in the year.  I'd recommend to find meter 4 hour parking if you can, it was only $6 for me. Any garage parking is $20 or more. The meters also accept card!"
238,2019-01-06,5,"I absolutely love this aquarium! We were lucky to go with two free tickets, which saved us some money on the expensive tickets. This was the first time my family and I had ever been but we had a great time! This place is huge, there is so much to see everywhere you go and it took us a few hours to see everything going at a reasonable pace. All of the staff are very nice and helpful and will answer to anything you need. It was helpful having a map in order to schedule out which exhibits we wanted to see. There are plenty​ of animals to look at, family-friendly activities, little shows for feeding, and useful information at each location. My favorite exhibits were the Open Ocean and jellyfish, and the outside deck overlooking the bay is beautiful."
239,2019-11-17,5,"So much fun. It was a big aquarium and could easily spend 2 hours there. The deep sea exhibition is not to be missed and the jellyfish, absolutely mesmerising. Quite busy on a Saturday afternoon but worth the crowd."
240,2018-01-23,5,"""The first time I ever saw a Box Jellyfish, I was twelve. Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I never forgot what he said... That it was the most deadly creature on earth. To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen."" - 7 PoundsI love the above quote from Will Smith who played ""Ben Thomas"" in the tearjerker movie. No, I didn't cry, silly, but it was one of those moments in time, be it in a movie, or climbing a mountain, to remind one that beauty is really in the eye of the beholder. Ahh, If beauty is in the eye of the beholder... there's lots of beauty at the Monterey Bay Aquarium! Of course you'll see the absolutely adorable penguins & sea otters. And no one with 7 pounds of brain matter will disagree on the ""cuter critters"" of our amazing planet, but how about the less eye candy critters like the sea urchins, sea slugs, angler fish, flounders, hammerhead sharks, et al. I mean everything is beautiful to someone, right? The minute you walk into the Monterey Bay Aquarium you feel like walking into a NatGeo episode, sans the wild part. Yet, the reason I love Monterey Bay Aquarium so much is it's located on the coast and how it blends in so naturally with the surroundings. The ocean comes and goes as it pleases, off the balcony you can see the giant kelp dancing beneath the waves, and the sea otters living life to it's fullest in their environment. The smell of the Pacific is so comforting. You feel, unlike other places, it's all about respecting the environment and learning about the wonderful animals that share the planet with us. The motto, ""The mission of the nonprofit Monterey Bay Aquarium is to inspire conservation of the ocean.""There's also a cafe, coffee bar, and restaurant on premises too. Though it might be on the pricier side it's of high quality. Plus the Ocean views are priceless! The gift shop is also a fun place to find that unique item. General admission is as follows:Adult $49.95Child $29.95 (Ages 3-12, under 3 free)Student $39.95 (Ages 13-17 or college ID)Senior $39.95 (Ages 65+)Membership & Events are available too.All in all, I highly recommend the Monterey Bay Aquarium to all. Bring the family, loved one, friends, or even go solo. The high ratings are a reflection of how much this aquarium is loved by visitors and locals alike. I'm sure even the sea otters love it here.  And how can I not mention the amazing Mola Mola exhibit! If you don't know what a Mola is... imagine a gigantic Disney cartoon fish with a smiley face! Lol! You have to see it to believe me! Lastly, I end with positive thoughts about the ""Ben Thomas"" quote, and a reminder that every living creature, big or small, has the right to share this amazing planet with us... it's as beautiful as we want it to be..."
241,2019-10-02,1,"Planned for a long time to watch with family and friends to watch the ""Open Sea "" feeding @ 11am. Saw it years ago and was truly amazing to see the tuna circle and feed. Checked beforehand about the show and this morning as we all entered. They had a mackerel feeding  today! What !!?? Absolutely disappointed and even asked a number of employees and  was told sometimes they change it up. That's not what I was told before I arranged this trip . Will never go here again"
242,2019-06-11,5,Got to spend the day. It has been 25 yrs since I was here. Ofcourse it has grown and updated. Still a great place to visit. Decent food choices and friendly staff. Was lucky to attend on a day not over crowded by school kids.
243,2018-02-22,3,"Came here on Monday of President's Day and it was SOO crowded. I haven't been to Monterey Bay Aquarium in years but I figured it would be fun and educational place to take our 2-year old godson. The line for ticket purchases was incredibly long but thankfully we had Guest Passes to go in so getting inside for us was relatively easy as there was a separate entrance for us. Definitely recommend buying tickets ahead of time $50 per adult, $40 w/ student discount. Sadly, the organization of the place really stopped at the entrance. The rest of the place was a free-for-all and on a crowded day/weekend its an absolute zoo er aquarium I should say! This place is really a one time place to go if you have never been. Crowds of people shoving a TWO YEAR OLD aside to take their pics. Would have been nice if the aquarium had some sort of pathway that everyone should follow to view everything just to keep the flow going. We ended up never getting to see the Baja California exhibit and a few others due to the crowds. I liked the no stroller policy in certain exhibits but they didn't really have a secure place to park it. We were asked to leave our stroller and we did, but when we came back someone went through our stuff and left our jackets on the ground! WTF?! Keep valuables with you at all times people. Not even at a kids place... SMHMy godson had a blast, but had we paid the $80-$100 for the 2 of us to go we would have been pretty disappointed. I would think with what they are charging they would able to keep it better organized and staffed.  All the employees were very nice though even the volunteers were knowledgable.Go once if you've never been but you won't get your money's worth with a 2- year old. Watch out for your kids stroller being ransacked by thieves."
244,2019-04-29,3,"I've been here many times in my life but this one was difficult so I had to post about it. The crowds were the most intense I've ever seen. There were exhibits that we couldn't did get close to because of the rude people. They need to do one of three things, have someone guiding people from exhibit to exhibit, rope it off so everyone has a chance to SEE the fish and things they came to see or don't let so many people in. Limit capacity. It was so bad that I would have rated it lower but one employee improved my experience outside by the binoculars. She talked to us and was very engaging. She pointed out otters, sea life, and spoke about all kings of whales. I wish I knew her name but she was great! We didn't stay for long because of the anxiety of all the crowds of people it gave us."
245,2019-11-09,4,"A little pricey but there is a lot to see. Go early when it opens, the jellies are amazing. Nice gift shops"
246,2018-01-17,4,"So the Monterey Bay Aquarium has so much to offer, but there is one negative item... the cost.  It is literally $50.00 for an adults admission.  And people are willing to pay this, I mean swarms of people.  This is a high rolling touring destination to say the least.Now, let's move on to the positive.  There are amazing exhibits of so many different fishy items,  My favorite was the jelly fish, but my sons fave was the sharks and the sting rays.  The aquarium is located in Monterey, California int he heart of Cannery Row.  It is so beautiful and there are many restaurants to visit.Try to visit this location when it is not a holiday, that way you can ""beat the crowd.""  All in all, it is a great experience, but you do not really need to go more than once."
247,2018-01-05,5,"Thoroughly impressed. The aquarium sits close to Cannery Row and overlooks the Monterrey Bay so you see the waves and the ocean. I recommend parking in the big parking lot for visitors ($10/day) off of Prescott. It's worth it since you'll be in there a while, will probably eat and explore the area, and won't want to go in and out to refill your meter (though you most definitely can find street parking). If you get hungry, they have their own cafe - but I recommend going out and exploring, there're great food options nearby.I'm not a big wildlife person, but even then I was impressed. My favorite exhibit was the jellyfish exhibit, but the shark exhibit  was also quite fascinating. Everyone, of course, has to check out the Nemo/Dory tank. This aquarium is one of the most kid friendly I've been to, from touch pools to large aquarium themed play areas. If you don't have kids and have an aversion to large crowds of children, don't go on a weekend or close to a holiday."
248,2018-03-01,4,Definitely one of the better aquariums I've been to. Admission is about $50 generally but $40 if you have a student id (or proof of a .edu email). The aquarium is large and has an interesting layout.. lots of little nooks and crannies with sea creatures and such. There are some interactive activities such as penguin and otter feedings.. it gets crowded.. so standing room is limited. I definitely learned some things while here. There are lots of simple fun facts about all the little sea critters this place has. Staff are friendly. There is also a very small corner dedicated to cannery row history.
249,2019-09-23,5,"We visited from Reno yesterday and it was worth it! My son is ten and he will remember this visit forever I'm sure. My only complaint is the $80 for both of us for a day visit. For what's offered I think $50 would have been more fair, however, it was a wonderful experience and I'm happy to donate to the organization. We were grateful to experience the sea otter feeding and learn more about climate change. The videos offered were incredibly made and presented and the common area outside where you can watch the ocean leaves you speechless. We didn't stay all day but definitely got a lot out of our visit. Thanks for the great experience!"
250,2019-09-22,5,"The best aquarium. Tanks are well kept and clean, fish are healthy. Amazing views of the ocean and the food court offers decent food!"
251,2019-02-13,5,WOW ! My wife and I paid a visit to this incredible aquarium a few years back. We spent a few hours looking around and stopped for a nice lunch at their restaurant. It's a very impressive structure with lots of interesting and engaging marine life exhibits. We were very impressed !
252,2019-07-02,5,"Every time when I visit here feel new and excited, really nice and beautiful place when visiting Monterey, I think this is the number one or top in USA ,all staff are friendly and helpful,really enjoyed the the visit ,hoping they doing better all the time as usual"
253,2018-11-21,5,"I found this one on my way back to SF. I thought it probably wouldn't be any different than any other aquarium with shark, some fish in the tank that with glared window and mammals you can only observe from like a mile away.This aquarium is the best of all the aquariums ive ever been like Orlando sea world, San Diego sea world. They are big and have more stuff than Monterey Bay, however Monterey is the most interactive one among all of them. I saw birds right like 1 feet from me walking so closely and sea otter pad their cute fluffy face whiling swimming belly up...since it's a quick stop if I knew this was this fun I'll spend the whole day here!"
254,2018-10-09,5,This is totally the best aquarium I've ever been to. We had an awesome time. It all started right at the entrance where you are greeted by someone holding a cylinder of water filled with baby moon jellies. Don't worry they switch them out every 15 minutes. The level of interaction at this aquarium is so far above any others that I've been to. They have an incredible reef section which I'm pretty partial to and their giant tank that holds the Great White Shark every so often is unreal. You CAN NOT miss this if you are in Monterey. It's within a block from Cannery Row as well so there's lots of other things to do and places to eat. Have a blast!
255,2018-07-18,5,"The aquarium is soo huge!! It really makes the Aquarium of the Pacific and the Birch Aquarium look tiny. There are 2 floors and each floor has 3-4 exhibits/habitat rooms.I suggest making it early to the feeding programs if those interest you - especially the sea otter one, that one was packed! I also suggest going on a week day if you can, we went on a Saturday and it was very crowded - lots of families and children running around that it was hard to get a good view at some of the animals.Check Triple A for ticket discounts!"
256,2017-12-14,5,"Finally checked this off my bucket list!! I've been wanting to visit Monterey Bay Aquarium for at least 10 years, but I live on the East Coast. I finally got my chance to visit and it lived up to all my expectations. Tickets were kind of pricey (~$45), but it all goes towards the care of the animals, sustainability efforts, research, animal rehabilitation, etc. so I didn't feel bad about spending the money. There really is a lot to see and experience, so I'd allot at least two hours here. My favorite exhibits were the sea nettles, kelp forest, jumping blennies and the outside deck. I could spend hours just sitting on the deck, enjoying the view. All of the staff here are friendly and even the volunteers were extremely knowledgeable. Definitely worth the trip out!"
257,2019-09-03,5,It was a great trip to the aquarium. We enjoyed seeing all the marine animals and birds. The exhibits were all very interesting including the trash art upstairs to make a statement. The outdoor area is unlike anything I have seen and makes the experience unique. We got the membership on the first day and look forward to more trips.
258,2018-07-06,3,"The admission fee is quite a pretty penny (over $50 per ticket!). Also, there weren't many exhibits. I was disappointed in their limited shark tank and their food court is pricey, so I would suggest eating at one of the restaurants on Cannery Row, the boardwalk in Monterey Bay.However, I really enjoyed seeing the sea otter exhibit and the octopus exhibit. It was terrific getting to visit Monterey Bay Aquarium for the first time, but the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific is light years better in getting your money's worth!"
259,2018-09-04,4,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is very engaging with a lot of different animals that you can see. The staff is very knowledgeable and it was so awesome to walk by the exhibits and we were lucky enough to walk by when the sea otters were being fed. They were so adorable and it was such a great experience to witness! I also really liked the emphasis on buying sustainable seafood and reducing pollution. There were so many different sea life creatures that you can see and learn about. The downside is that there are long lines so I would recommend going early. I would also avoid going during the weekend since there are large crowds and a lot of kids that are running all over the place.
260,2018-08-17,5,"Located in Monterey, MBA is a very famous aquarium known for its regional focus on the marine habitats of Monterey Bay. It was also apparently the first aquarium to exhibit a living kelp forest when it first opened.After expressing that I thought the aquarium at the California Academy of Sciences, my friend suggested we drive the 2 hours down to Monterey to check out the aquarium there. It's supposed to be one of the best aquariums in the US, which I firmly agree with after visiting. It's not the best aquarium I've ever been to - that distinction goes the Osaka Kaiyukan. But it is, by far, the best in the US that I've been to.We arrived around 1:00pm, too late to try to grab a spot to see the Sea Otter feeding. So we opted to walk around the aquarium first and then come back around 3:00pm to grab a spot. Definitely get there early if you want to be up close and personal with the glass.I loved the different exhibits. BF absolutely had a ball with the jellyfish and tentacle exhibits. He loves jellyfish and octopus, so this was a treat for him.There are a ton of gift shops around the aquarium and I think they're all reasonably priced for aquarium gift shops.Tip: Buy your tickets online on your phone before arriving. We scanned the tickets on our phones and didn't wait to get in at all. The line to buy tickets was quite long."
261,2019-10-07,5,"A wonderful place to visit no matter your age. Even living in the area and visiting often, I still feel the magic of visiting the aquarium like when I was a young child. We became members last year and it was worth every penny."
262,2019-10-30,5,"So fun! We loved this place and if you come to Monterey, this aquarium is not to be missed. The sea otters are not to be missed- they were adorable!"
263,2019-03-26,5,"Love love love this aquarium. The otters are awesome, the jellyfish exhibit is outstanding (although we missed it this time). There is plenty of great things for kids to do and see here. The little one kept asking to see the octopus and boy that is a large octopus!!! The penguins did look a little sad, they used to have rocks to gather but didn't see any this time. The variety of fish and sea life you see here is really fantastic. It can get crowed and it has a lot to take in but well worth the trip."
264,2019-08-16,2,$150 for 2 adults and 2 children! It is a very nice aquarium and has some great exhibits but it is not worth the admission fee. We saw everything in less than 2 hours. I used to go often as a kid but this place is now way overpriced. Its worth checking out maybe once but we will not return. Your better off finding a beach with a tidepool.
265,2017-12-27,4,"Expensive, but worth it  ($50 per person).  Understand when you enter, that you will most likely not spend enough time at every exhibit.  At some point, you will reach Disney-style burn out from the crowds, time on your feet, kids running around, and too much to see. The exhibits were engaging and beautiful.  Especially the jelly fish.  I could sit and watch them for hours, almost like watching a crackling fire in a fire place or other hypnotizing scene.Food was mediocre.  Admission includes re-entry.  If you think you will reach burn out after a few hours, it might be worth it to have lunch outside the aquarium to get a break, then go back in.I learned some things, too.  Especially the interactive display about sustainable seafood."
266,2019-01-16,5,"I love this place for so many reasons and not just because they suck you in with the cute sea otters. They have a message and a mission, and oh the cute otters. Very updated aquarium, there are lots of things to see and some great little interactive kid play areas inside the building. We bought the family annual pass. We haven't used it as much as we would like since its a big drive from home, but its worth it when we do. The food here is on the expensive side, but really good, or at least the first time we went it was great. I went back with my dad months later and it was the most horrible chicken I had ever had. We both got roasted chicken, salad and he had soup and drink and the bill was close to $70. There is plenty of parking around the aquarium, you just have to keep your eyes open."
267,2019-05-05,4,"Visited on Easter Sunday. There were lots of families and children, which sometimes made it difficult to see exhibits. We skipped all of the shows and feedings, because it was just too busy. The aquarium itself is great. It took about 3 hours to walk through and view all of the exhibits. My favorites we're the Ray touch pool and the jellies."
268,2019-04-08,5,"Man who could not love this place. From the minute you walk in you can tell that everyone who works there cares so much about their work and making people excited about marine life and preservation! Although the aquarium can get VERY crowded, there is so much to see and learn about you won't get bored! Make sure to check out the free shows and feedings. This is when I feel like I learned the most. We especially like the movie and sharks and learning about their migration patterns. The deep sea feeding is also not to be missed. So many amazing fish and species in one place! Overall the aquarium is great and not to bed missed. There are also lots of restaurants in the area."
269,2017-12-11,5,"This is a wonderful aquarium that really spotlights local fish and global sustainability.Currently on the second floor, there is an exhibit about plastic and the sea, very educational for children and adults.It's expensive, $50 for one adult so a family might consider buying a membership which  includes a discount at the gift shop. It's also tax deductible."
270,2019-03-12,5,This was my first time back in 25 years.  I was impressed with exhibits especially the open ocean exhibit.  The feeding at the open ocean exhibit is as Closs as you can get to being a camera man for Planet Earth.
271,2019-10-13,5,"Beautiful aquarium! There's much to see for both adults and children.  Parking could be an issue if you don't have a lot of time to spot any street parking, or if walking is an issue with your party.  Line is long to get in in the morning but we came around 11am on a Sunday and probably spent about 5-10mins to get in.  We purchased our tickets on the door, the day of, and that was stress free.  They honor military discounts with ID."
272,2017-11-27,4,"Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic aquarium. However, the $50 entry fee is quite steep, but I guess that's how they get you in with their memberships. But if you love aquariums, it's worth trying at least once. Perfect for all ages, especially the little kiddos. There's interactive displays, large glass cases for all to see, a lot of information to learn, small pools to let you touch the wildlife, and very friendly staff and multiple gift shops!The bathrooms were also well maintained and plenty of water fountains as well. There was also a cafe with a large dining area as well. It's about two stories and rather large. I'm a fast museum/aquarium walker and it took me a solid 2 hours to comfortably explore the whole shebang and I definitely could have stayed longer if it wasn't for my pesky tour guide and her time restraints! It definitely gets insane on weekends and I definitely believe parking is a nightmare. However, it's definitely perfect for a day trip because of the shopping area the aquarium is next to. Overall, a fantastic experience, but I wouldn't pay for it again."
273,2019-03-15,4,"I've loved this place since I was a kid! Now I went back as a new mom and have to give a huge shout out to whomever created the nursing lounge! It has great rocking chairs, peaceful music and a video of jelly fish! For a mom used to feeding in the most u comfortable places, this was an amazing oasis!"
274,2018-09-15,5,"A fabulous place for the whole family. If you like sea life, this is a must. We bought the membership and return often. It would be nice if the exhibits would change more often, but still a beautiful place to see the bay and maybe life up close."
275,2017-09-19,4,Very cool aquarium but crazy expensive! I think because of all the hype surrounding it and the prices I was expecting more. That being said it is an incredibly well maintained aquarium with beautiful exhibits. Without seeing shows it will take you no more than 2-3 hours to slowly enjoy the aquarium. Crowds in certain parts of the aquarium were unbearable. Definitely recommend seeing it at least once. If you stay at the Intercontinental next door you can easily walk over. If you purchase your tickets through the concierge you get 2 day tickets for the price of one day. We used our tickets and gave them away for another family to enjoy since we wouldn't be back for a second day.
276,2019-12-24,3,"Really disappointed...at closing time, they wouldn't let my disabled husband use the inside bathroom, but made us go across the museum to one outdoors....""per policy""....whatever!"
277,2019-01-25,5,Highlight: the open ocean exhibit. Also heard members have invitations to sleepovers in the aquarium which is awesome!Lowlight: sometimes the seafood in the restaurant is not that greatAmbience: love how much this place emotes joy and happinessKid friendly? Of courseDishes ordered:Mac and cheese is a must have!!Recommendation: get the membership. Best investment you will make if you have little ones in the family in Bay Area.
278,2019-12-16,5,"Amazing. Wonderfully conceived and executed displays of the bay and its natural inhabitants. Think the kids area is genius. Enjoyed the feedings times, especially those otters!  Take the kids. Take grandma. Heck, just take yourself. You'll be delightfully enlightened."
279,2019-02-09,5,"Ive been going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium since I was a child... and I'm always happy to go back, as it caters to young & old alike. The exhibits are always so interesting, the employees are always willing to educate and inform you of the various sea life they have on display, and the facilities are always clean and family friendly. I couldn't recommend the aquarium more to friends and family. I plan on going there as often as I can whenever I'm in town."
280,2017-11-13,5,"Great & fun place to take the kids for a day out. We've purchased season passes knowing that we will want to come back again. We came here on my day off of work, a Friday, the day before Veteran's Day. It was not busy at all. Weekends are usually pack, but coming on a weekday was a much better experience. If you get their membership passes, there is no waiting in lines! There is another entrance into the Aquarium on the other side of the building.  Just show IDs and walk right in, no long lines to wait in front of. That is a huge plus! The kids always have fun learning about the different aquatic animals. My kids love reading the displays and getting hands on with their demos. Their favorites were the baby otters, getting their feeding times is a must to see with these little cuties being fed in their habitat. There is so much to see! I really love the jellyfish exhibits. The way they glow in the dark is so fun to watch! I think it's totally worth it with the membership price if you plan on coming back again and again. The membership last a year. It's a 3-hour drive for us to get here, but it's worth every memory of my kid's happiness!"
281,2018-12-30,4,"Everyone talks about how big the Monterey Bay Aquarium is, and I'm glad I finally got to visit. With that said, this aquarium is hyped quite a bit, and though it's on par in terms of price with some other aquariums I've been to, it's also not necessarily the best in terms of value (even taking into consideration price for parking). Still, this is definitely a great place to visit for sea-life enthusiasts of all ages. My favourite exhibits were the jellies, cephalopods, Kelp Forest (which basically spans three floors), Open Sea, and Giant Octopus. The Open Sea is very calming to watch, and there is one feeding every day, but I unfortunately missed it. The other feedings happen two or three times a day, so if you miss them in the morning, you can check them out in the afternoon. Normally, I really enjoy the touch pools at aquariums, but the bat rays were all gathered near the wall on the day that I visited. Other than the bat rays, there didn't seem to much else to interact with in the touch pools, so this was a bit disappointing.Lastly, the food options were just okay. It's expected for the prices to be high, but I didn't find the options in the cafe to be great. I didn't check out the restaurant though, which probably had better, but also more expensive food. I did like that they provide the Seafood Watch list of fish/seafood to avoid. This was very informative, and it's pocket-sized!"
282,2019-01-19,1,"For $50 for an adult and $30 a child I feel I should have enjoyed the experience of viewing and learning at this aquarium. Instead I spent the entire time being stepped on by other people, pushed out of the way, jostled, and in general just plain annoyed by how dumb and rude people and their kids are. Everyone with phones out trying to snap photos instead of reading the boards and enjoying living the moment in real time. The aquarium really needs to limit how many people can be inside at one time so that way you can actually enjoy the experience. I'm here on vacation so thankfully I will not be returning."
283,2018-05-31,5,"PRE BUY YOUR TICKET! That line is a force to be reckon with if you don't. The reviews aren't lying, also if you still got that college ID laying around, pull it out! It's $10 off with a student discount, holla! If you are going on a busy weekend like we did, go towards the end of the day! The kiddos get tired and the families head home then is PICTURE TIMEEEE! Seriously show up with your makeup done and your outfit on point. The gram is going to LIT! The feedings are always a blast, and grade A people watching. I got bullied by a 3 year old for a better spot watching the otters, stand your ground people! These kids are ruthless and so are their parents.Ps. The jelly fish and the tentacles are a must see!"
284,2019-02-15,5,Me and my family went there and had a pretty nice experience from looking at the sea creatures to having an amazing view of the oceans.
285,2018-07-03,4,"FIFTY FREAKING DOLLARS PER TICKET. Theme parks teeming with rollercoasters are cheaper to access! Coming from the less than $30/person Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, I was flabbergasted by Monterey's prices. Seems like the best way to lower that cost is to use your student ID, and we bought our tickets online beforehand to avoid the lengthy morning lines, too.I'll start with the disappointments: next to zero sharks (only ones you'll see are the smaller leopard sharks)--ridiculously overpriced cafe ($15 for two lemonades and a bag of chips)--uninteresting auditorium show (the Project White Shark show felt like the closest shot at seeing some sharks in this place but the video footage was without sound and the staff member's presentation wasn't very informative or gripping). For $50, I felt like I should've had my socks blown off at this aquarium, but it did still amount to a wonderful day.* My boyfriend and I spent a solid four hours exploring this place from top to bottom. We watched several feedings and saw every single exhibit in those four hours, despite crazy Independence Day weekend crowds. * There are a few especially impressive exhibits that I feel the need to highlight: the jellyfish (extensive tanks in a darkened room made for an immersive and downright magical viewing experience), the deep sea (a floor to ceiling tank so hypnotically blue that it takes on the illusion of the ocean itself), and the kelp forest (another massive glass enclosure in which dozens of fish and plant species swim around). The otters were cute but way too crowded to get a good look at, unfortunately. We couldn't actually see any of the octopi despite there being several tanks of them (can't fault the facility for shy specimens!)* I applaud how interactive this aquarium is! I've never seen anything like their activities for kids. They have the typical touch pools and whatnot, but there's also tons of screens with digital supplementation, whether that be animation or lessons, as well as simulators and water exhibits. It was very cool.* The aquarium itself is actually quite gorgeous and historic, situated right on the bay. It's also sprawling, making it fun to navigate and spend the majority of your day exploring. If it weren't for the ticket pricing and the lack of sharks, I'd claim this to be my favorite aquarium. I think Long Beach still wins out for me, given their dedication to sharks! But Monterey is a bucket list experience for sure, one you won't regret checking off."
286,2019-04-27,5,"Great place to enjoy a day with the family. The price is not cheap but they offer discounts for kids, students and seniors, which helps keep things manageable.The staff is very nice and helpful, I'd recommend to anyone visiting."
287,2019-03-17,5,Beautiful aquarium. Exhibits are first class. Great feeding times with specific time slots and explanations. Great shows in auditorium. Friendly staff. Great spectrum of marine life to marvel at. Great programs to rehab Sea Lions. Membership is worth it and supports a good cause. Prepare to spend hours here. Gets very busy. Right at the end of Cannery Row. Perfect day trip or weekend getaway from the Bay Area.
288,2018-06-30,5,One of the better aquariums in the mainland. Friendly guides and great interactive spots for all ages.ALSO AMAZING COFFEE!!!!
289,2018-07-05,2,"We have mixed feelings about this place, among them are:- Great collections of marine animals and educational themes.- This place is jam packed especially weekends and holidays.- The tickets are expensive, $50 for adult and $30 for kid.  That's quite a lot if your whole family do go.  But on the other hand the food in the cafeteria cost about the same as any restaurant outside.- There is a section in the aquarium dedicates to the hazards and bad consequence of the use of plastic.  Yet, when we lunched in the aquarium restaurant and we asked for some water.  Sadly, the water was served in a plastic cup and a plastic straw.  This is a classic case when it is easier to preach than to practice."
290,2019-10-10,4,Pros: Very well maintained place with beautiful exhibits and knowledgeable staff. Cons: Pricey for the amount of space they give their animals.
291,2018-06-03,5,"OMG the price scared me! I didn't check the price when we decided to go. I was surprised at almost $100 for two of us. With that said, I hadn't been there since I was a kid and it's such a special place.So, is it worth it? Oh hell yeah! This is an amazing aquarium. The Open Sea tank alone is worth it. It's a 90 foot seamless window from floor to ceiling. Being a scuba diver this is the closest I have felt to scuba diving without being in the water. It gives you a feeling of being enveloped in blue water.We also loved the otters and penguins. I mean how can you not?! We encountered some happy curious penguins who wanted to crowd around me and check me out. It was such a cool experience. They were as curious about me as I was about them.Take a whole day. You're spending a lot to go, so take it all in and fully enjoy the experience."
292,2018-08-16,5,Second time here and decided to watch sit and watch the feedings this time and it was great and full of information and i learned a lot.  Its worth every single penny! the volunteers are full of joy and actually care about their job their visitors. Their are two floors and each has 3 exhibits and they have many souvenir shops. The bathrooms are keep very clean and maintained.
293,2019-12-23,5,I live this place. We come every year from San Jose and it's always amazing and fun for my kids
294,2019-04-28,5,"We made this part of our 9 day coast from LA to Napa. This is a wonderful experience, the people were supper nice and we did a behind the scene tour which was very informative. Highly recommend."
295,2019-08-02,5,"Mad fish!  Love it here!  Wish they still had the great white, but life goes on.  I ain't mad at it!!"
296,2018-09-20,5,"This was such an amazing experience from start to finish. The exhibits are all breathtaking. I've been to a few other aquariums, but this was by far the best one I've seen. It took us about 2 hours to see everything so it was a perfect activity for the afternoon.  My only gripe was that it was extremely crowded when we were there, although I attribute that to it being a long weekend. It was hard to get up close to the exhibits because there were so many people hogging them. I imagine it is far less crowded on regular weekends and weekdays. Highly recommend anyone who is visiting Monterey to go to the aquarium. It is truly a must see!"
297,2018-12-29,3,I visited this place on Wednesday during the Christmas week.  It was $50.00 to get in which I thought was a little bit on the high side.  I visited a lot aquariums over the years and I think this was the most expensive one.  It's probably the largest one I've been to and spread out nicely over 2 floors and a great location over looking the bay.  There are several areas were you can go outside.  I came here around 1pm and it was pretty crowded. Probably would have been best if I had came when they first opened in the morning.  After about 2 hours I left even though I hadn't  seen everything.
298,2018-06-27,4,"The large panoramic tanks are gorgeous. It is a very immersive experience, and we all enjoyed the views. The avian area and the sting ray tank were also highlights.  The price is a bit ridiculous, though. $50 is $10 more expensive than the Shedd Aquarium which is way more extensive than this place. However, it is in a SUPER touristy district, so perhaps it's geared toward free-spending vacationers. Also, you can stamp your hand to return anytime later that day. But most people don't do that, obviously.We made a special trip to see the penguin feeding, which was actually the low-light of the visit - a hoard of families crowded tightly together watching a pretty small display through the glass, with a lot of schtick that missed the mark. There are great views of the water next to the feeding area, however."
299,2019-09-28,1,"Over priced, over crowded, lots of screaming kids, and it is supposed to be a non profit, LMAO.Very hypocritical about being good for the environment. What a laugh can you imagine the fossil fuels burned unnecessarily from all the tens of millions of people that come and visit the Aquarium polluting Monterey Bay?Most all locals who grew up on the peninsula despise the changes to Monterey that the Aquarium has brought.Just overall a bad experience."
300,2019-09-20,3,I love this aquarium but it's hard for little one to get close enough to see the sea life in the big tanks.  Our grandsons really liked it except for that
301,2019-12-13,5,"Such a great aquarium! Overall, its a bit smaller than some in other parts of the country but their animals are very lively and the staff is all very friendly. My husband and I showed up with just an hour before closing, and the ticket taker was almost hesitant to sell us tickets because she was worried we wouldnt be able to see everything. We were just passing through so it was now or never, so she gave us a map with the perfect route for us to take to see the major attractions on limited time."
302,2017-07-25,5,"I love a good aquarium, and this place goes above and beyond that description.  As the focus and main destination of our trip, the Monterey Bay Aquarium was something we were all looking forward to and very much enjoyed.  Waking up early and heading over right after breakfast, we ensured we were there when the doors opened and beat the crowds that would later swarm later in the day.  Getting tickets was easy, getting through the entrance was quick, and our first attraction, the otters, were nearby and easy to find.The exhibits are beautiful, massive in size, and each have multiple ways to view them on multiple floors, allowing throngs of spectators both ample room to see, as well as differing angles to catch better glimpses of any animal they fancy.  Their collection is extensive, with pretty much any smaller creature you could want and they have models and attractions showcasing anything too large to contain in any one exhibit.  There's also an area specifically designed to cater to any child that needs to run around with other active and screaming kids and take a break from calmly enjoying one display after another.But, by far the coolest thing about Monterey Bay, is how some of the larger exhibits flow and breathe, feeling like they're alive and not just self-contained aquariums.  Instead, they seem like windows into the ocean, that were searched far and wide to choose the perfect view.  To give you an idea of what I mean, let me give a few examples...The Kelp Forest spans two stories, dominates almost an entire wing of the building, and consists of a massive tank where strands and strands of seaweed stretch from far below all the way to the ceiling more than 30 feet above.  They sway and float in the gentle current of the water as if waves were rolling through the whole of it.  As it does this, fish and sharks, large schools and single rays, swim between and around, dancing about in their own visual symphony.  Seriously, it's pretty incredible and utterly gorgeous.In one corner is a covered tunnel that repeatedly simulates a large wave crashing down on an exposed coral outcropping.  Kids cheer as they hear and see the waves swell, parents gasp in shock at the first time they see it, and it stays just as cool to watch one wave after another.And then there's my personal favorite exhibit, The Outer Bay.  In a massive room with a glass wall that is bigger than most homes, is a window that looks out into the twilight gloom of the open sea.  Turtles glide about between massive schools of sardines, as sharks and tuna and rays dance about like silvery ribbons in the deep blue of the water.  It's so beautiful and mesmerizing, they actually have seating that lines the upper deck, so patrons can simply sit and stare at the truly awesome display of diverse aquatic life.Plus, they have a mini cafe here that looks out over the bay as you eat.Anyway, Monterey Bay Aquarium, it's funny to think you can plan a whole vacation around this place, but it really is worth it.  I hope I can do this place justice, looking at the photos I took, I'm not sure I can totally portray the sheer beauty and grandeur it offers.  Still, as much as I like to hear myself talk, I had to try..."
303,2019-04-19,5,"The last time i was here i was 6 years old, so it was basically my first time visiting since i forgot most of what i saw. You can tell they put a lot of effort into what they do, at no point do you feel sorry for any of the creatures there, they dont carry any large sharks or whales or even turtles. This is no sea world. The craziest thing we saw was the Giant octopi, it was truly mesmerizing. The food and merch is of course overpriced, but its kind of one of those things you expect at a place like this. Staff is very very sweet and everyone seems happy to be there. There are multiple kid sections with touching pools (which was still surrounded by a lot of curious adults, you're never too old to want to pet a sea slug). Its a very nice and well done aquarium that leaves a lasting impression."
304,2019-04-18,5,"Beautiful , amazing, fun,  family memories for a lifetime! Each time we go we learn more and more !"
305,2019-03-31,5,"Very knowledgeable tour! I came here 2days ago in Monterey in our way for family vacation to San Diego. Discounts available and so many water species with various attractions to observe and study. I wished if I had come here way long before. But it's alright that I made it this year. It is one of the most enjoyable family moments of mine. Thank you, Monterey Bay Aquarium team members for all of your efforts!"
306,2018-06-29,4,"We came here during our weekend getaway to Monterey, and had a great time. Both my significant other and I really enjoy fish and aquatic animals, and this is one of the largest aquariums in the US, so it was a wonderful experience. I think they have both activities for the little ones as well as amazing exhibits for the adults. Pro tip: always check out the feeding schedule, especially the one for the big blue ocean exhibit. I will say however, that it is very expensive for what it is. Tickets were $50/person, which is probably the most expensive aquarium/museum in the area. Overall, I don't regret coming here, but I likely won't become a regular."
307,2019-12-16,5,Very nice time today. Lots to do for the kiddos and plenty of things to see for kids and adults! Loved the big water areas with all the different types of fish and wild life. The penguins will always be my favorite!
308,2018-08-12,4,"This was my first time at the Monterey Aquarium and maybe even my first visit to an Aquarium overall! I didn't have many expectations other than the fact it's a very popular tourist destination. Thanks to our air bnb hosts, we were able to use member passes (free entry) and avoided the lines! Super kid friendly. Loved the interactive learning games and employees stationed at different locations to help kids understand/touch all the animals. I would say the aquarium itself was a good size, not too overwhelming but still had air of variety."
309,2019-08-29,5,"I've been so many times it's hard to say what's best. I'd highly suggest watching the films they have available throughout the day, I always love that. The jelly fish and giant open water displays are fantastic and if you want to get hands on then you have many options. Seriously one of the best aquariums in the world."
310,2017-07-05,5,"This place is amazing! I mean it! The do not have any whales. Which was the only thing I found dissapointing. Well actually, I was also disappointed the aquarium was not voice narrated by Leonard Nimoy. After seeing Spock jump into the whale tank I talked to the well on Star Trek. I was really expecting to see the whale there. They have a cool touch tank, huge deep sea tank with a hammer head shark and sea turtle just swimming. I was very impressed with the pure number of octopus they had. Iv also never seen cuddle fish in person before. The cuddle fish are really easy to tease but at the same time they kept posing for my camera. I asked one out loud. ""It would be nice if you turned and looked at me"" and it did! Like what l? Cuddle fish speak English? No way!Saddly I was not allowed to play with the sea otters. They remind me so much of ferrets just swimming, rolling around doing flips and eating tasted fresh seafood.The coral tanks were nice and bright lots of cool coral. Make sure you check out the jellyfish in building two! It's like a lava lamp. I totally want a jelly fish wall in my house now!"
311,2018-11-23,4,"Without a doubt: By far BEST aquarium in west coast. Staff are super-friendly. This is def not a dig or a negative comment, but the Monterey Aquarium places it's primary focus and attention on the sea-life vs the customers/public (which how it shld be). 1. My only real complaint is the parents and other customers. First of all when u push ur children ahead of everyone else's kids u are not only being incredibly rude but i'm also thinking u r teaching ur kids to be selfish lil brats as well where it's about their individual wants/needs and not having any common courtesy to others. 2.The double-wide strollers u parents have, yes are handy and useful but in crowded places trike these, those dbl-wide strollers are such a pain in the a$$ for everyone else."
312,2018-10-27,4,"Wonderful exhibits but very, very crowded, long lines to get in! Try to visit on a week day to avoid the crowds."
313,2019-08-31,5,One of the best aquariums I've ever seen! My kids loved seeing the otters and sharks. We watched a couple shows in the auditorium and spent about 3 hours looking at all the cool sea animals in the exhibits. They also have wild seals and otters in the kelp beds just off the aquarium with free periscopes so you can see them in the wild. Very cool!
314,2019-06-09,3,"We went here for Mothers Day and it was SUPER packed! I haven't been here since I was a little kid and the second time was Mothers Day.  I felt like it was much different, they had so many of the same fishes and I enjoyed penguin world. My baby was a bit scared of the fish but she was ok when her dad was holding her.  The weather was a little cold that day.  For some reason, it wasn't as big as I remembered when I was little.  I dont feel like a saw a huge variety of sea life.  Not sure when I will come back but hopefully on a day when it's not so crowded. We got lucky with parking, a nice family in a nearby lot across the street from the aquarium gave us their all day parking pass.  I hope that there will also be more of a variety next time I come back!"
315,2018-12-16,4,"A bit pricey but well worth the experience of a lifetime.  Prepare yourself for a day of underwater delights, and leave with knowledge on how best to protect our oceans and our vast aquatic community.Definitely worth a visit or two.  I'd recommend getting a hand stamp, leaving for lunch and then returning later.  You will feel like you got your money's worth."
316,2019-08-30,4,Great experience! Super family friendly. Not 5 stars due to the food. Outrageous food prices. Everything else was amazing!
317,2018-07-17,4,More amazing than we had anticipated! My in laws have been members for 30 years but their description didn't do this Aquarium justice. This is a kids dream! My son watched the otters for a total of 3 hours while we were there and got to learn about them at a movie inside the aquarium. They are not just an aquarium but a research facility as well. The price of the ticket goes to taking care of these animals and releasing those that they can back into the wild. They had a wonderful area for nursing mothers and their food court and gift shops are also every nice. We got to watch kids 8-13 learn to dive right out back in the tide pools which is an unbelievable experience for someone who dreams of working there when they grow up. My only complaint was adults taking selfies and standing in front of kids but that's not going to change. It's a beautiful place and we can't wait to come back!
318,2019-09-06,4,More of a place for kids and for the gf who like to snap pictures of every 40 types of different Jelly Fish. The gourmet Applebees kind of food that they served at night and the live band was a nice touch. I actually thought the food was pretty good! :)
319,2018-12-09,5,"I've been going to the Aquarium since I was a child and finally bought annual passes for my family. The value can't be beat as it pays for itself in 2 visits. My daughter loves the aquarium. The toddler play areas are fantastic. They're clean, safe and offer plenty of activities for her to get out all her excess energy. We always try to get there early as it can get crowded later in the day. For parents with babies, the nursing/changing rooms are great. The aquarium is always clean, the staff is helpful and friendly. There's plenty to see, and I love being able to step outside for fresh air and fantastic views."
320,2018-08-27,4,"I always have the best time whenever I visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I usually get to the aquarium early enough to avoid the traffic, large crowds and long lines, enjoy my visit then head to the beach for some quiet time.  The aquarium has much to offer for all interests when it comes to marine life.  During my last visit, I especially enjoyed the Otter documentary in the theatre.The restaurant and cafe offer nice menus for food and drinks.  I will always return to Monterey Bay Aquarium."
321,2018-12-28,4,"A very well executed aquarium.  Clean and modern feel.  Animals seem well cared for.  Well staffed.  A lot of open space, so crowds do not make it feel cramped.  Very expensive but worth it if in area."
322,2017-09-17,5,"Absolutely loved Monterey Bay Aquarium! It's on the pricey side ($50/adult) but I had my UCLA student ID and got a $10 discount.It was absolutely stunning and I loved loved loved it. I read other reviews saying it was smaller than anticipated but in my opinion, it was much bigger than I anticipated! We went yesterday (Saturday) from 2pm-5pm and were able to see everything without rushing during our 3 hour stay. 3 hours seemed quite ideal.The aquarium is very clean and well kept, and the exhibits were gorgeous! Absolutely loved seeing all the jellies and octopus, they were mesmerizing to look at! The penguins and otters were also so cute, though I didn't realize otters were that big! I always imagined them as being rather small and cuddly but they were much bigger than I visualized! Lol. Still cuddly cute though. Everything was super interactive and education-based, the volunteers/workers were extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and the overall ambience was friendly and fun! Saw plenty of kids laughing and having a blast (and saw plenty of kids terrified of the critters and creatures and crying their heads off). Fishies were so cute, just so sad there were so many surrounding restaurants in the neighborhood cooking their friends and families :( #FishAreFriendsNotFood (LOL) - also highly appreciated the facility educating visitors on capturing/eating seafood and discussing fishing techniques, farm raised fish friends vs. ocean-caught, etc. rather than preaching ""don't eat fish!"" The coral reef tank was awesome, saw the whole Finding Nemo gang in there :) I definitely recommend visiting at least once, it's definitely worth the price."
323,2018-07-09,4,"This is a great aquarium, my sister works in fisheries and has visited aquariums all over the world and this one continues to be one of her favorites!  I visit every few years and it's always a great experience.  Great exhibits, a wide variety of things to see, and interactive exhibits for our little one.  Great stuff and it never gets old- plus spending time in Monterey/Carmel is always great!The only things I don't like?  First, it's expensive!  $50 per adult, that's a chunk of change.  Secondly, it's super packed with people!  On our most recent visit, we came on a Saturday and even at 1pm, it was hard to move around in some places and difficult at times to get close enough to an exhibit to see it.  If you can go on a weekday instead, I'd highly recommend it!"
324,2019-09-01,3,"Pricey but you get to see a lot of sea creatures. A little crowded too. The best part is the short film. In case you do not know, there is a member discount for AAA members.Also, you can use street parking instead of parking in the garage. The garage charges a flat daily rate.If you are visiting California then you can make the most of it by visiting the aquarium in the morning hours and then see the Point Pinos lighthouse and 17-mile drive."
325,2017-11-06,5,"This place was amazing! I've been different aquariums but this one blows them out of the water (pun intended). It's basically the Disney World of Aquariums. The aquarium is separated in different sections, each showcasing a variety of sea life.Staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely a lot to see and learn. Great, interactive place for adults and children alike. My favorite exhibits included the murre (penguin-like birds that actually FLY, so IMO they are cooler), the jellyfish (who knew there were so many types), and the otters. If you are interested or have a kid interested in marine life, this place is where it's at! A must visit!"
326,2019-02-25,5,Very nice place and great exhibits. Very well put together. We ran into a volunteer who gave us insightful information on the filtration system from the Bay waters into the facility.
327,2018-11-20,5,Love this place!!! The sea otters are my favorite.. especially during feeding time. But there are so many great things it's always fun to explore here.
328,2019-08-07,4,honestly the aquarium is nice but not worth the price. many people love it and it is great but my kids were bored way to fast compared to others that we have been to. it is pretty cool they have a lot of touch tanks and I loved the fact that the descriptions were in two diff languages . I spend a good 2 hours.
329,2019-09-12,3,Nice but it is not a big deal. Monterey does have better places to visit and less expensive.
330,2018-04-18,5,"John and I are taking a four day break by doing a Yurt retreat in Carmel which is 30 minutes away from the aquarium. We've been here several times and each time is just as awe inspiring as the last. They have different displays and new sea critters to observe each time we go. Got a great view of the octopus this time. He was really active, stretching himself across the glass and putting on a show for everyone before he decided to get shy and tuck himself into a corner. We didn't realize all the work that goes into running the place until we saw some behind the scenes places which were really cool to see. It's a trip favorite each time and worth the $50 entry!"
331,2018-04-23,5,"One of my favorite places to come ever since I was itty bitty. My parents brought my sister and I nearly every other weekend because we had their family annual pass.Their exhibits are AMAZING, its a great place to get lost and explore the beauties nature has to offer. My favorite was the seahorse exhibit but they replaced it with a viva baja exhibit and a tentacles exhibit and they're both pretty rad as well so definitely check it out! They also had a white shark a while ago and that was pretty cool but that tank is pretty empty right now. Also that sunfish is always hiding in the corners LOLThe thing that irritates me the most is some visitors straight up don't give a F. I've noticed a few take pictures with flash on blinding the animals and the rest of us in the dark room with them. Dude, there are signs everywhere telling you to not use flash. Also, kids repeatedly slapping/tapping on the glass tanks to get animals to move and their parents just like ""oh hahah my kids just trying to get the seahorse to move, its harmless""............ can u not.BF and I ended up getting a season pass to this place and I'm super excited to go again!"
332,2019-06-12,2,"Big aquariums, really nice jellyfish exhibit, lots of neat octopuses. Not the best aquarium I've been to, but pretty legit in a few categories. We really wanted to see the penguin feeding. We got there 15 minutes early and waited up front. Then an angry pregnant lady with a microphone ordered us to take a step back. All right. Then she told us to sit down on the floor or move to the very back. Not all right. My girlfriend was wearing a dress. So we put our backs against the walls on the side. Then she specifically told us to move even farther back despite us not blocking anyone's view. Then she prattled on through the whole feeding of dead fish in the small enclosure. We could barely see so we just left. Was really a lot of pomp and circumstance for a big nothing. Put a huge damper on the experience for us."
333,2019-01-20,5,"One of the best aquariums in the world. We always love coming. Even though we don't live close, we are members.This is a beautiful aquarium and we love spending time here. It does have a lot of children's areas. We love the otters and the jellyfish."
334,2019-02-03,5,"My husband and I went here 11 years ago when we first started dating so he could meet my sister and her kids, i dont know why it has taken so long for us to come back, but now we have a 2.5 year old and a newborn. My toddler was so excited to go, we looked up the animals on their website and talked about them the week leading up to going. We spent 10-3:30 there Saturday and were only able to see the first two floors and hit it up Sunday for 2 hours to see the 3rd floor. She loved every second of it and it is very kid friendly, the staff is great, bathrooms are clean and everyone is so knowledgeable about all the sea life there. We are excited to come back again when our youngest is old enough.My daughter was also excited to pick out her own gifts in the gift shop, 1 sea turtle stuffie and one hammerhead shark."
335,2018-06-23,5,"Ton of reviews so I'll keep this short.I'd been to the aquarium decades ago and afterwards kept their small wallet card that listed sustainable and not so sustainable fish as a reference for ordering at a restaurant. That card, along with helping me make better choices, kept Monterey Bay Aquarium in my mind all these years, so i had to stop in while passing through Monterey. Their work in researching, understanding and disseminating information on the marine world is outstanding.As for the aquarium itself, it's great, although from my non-parent perspective, a little heavy on child exhibits. Love the big tank. I had no idea giant sea bass lived so long! But do examine all the fish tanks - the smaller ones, too. You'll see some amazing critters.Highly recommended."
336,2018-06-10,5,"I hadn't been by the aquarium in a while and was going off my previous experiences, which was that there wasn't too much to do at the aquarium and you could be in and out within 45 minutes. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by my last visit - they had several new exhibits and I spent a much longer time browsing through everything. They really care about sustainability and spreading awareness here, which I love. Everything is clean and well maintained and all the staff members seem to really love working here, which is a great sign. The place gets packed with kids and families during the weekend so be prepared to maneuver around multiple strollers, but otherwise, it was a great date for the bf and I and we would highly recommend others to visit this spectacular venue."
337,2018-04-20,5,"Monterey is a beautiful vacation spot and you will love all of it. While there you must go to the Monterey Aquarium. It is beautiful.It is very large with more exhibits than you can count. Each aquarium is pristine. You will never worry about how the fish are cared for here. They have huge spaces and the aquarium employees some of the best conservationists. The aquarium is family friendly and handicapped friendly. If you are wheel chair bound, just let them know when you pull into park and they will direct you.There is a fee, but it is worth it. It is open 7 days and week in the daytime.The location is beautiful. Enjoy."
338,2019-03-11,5,Very good experience! Although it can be a bit crowded and expensive Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great place to learn about marine life and have a fun time. There are a few tours that you can buy separately and I was able to go to the Sea Otter Conservation Tour. The tour guide showed us all the otters and their little pups they foster every year! The other tour I was able to attend was the Jellies and Open Sea Tour. This tour was very interactive and showed us all the behind the scenes! Monterey is a great place to do and I highly recommend going there at least once in your life!
339,2017-05-05,5,"The best aquarium I have been to yet.  I remember being a child and whenever we would come to visit my family up North we would take the one hour drive to Monterey Bay.  I had only been to the aquarium once before and as a child everything seems so much bigger but let me tell you this aquarium is great for both the little ones and grown ups as well. One cool fact is that the aquarium has been opened since 1984 a very cool year. Pricing varies but the important thing to know is that the money you spend at the aquarium is for this non profit run aquarium and I think that is a good cause. They do have member specials and if I lived near the area I would totally become a member. Student discounts rock!  So, thank you Monterey Bay Aquarium from this college student on a budget.  The various exhibit rooms will take your breath away.  Make your first stop at the Kelp Forest and slowly start to feel your body swaying away with the current you are watching. My favorite was the open sea. I am not going to say what it look like for purposes of not ruining the first time experience for whom ever is reading my review.  Just go and be amazedFor the children the touch center is fantastic.  I can not wait to have some little ones so we can come visit Monterey Bay Aquarium and make some wonderful memories."
340,2019-07-26,5,"What a great experience! All of the exhibits are well curated, informative, visually stunning. It's clear that conservation and education are the primary goals of the aquarium all while taking great care of the species housed here. The entire aquarium was clean and well maintained and really does provide fun for all ages. As a new mom a huge bonus for me was the beautiful and luxurious nursing lounge. I haven't seen anything like before and really appreciate it (we went to the zoo the day before and I had to feed my daughter on a bench while groups of day campers walked by. To say this was ""better"" would be a supreme understatement). More places need to take inspiration the Monterey Bay Aquarium as it's the gold standard ."
341,2019-09-12,5,I love this place and grew up coming here! This is a greatplace for children and adults and families
342,2019-12-03,5,"The aquarium is a must if you are traveling to Monterey. We are currently sitting the cafe after about 2 hours of looking through exhibits with still more to go! I would also like to say that All the staff is lovely, but Betsy was so kind and sweet to us. She was great! 5 star service and 5 stars for the aquarium! Thank you again!"
343,2017-04-30,4,"I haven't been here since I was in elementary school and it was sort of cool to come back as an adult years later.My partner and I are celebrating our anniversary with a weekend in Monterey and Carmel and started our weekend off here. He purchased tickets ahead of time and it was pretty easy getting in (members/will call line) at 11 on a Saturday.Parking: $15 in a lot a few blocks away. There were no spots in the closest lot and no street parking but the area is walkable and there are parking options within walking distance.Tickets: EXPENSIVE. $50 for adults?!? I thought this was pretty crazy given the size of the aquarium and exhibits. I felt it was maybe worth around $30-35 max.In terms of the exhibits, they were well done for sure though some more than others. The open oceans and jellies were really cool. Was hoping that the otter section would be bigger. The kelp forest was really cool too. The touch pools were too crowded so we didn't get to really see what was available there. Schools of fish were really well done and I liked that the information was simple/accessible. We enjoyed the 15 min Luna the otter film we saw in the auditorium-nice way to start the day.The aquarium was really crowded especially towards the end of our visit. Maybe they can do some crowd control or flow control? Note to couples/adults visiting: I've never seen so many kids in my life. Watch where you step since you're likely to bump into the under 3ft set or a stroller. If they had adults-only days, I'd be all over that (yes, I'm that childless millennial wanting child-free spaces). Once I have kids, I'm sure I'll appreciate how kid-friendly this place is ;)On a sunny day, the outdoor spaces provide for great photo ops. Must-do while in Monterey but note the cost and maybe consider membership if you live nearby. Go really early to avoid crowds or see if they have any adults-only evening events."
344,2018-06-15,5,My wife and I took our 4 year old daughter and we all had a blast!i would recommend 3-5 hours because there is so much to see and do. Great place to take family pictures. Very kid friendly place! Take snacks because youll be there a while and time goes fast as your looking at everything. They have a place you can eat at an ok price. Gift shops if youd like to pick something up. Itll be the best aquarium youll see!
345,2018-10-09,5,"Love the exhibits! It's a giant aquarium with interactive sights. There are a lot of petting at this aquarium, mostly with sting rays and starfish and such. I grew up coming to this place and it's a goodie but an oldie. I visit seldomly but when I do, it's a nice place to walk around and explore. Also the city around it is pretty nice too! A lot of tourist attractions"
346,2018-10-28,2,"An absolutely FANTASTIC place to visit!An absolutely OVER-PRICED entry fee.. and, wow, the cost of membership is sky-high, too.How can people enjoy the Aquarium with such an inflated entry fee?I don't even know if they offer ""Free Tuesdays"" to us locals anymore? Regardless, just waaaaaay waaaaaay too expensive to enjoy on a regular basis!, which is sad for those of us who actually live here."
347,2018-04-22,5,Fantastic day of fun for little ones!There is a lot to see and you can easily cover the whole aquarium in a day. I downloaded the free app to help with all the zones to be covered but you're given a map on entry which serves the same purpose. Bags are checked on entry to the aquarium. The queue to purchase tickets move quickly. The cafe is packed at lunchtime and it's better to walk outside to grab a bite to eat. Remember to wrap your hands before you exit. The stamps are placed by the exit. Pretty pricey at $50 per adult. Kids under 3 are free. I'm not sure where the best place to park would be. I parked at an outdoor parking lot for $20 per day.
348,2018-11-13,5,"I really want to give this place 10 stars, super exciting and interesting Aquarium, visit started off purchasing tickets from Tyrone at the ticket counter. Not just someone to take your money and rush you on your way, he took the time to point out the next couple of events, Otter Feeding and Kelp Forest feeding schedules and point out the locations on the map for us, super friendly guy who wants to make sure the guests have a great time. One the place is huge and there is lots of walking so it is a several hour outing not something to rush though in an hour or less plan accordingly, however you can come and go thought the day with a handstamp and your receipt so if you need to go out and rest for a bit they make it easy. Otters and the kelp forest are the stars of the facility, there is so much to see that you just become immersed in the experience. There are many volunteers spaced throughout the Aquarium that you don't have to search very much to find a knowledgeable person if you have a question.Be sure to catch one (or all) of the movies in the theater, they are narrated by a real live person who sticks around after the show to answer any questions you might have. Great place to spend the day and learn about sea life and see some outstanding exhibits."
349,2019-09-01,5,I've taken my kids here 3 times now and they absolutely love it. I love all of the hands on learning provided to them has increased their interest and love for the ocean and everything in it. The only suggestion I have is adding more sharks to the open ocean exhibit.  I seem to remember that when I was a kids they had a lot more. But most of all they do amazing things for animals sick or injured and release them back into their original habitat!!!
350,2018-05-04,5,"I hadn't been here in years, and so much has changed with this aquarium and all for the better. We came here mid-week and it wasn't packed at all, you had enough space to walk around and not be shoulder to shoulder with people. They had this exotic bird that they were showing and you were allowed to take pictures of it, and then the exhibit where they fed the  seals, that was super cute, and people did show up for that, so if you know the feeding time, go early and get a good window spot. It was a lot bigger than I remember it being. and I did like the touch and feel exhibits too, when my little one gets a little older I would love to bring him back here, and even the snorkeling part on the private ocean space, that has to be new, because i don't remember that and it's an awesome experience! Totally coming here again!"
351,2019-08-03,4,"First time visiting this facility. It was awesome, not exactly what I expected but there were SO many people. So many RUDE people that the experience was almost unpleasant. (Visitors, not employees.) The otters were super cute when they were eating. The big octopus was rad! I would recommend trying to go early in the morning right when they open, maybe less people!"
352,2017-04-09,5,"I have to say, I've been to a fair share of aquariums, zoos and all of that. I love all types of animals, including sea creatures. This is my second time here and it is still probably one of the best aquariums I've been to. If not, maybe even the best. In terms of variety, exotic creatures and design, this place definitely has won. The very first amazing show is the big feed at 11am at the big open tank. Everyone always rushes to get ""good seats"" there. It's so nice to see everyone sitting on the floor at the lower level in such a calming, dark space waiting for the action to begin. Upstairs, they have some benches. Then the feed begins and it's just so amazing when you see the school of sardines swim and swirl around that huge tank. Their other exhibits are amazing as well. I mean, their jellyfish exhibit is amazing. I love wandering and getting lost in that dark, glowing beauty. So beautiful and calming! The octopuses are really cool! I love how family and kid/baby friendly this place is! They have an area for touching stingrays. Last time I was still able to touch them years ago and now they hide out by the wall. I think the stingrays are kind of tired of being touched so much lol. This time, nobody was able to reach their hands back there. There are so many cool interactive learning stations for children! Endless learning opportunities here!I think the one thing that really impressed me was how much they cater to nursing mothers. They dedicated a nursing room upstairs on the 2nd floor with 3 rocking chairs with foot stools AND a divider between each seat for privacy. There's a screen inside playing fishes that are swimming and the room has relaxing/soothing music. They even have a sink and bottle warmer in the room! Then again, another great place to nurse is right in front of the open tank since it's dark, quiet and calm. Nobody will even notice :)I also love how much outdoor space this place has. You can grab lunch and sit outside in the sun on benches and bleachers, sun bathe a bit. They offer binoculars outside because often, you can spot sea otters, seals, and birds out in the ocean. Today, we  saw the cutest sea otter having his big crab for lunch. We got so lucky to witness that pretty close! Also saw seals hanging out on the buoy. There are gift shops in the aquarium and outside as well. They have their own cafe, but there's also so many places to eat right outside the aquarium. Many outdoor and indoor spots. Just get a stamp on your hand to come back in :) This place is just so much fun and it's nice to follow their itinerary for all the feeds! You learn so much and there's just so much to see. If you want a great time with your loved ones, definitely come here. Tickets are expensive, about $50 per adult, but just think about how much that money they will use to maintain this amazing place. Take it as charity and in return, they are giving you and your loved ones a great time, which is always priceless :)"
353,2019-11-30,5,Your student card will get you a discount to this amazing place! Loads of fun! Felt totally like a kid again! :) Good info videos too! Do plan to spend at least 4 -5 hours here
354,2019-01-30,5,Had a great time with my family. Really enjoyed seeing the octopus and otters. The penguins not so much but that is personal beef between me and the penguin species. :)
355,2018-10-11,4,"Great touristy place! The facility is really clean, very well maintained. The entrance fee isn't bad for how much there is to see! My husband & I came to check them out on our anniversary trip, we don't have kids. This place is definitely a kid place. They were kids running around EVERYWHERE. It gets annoying when you're trying to enjoy/ learn as well ;) We gave priority to the families with kids, and ended up waiting SO long to see the things we were interested in. We recommend attending when there are not a ton of kids around. Maybe early mornings or after 3pm? Hopefully you have a great experience here."
356,2019-05-22,5,Such a great aquarium in a wonderful part of the world.  Very knowledgeable staff and some of the most spectacular displays I have seen at an aquarium.  Great for kids and adults but it gets very busy and can get quite loud when there are school groups visiting.
357,2017-07-17,5,"Best place ever. Incredible attraction in Monterey Bay with incredible execution. Not only do they have a lot of staff walking around and posted at various areas, the staff are knowledgeable about what you might ask them. They care about the details too, they had binoculars for visitors out on the splash zone deck that were very nice to use to spot sea otters and sea lions out in the bay. Favorite exhibit was the kelp forest and open ocean. Those along with the otters were great. Definitely try to see some feedings and events such as the albatross talk or the productions in the theater. Very informative and interesting about marine life just outside the aquarium. Quality place to spend a quality day. You could probably get it done in 3 to 4 hours with seeing every exhibit (you wouldn't be able to hit a lot of the events that go on throughout the day). With kids you probably want to spend a little more time. They do a lot to cater to the little ones."
358,2019-05-20,5,"I hadn't been to the aquarium in years and today we went in and ended up buying the student year pass which is 75$ and since a single day pass for students is 40$, it will definitely be worth its value after just 1 more visit! The aquarium was clean and staff was all over the place! Just looking into the tanks and one woman came over and showed us a baby version of the bass we were admiring. It's so great to go into a place like this where the workers and volunteers are passionate about their jobs. A lovely environment and I cannot wait to return again soon."
359,2019-08-11,5,Fun day for both adults and kids. Thx. You guys are a Bay area treasure. I wish had visited sooner.
360,2017-09-04,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) is a non-profit public aquarium located in Monterey, California, United States. The aquarium was founded in 1984 and is located on the site of a former sardine cannery on Cannery Row. It has an annual attendance of around two million visitors. We've been here several times but still fond of this aquarium. I wish the cost was a little lower. My kids loved it.  I'll recommend this place to everyone with or without kids. It's a educational and fun place for all the ages."
361,2019-02-17,5,"I though it was kind of expensive at first, but then I learned that more then half f the proceeds go to helping marine life so heck yeah I'll pay 50 bucks to see Nemo! My favorite exhibit was the open ocean. It was so relaxing I could have sat there forever!"
362,2019-11-25,4,Clean and wide availability of staff to answer questions. A bit on the expensive spectrum but they truly help the marine wildlife.
363,2018-12-31,5,"Great family experience! Educational for the whole family and the kids enjoyed getting their hands wet in the various pools.  Parked in a nearby garage for $15, arrived at 10 am and there was plenty of parking on a holiday. The cafeteria at the aquarium had good options, but got too busy so we got a hand-stamp to exit and eat an amazing bowl of clam chowder Louie's. Re-entry was fast and easy to finish our visit of the exhibits."
364,2018-11-27,5,"The aquarium is a great spot to take the family, they have everything for people of all ages. The site is up to date and offers a wide variety of marine life to view. Be sure to check out all the exhibits as many have been upgraded. Fish, penguins, sharks, eels, jellyfish, etc. they have it all! There is also a restaurant and cafe for those that get hungry during their visit."
365,2019-08-18,5,"Absolutely love this little gem on the bay! Friendly,  helpful and knowledgeable staff.  I really enjoy spending time at the aquarium.  So much to see and very educational."
366,2018-04-05,4,"Yes, it is great! It is Worth the money. So the negatives are that there is no good parking. I paid 26 to park. I did the museum in 3 hours. It was just me and my 8 month old so I had a bit to juggle but it was great and even an area for babies. She was more interested than I thought she would be. The whole experience besides the parking was pretty cool. If I didn't have a baby and stroller I would have parked further out, but with a stroller, everything is more difficult. It was a really fun day!"
367,2019-01-29,5,"Brought my girlfriend on a date here and we had such a good time watching the hammer head shark , sea turtle swim was super relaxing. Came on a week day still gets pretty packed but it was enjoyable. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is huge it took us all day to explore. It's kinda pricey but they had a student discount which was a plus."
368,2019-08-17,5,"Great place, great staff. Could spend all day wondering this amazing destination. The price is a bit steep but when you think where the money is going it's all okay. A must see of Monterey Bay."
369,2019-05-07,5,"We always spend a few hours here when we come up to Monterey.  The exhibits are great, the facilities are clean, and the docents/volunteers are always helpful and knowledgeable."
370,2017-08-09,5,"The last time we visited this was 30 some years ago and it's still the best one that I've been to. The exhibits are great and the staff very welcoming.For a Wednesday, this place was packed with tourists and school kids."
371,2019-07-27,5,There were a lot of kids running around unattended by their parents. The place was a bit noisy due to the fact that there were a lot of kids running around. Now... besides the kids? This place is awesome! I have taken a lot of photos inside and the aesthetics and how marine life is presented is just so breathtaking. I would definitely come back.
372,2019-08-10,5,An amazing facility and experience both for adults and kids. You can tell the staff are both educated and in the mindset to have a positive experience for all those that attend. Amazing attractions and facilities and is a must do when in town. The ticket price is steep but you will see why once you enter the lobby! From the very young to old it is amazing!
373,2018-12-30,5,"The very best aquarium in the entire world.  Can't say enough about the amazing exhibits that bring the ocean right to you. It's expensive but worth it. Go early and be sure to see the otter, ocean reef and penguin feedings. Get there early to get a good view.  Don't miss the small exhibits where tide pool life, jellyfish and octopus will amaze you."
374,2017-08-01,5,"Expensive for adult general entry, but hands down the finest aquarium I've visited. Plenty of activities for adults and kids alike- this is a full day event.Will be back!!"
375,2019-01-08,5,"No kids, just act like kids in my 70'sMy greatest joy was TOUCHING the rays AND of all, standing on the side as all the penguins come down the narrow walking lane!I wanted to jump in the lane and join them!Young or OLD as in YOUNG at heart, there is nothing that can compare to seeing all these 'beauties' as Steve Irwin would say.GO and be at one with all of natures creatures!"
376,2017-03-07,5,"It's all been said already.....so anything I try to write seems null and void.Its a slightly pricey attraction that brings all walks of life to celebrate all that is the Monterey Bay and the sea. Everything is family friendly and the kids will have a blast.Touch the slimy, gooey stuff. See the bright and vibrant fish and stuff. Learn about serious topics regarding our water and the ocean. See some cool stuff, art too. Its never a bad idea to be aware or educate yourself, right?!Buy all the logo'd merch and all the cute stuffed animals -- they have plenty of stores conveniently set around the facility. I ended up taking a sea horse ornament home, it was either that or a mug -- and we're out of cupboard space ;)There was also a cafe, but we ate before we came, so I cannot comment on that.Seriously though, its worth the investment to walk around and experience it all. Even if its your fifth time in a few years. Maybe I'm more of a sea gal than most, but I enjoy every time I get a chance to get in there. The quotes all around the facility and the gorgeous views of what we'd normally not be privy to as mere mortals, it's ALL worth the $50ish price tag.Pro-Tip: See if your work offers a discounted ticket into the museum. Many do, so be sure to try that before you spend full price.If you don't like this place, you have no Sole!"
377,2019-07-23,5,Wow this place is nuts! Highly recommend. We took our 2 and 4 year old and they loved it. Super cool. Kinda expensive but other than that it was amazing.
378,2017-03-28,5,Best aquarium I've ever been to in my life. We came on our honeymoon to sf.. and we're in Monterey bay for work for my husband we had the afternoon to kill so we went to the aquarium!! Omg we even got a behind the scenes tour..This aquarium is huge full of so many different animals and creatures of the sea from all over the world!!!!!So many touch pools so many different kinds of jellys starfish. Omg I want to go back it was the best day ever.I loved the behind the scenes tour we got to see how huge all the tanks were and how the workers here really take pride in the animals. I would love to take our kids here to experience how amazing this aquarium really is!!!!!
379,2018-04-09,3,"My wonderful co-worker gave me passes to see the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  There were lots of exhibitions and lovely music to accompany each one.   I especially loved the puffins and the jelly fish.  The only complaints about this place is the restaurant and food.  I purchased a strawberry cheesecake that tasted like jello and a coffee that was too bitter for my husband.  He wouldn't consume it.  I didn't know that there was a restaurant inside the aquarium but found out the hard way when I tried to sit down with the cheesecake from the Cafe. A man screamed, ""Mam, you cannot sit here. It's for the restaurant!""  I thought that was rude since there was no signage that I could see.  A sign hung very high above my head.  Why don't they just put a standing sign there instead of wailing at Cafe customers?  Furthermore, I would have been happy to have dined at the restaurant if I had known that it existed.  There was no signs or information/marketing anywhere in the Cafe about the Monterey Bay Aquarium restaurant.  Suffice to say, this screaming interfered with my enjoyment of the Aquarium.   If I ever went back, I would just go straight to the restaurant because they seem to treat their customers better and treat everyone else like trash."
380,2018-11-15,5,Came in a Sunday so it was so packed! But I didn't mind cause there was so much things to do. I love going to all the different exhibits but my favorite was the jelly fish one. I learned so much just visiting here for a few hours. Should definitely visit here if you get a chance!
381,2019-11-18,5,"Kudos to a truly world class aquarium! The exhibits are extremely well conceived and spotless with attention to the smallest detail. Descriptions are clear and concise with wonderful photography, text and graphics. The facility is spotless and well maintained and, most importantly, all of the animals seem healthy and thriving. The guides and interpreters are all extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Congrats MBA! Keep up the great work."
382,2019-08-04,5,"Had such an amazing experience but 5 stars is for Kirt who went out of his way to assist me. I could not pull up my tickets because they were sent to a work email. I was annoyed and anxious due to us celebrating my fiancé's birthday, we drove from San Francisco and we were already behind schedule. However, Kirt who's the manager went out of his way to help us get in before closing time as my manager tried to send the email to me. Kirt and his staff went out of their way to make sure that my fiancé had the best experience for her birthday, we finally got the tickets sent to my personal email thanks to Kirt and staff."
383,2019-07-18,5,"This is an astounding aquarium. The prices may be exuberant, but inside, there are a variety of breathtaking exhibits and shows, including sea otters and the History of the Monterey Bay!While we were there, they had two special exhibits, Tentacles and Viva Baja!. Tentacles was one of my favorites, because it offered close-up views of those cephalopods that encapture so many people.Another of my favorite exhibits was the Jellies exhibit; they are truly magnificent creatures. It was simply heartstopping to see the bands of color and of bright white luminescence in the water.The in-aquarium restaurant/cafe was rather overpriced, but the food was reasonable. In short, this aquarium has everything. Penguins, otters, jellies, octopuses, seabirds, fish, turtles, or anemones, they have it all. They even have a small history of the building itself, from its time as Hovden Cannery to the current workings of the aquarium."
384,2018-11-29,5,"This is a great Aquarium for both kids and adults. Both the admission and cafe are pricey but are well worth it. The cleanliness and quality of the interior are quite good, sort of like the Getty in LA but if the Getty started from a reasonable budget.It's best to go during an off-time, as when it gets busy it is truly packed just like a Disney park. Unlike other aquariums, there are no live dolphin or other animal shows. The closest they have to that is watching them feed the animals and fish behind glass.All the shows I've seen in their movie theater have been of the slide show type where photos and short videos are projected while an employee narrates. All of those have been quite good, especially the sea otter rescue show."
385,2019-08-02,5,Great place to take your family and friends lots of science and nature with many things to visit and memorable experiences.
386,2019-04-10,4,This place was awesome. Beautiful displays and wonderful learning environment. Spent the whole day here with no problem. They had something going on almost all day.  The only reason I didn't give the aquarium give stars is because it is kind of expensive. They don't even have military or veteran tickets. Will go back though.
387,2018-06-06,5,"How could anyone have one negative thing to say about the aquarium. I have been coming to the aquarium for over 30 years and have watched it grow and expand. I am never let down by the aquarium and the wonders of the sea it provides for you to see. The exhibits are great for all ages there are interactive areas for kids to really learn about the sea and its environment. You are able to see creatures from the deep which most people would never be able to see. The education you receive from the exhibits is phenomenal. Each time I have gone there has been a different main exhibit, but there are some staples also which turn into friends you haven't seen in awhile. Like the California Sheepshead a staple at the aquarium, but amazing nonetheless. I highly recommend the aquarium for all visitors to the area. Who could talk about the aquarium within mentioning the otters. They are lively, relaxing to watch, fun, exciting and my number one most favorite animal to see at the aquarium."
388,2019-01-12,5,"Been here multiple times so I knew what to expect but it was my boyfriends first time and he loved it! I've always gone during the summer, which is a busy time of year. But January was the perfect time to go. It wasn't busy or too crowded at all. Seemed very well kept and clean. The sharks were super cool to look at. The jellyfish exhibit is beautiful and my favorite. It's big with lots to look at so you're able to spend a couple hours in there. Although it was a bit pricy. Almost $100 for 2 tickets even with the student discount but the student discount is appreciated."
389,2018-11-26,5,"This place has is amazing. High quality exhibits. Gift shops and outdoor balconies that look over Monterey bay. Lots of animal life in the bay. Dolphins, whales, birds and sea lions are a few that live in the area. This is located in a walkable neighborhood with street parking."
390,2018-02-05,5,"I absolutely love aquariums and this one takes the cake.  I've now been to Monterey twice and was seriously bummed that I didn't have hours to kill on my visit last summer to do this place justice.  I'm so glad I was able to come back last week and spend about 4 hours here exploring and taking my time with my husband.  It is pretty expensive at $50 a person full-price.  But it's worth it.  It's a beautiful aquarium and I'm sure it's not cheap to maintain it in all its glory.I really loved the Kelp Forest with the anchovies swimming and glittering in the sunlight.  All the other fish and the kelp are gorgeous and the giant two-story windows inside allow for you to take the entire scene in from afar.  Feeding is neat in this area so if you are nearby when feeding time is happening make sure to stop and see it. Of course I loved the cute little playful otters and spent a LONG time taking photos of them and watching them swim back and forth.  One played with a ball and the others seemed to really be enjoying the attention at the windows - they kept swimming past and touching the glass with their little paws.  So adorable.  Really really cute. The splash zone was great for kids and really allows you to get a hands-on experience.  There are two areas where you can do this inside the aquarium and one is by an open-air section with birds that was really cool. This aquarium had a ton of up-close exhibits where you could really get in and see the fish and sea creatures.  It was beautiful and it was large and took a really long time to walk around.  They had several interactive areas for kids (and adults) to learn something about the local area and sea life in general.  I really liked the deep sea exhibit and the large, dark deep sea tank with turtles and other sea animals swimming inside.  It was very calming and beautiful. The outdoor terrace overlooking the water and the tide pools built into the aquarium are pretty beautiful with views of the Pacific Ocean. The gift shop and dining options here were the best I've seen at any aquarium - lots of healthy options, a bakery with fresh goods, and daily specials.  It looked like it actually tasted pretty good which is rare for aquarium food honestly I think. The Cannery Row exhibit at the entrance was neat to learn about the rise and fall of the canned fish rush during war times.  I learned some things I definitely didn't know and it was neat to get some context on the rise of Cannery Row and fishing in general in the Monterey Bay area which has been pretty prominent there (duh it's perfect for it) since the 1800's. Love love love - I'd heard this was a must-see in the area but I'm so glad I was able to finally find out for myself!"
391,2019-03-03,5,We went their with our extended family even though it's little on the expensive side but it's all worth it. My toddler totally loved it it has quite a few spots within the aquarium designed just for kids so if your kid is getting bored or tired just take them to one of these play areas and they will love it. The variety of sea animals they have is quite good. There are various information centers within the aquarium where you can gather lot of information if you are interested in learning more.
392,2017-07-07,4,"Seriously such a great place to go with your friends, on a date, or with the family and I know the cost can be a little intimidating, but it's totally worth it. We got through the whole aquarium in a couple of hours, and we didn't rush through anything. The exhibits are really well laid out and you don't feel claustrophobic even when the aquarium is full of people. From jellyfish to sharks to otters there is something for everyone. It's a great aquarium in a great location with a beautiful view of the surrounding ocean. It's clean and smells fresh (which isn't always the case with an aquarium). They have food and drinks in their food court and lots of space outside to just be outside. Catch a show if you need some time to chill and sit. Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must do!"
393,2018-02-20,5,"The Aquarium was everything I thought it would be! Here are just some pieces of advice:1. If you go on the weekend, arrive first thing in the morning! We are thankful we did that, as by the afternoon the place was swarming with strollers and screaming children. We were able to admire the exhibits and leave once it got really bad.2. DO NOT eat at the Café. Biggest rip off. Overpriced, small portioned, and mediocre. And good luck finding a seat. I understand paying a lot of money for a ticket and souvenirs, as this is a non-profit and the money goes to research and rescue. But the Café is just a terrible experience all around. They do stamp your hand so you can come back, so go get lunch somewhere else, or even better, bring your own to enjoy on the patio overlooking the bay."
394,2019-05-30,5,"Don't even think twice about checking this place out, it is worth every penny  You can literally come here 20+ times and still be in awe each time. It is pricey but it is an amazing experience. The aquarium has so many supportive programs for schools, students, teacher professional development, the community, etc."
395,2018-07-25,4,"The Aquarium is really big, you can spends hours in here and is worth the $50 admission fee; it's a good place to check out if you're really into marine life and creatures and if you're looking for something to do when you are in Monterey area.My favorite parts of the aquarium are the jelly fish and tanks where you can see the fishes, sharks, and sting rays etc. from the bottom, middle or above. They also have large area of touch pools that were fantastic cool and interactive, but remember to wash your hand afterwards!"
396,2018-11-28,5,This aquarium is amazing! I arrived early on a Saturday and made sure to buy my ticket ahead of time. We paid for parking nearby but there were other options along the streets as well. The instructions were easy to follow to get to the aquarium and the parking lot.We spent the entire day at the aquarium from open to close! You're able to exit and re-enter so we had a late lunch down on the pier. There are plenty of activities to do such as feedings and meet an greets with animals. We went to almost all of the feedings and personally loved the deep ocean and kelp forest feedings. You can really tell that the staff are passionate about the animals and are friendly with everyone.
397,2019-01-21,3,"This aquarium is the absolute best!! We love it here and come whenever we can.However...the cafe is awful!! We thought it would be fun to just eat lunch there. We went in knowing that it was going to be expensive but we expected a lot more than what we got. My pizza was cold and flavorless (the crust tasted like tap water...weird right?!) and my husbands poke bowl was so inedible that even my brother in law, who will eat literally anything, could not stomach it. If they are going to charge so much they really need to work on the quality of their food."
398,2019-07-08,5,"Great place to go in Monterey.  Seeing marine nature life in all its splendor.  The themed exhibit downstairs changes every so often, been pretty cool so far (been here many times).  Great for kids and family or even by yourself (my favorite so I can take my time).  The films in the theatre are okay..  I'd spend more time looking at the exhibits.  be sure to take water and some snacks, dress in layers and a light jacket and comfortable shoes.  Overall a nice experience.  A must see in Monterey."
399,2019-01-05,5,"This Aquarium is So Beautiful. I am going to tell you about my favorite Exhibits at this Aquarium and show you photos. I enjoyed my time here and I will definitely be returning. The Aquarium Employees were very pleasant and friendly. They were also very knowledgable. My First Favorite was the Largest Octopus that I have ever seen, The Giant Pacific Octopus. I was very concerned though because it seemed like the area that he was in was very small and some people failed to turn their flash off of their camera when taking pictures of It and I felt bad about that. It was Incredible to look at though and I was very amazed. Hopefully at the end of the night, The Octopus is moved into a more spacious tank? (Being Optimistic)My Second and Last Favorite Exhibit was the Jellyfish. It was so satisfying to watch them move. It was surprisingly a very calming moment and I loved every second of it.This Is also a great place for kids, they have more than 1 area where small toddlers can play . The areas are Indoor and only one of the areas are closed in by a gate so you won't have to worry about your little one getting out of your sight. There Is also a small water area behind the gate so you should bring an extra pair of socks for your toddler.I also enjoyed seeing the Stingray, The ""Finding Nemo Fish"", The Turtle, and The School Of Fish. All Very Cool. This is a Perfect Place For Kids, They had a blast!Aquarium Cons: Aside from The Octopus and The Jellyfish , I was expecting to be wowed by more but that was it. I am also concerned about the size of the tank that the Octopus was in and If It really gets to stretch out in a bigger space."
400,2019-03-13,3,"Checking in was kind of a hassle for no reason. Bought the tix online, had the voucher on my phone..expected them to just scan my phone and keep it pushing but we had to email voucher to their   willcall email so they can print it out. I had zero service in there and emailed them yet it took forever to go through and once it did the pic of the voucher was blurry! She couldn't accept it of course. Had my boyfriend email them and it came out clear. It took literally 20 mins to get in. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Aquarium was ok, geared more for the kids. Also this is trump country, so if you have a hint of brown in your skin, be prepared because people stare."
401,2019-07-21,5,"Just spent the morning at the aquarium. It was a fantastic experience. There were helpful, friendly and knowledgable staff everywhere! The place was very clean and well maintained. We loved the short movies that were narrated by a human...wow!! I appreciated their commitment to ocean conservation. Only downer was waiting for the otter feeding with the adults standing in the front. Very crowded and hot...not sure how to do better crowd control...it was needed. Overall, well worth the price of admission."
402,2019-07-21,5,"Amazing! I've been here many times before, and it seems like there is always something new to explore. The tours, especially the Sea Otter Conservation Tour, are well done, and the tour guides are fun to listen to and learn from. All in all, every time I've been here has been great!"
403,2019-06-20,3,"It's always extremely crowded, but there is a ton to see and experience for everyone! It's a little on the pricey side, but if you plan on coming often, I heard it's worth it to get the pass and even have your own separate exit. They have more than just marine life and love the work that they do!"
404,2017-02-17,5,"Amazing aquarium,  one of the most beautiful aquariums i have seen.  They have sharks and giant jelly fish , cute otters and penguins all under one roof and many more to list.  The aquarium Is two stories and very very busy.  The outside of the aquarium was beautiful. The price was worth the 2 hours I spent. They had a lot of places to buy souvenirs,  food,  drinks and snacks. I went on a weekend and it was extremely packed with kids,  at times it was a little hard to get through some exhibits.  Overall the experience was amazing and worthwhile,  once you finish there to can walk the town which has amazing shops and restaurants to eat at or stroll thru the fisherman dwarfs place for fishing and surfing."
405,2016-12-26,5,"Everyone should make it a point to visit Monterey Bay Aquarium at least once in their life! I'm so happy I finally had the chance to visit this amazing place. Once you walk in you will be overwhelmed and not know where to start. Me and my son headed straight to doors that lead us outside with a breathtaking view of the ocean. Sure you've seen one ocean you've seen them all right? Well if you haven't seen this one then you're in for a treat! The view around this whole facility is priceless. We spotted sea otters out in the ocean, which I've never seen before. They are the most adorable marine mammals! You can also see them up close inside the aquarium swimming around playing with each other. They are the cutest to watch.My favorite had to be the jelly fish exhibit. The variety of jellies they have on display is something I've never seen before. They are beautiful! Their colors are so vibrant and they are very photogenic sea creatures. This exhibit will have you mesmerized! There's so much to look at here and your little ones won't be bored. They also have a kids zone area where they can run around and burn off all that energy. I could write a book on this aquarium but overall my visit here was great and I highly recommend visiting Monterey Bay Aquarium if you haven't paid them a visit yet."
406,2019-07-01,5,Finally joined as members... Protect our oceans! Excited to take advantage of membership privileges.
407,2019-01-14,5,"This is why folks come here.  Top of the line.  Nothing to complain about. ALWAYS busy, but the exhibits change often.  I want my own sea otter!The docents are very knowledgeable and EAGER to help.While the gift shop is lovely, it is a bit pricey.  I've been here many times - sometimes just for a break in the day.  Allow time to absorb everything, although, I believe you can leave and return the same day."
408,2019-06-06,5,Behind the scenes tour was incredible. Christine was so knowledgeable and friendly. We got to PET a jelly fish.
409,2018-12-05,5,"I was lucky to go to the Aquarium for the first time during a private event in the evening on December 3rd. NO crowd at all! yay we had a buffet style dinner that was delicious, an adult beverage if we wanted (I have my drink ticket away) and plenty of time to tour the facility and see everything which I don't think I saw everything. Shortly after I ate dinner I had the ""itis"" and went back to the hotel on the first bus. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to the Aquarium."
410,2019-02-17,4,"This has been the place that I've been going to ever since I was a kid. I absolutely love the exhibits here since there's a myriad of different species. My favorite is the moon jellies one since they're so pretty and glow in the dark. They also have a nice cafe, but it is pretty expensive because, well, it is food you are buying inside. The gift shops also have really cute Parking is hard to find here and the tickets can be expensive, but in my opinion, it is worth it. This place is also very clean and kid-friendly. :-)"
411,2018-03-30,4,"Just check this out for at least 2+ hours if you're new to the area. It's pricy but seeing the beautiful jellyfish in the bright, glowing, blue water tank makes the experience completely worth it. A lot of people say you need to spend many hours here but we didn't want to spend too much time. It's easily possible to speedrun through the aquarium if you don't stop to read everything. Look for the jellyfish, sea otters, penguins, and the deepsea tank. Those are the coolest and/or cutest in my opinion."
412,2017-01-07,5,"Monterey Bay has one of my favorite aquariums. The exhibits are really beautiful, the setting is amazing, and it's great for all ages. The kelp forest is really incredible, and you can view it from multiple floors! Make sure you catch a feeding at 11:30 or 4:00. The schooling fish and jellyfish are my favorite to watch--completely mesmerizing and relaxing. Walk outside on the balcony to see the bay, and if you look straight down, the water is incredibly clear and you might see a seal or something else swim by. There's a touch tank and a lot of interactive/educational exhibits, too--something for everyone. Only downside is that it's pretty pricey, so check for available discounts (AAA, etc.)."
413,2019-07-12,3,It's old-school kind of a classic avoid the crowds call and ask about the best times to come. allow time for parking My best tip is to familiarize yourself with the special feedings exhibits giving yourself plenty of time dress the kids in one bright color they're so easy to lose in the crowds and all the kids are running in every different direction. pick meeting places and bring snacks  allow yourself time to relax and enjoy the experience don't rush through it
414,2018-08-11,5,"We spent a day here on a spur of the moment. We hadn't been here in probably 10 years since my kids were little. Frankly, it was the price that was keeping me away. But we decided to splurge after I found $5 discount coupon on my AAA account. I was able to buy the tickets on my phone and show my phone to the clerk as I didn't have a printer. We arrived around noon and spent 5 1/2 hours wandering around. I think it must have expanded since I last went there as it seemed huge. I think we saw everything - at least we tried to. I would say it was worth the price of admission. The movies were very good and all the exhibits were wonderful. I loved all the outdoor spaces to sit in and look at the water. I loved watching the sea otters, penguins, and jelly fish. I could watch the jelly fish for hours. All of the fish and sharks in the huge tanks were fascinating. I took way too many pictures! What a wonderful place to tour around and I'm glad we did it. The place was super busy for a Thursday though. I wasn't expecting that. Next time I think I'd go when school is back in session."
415,2017-06-05,5,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed our trip to the aquarium. Thanks to our Airbnb hosts, they offered free guest passes so we definitely took advantage of that!It was a great time. Incredible technology to help you learn about the critters, etc. the hosts were entertaining and educating during the feeding, learning and hands-on portions throughout the afternoon.We enjoyed seeing the sea otters and penguins! Check those out. As well as the aquariums with the rare fish and awesome sharks!Worth the visit if you are in the area."
416,2018-04-18,3,"This was the 2nd time coming here. I remember coming here when I was a really little kid, and I thought this place was great. So now that I have a son who loves animals, I decided to take him here and I was not impressed. The price for admission was high and there wasn't that much to see. We've been to a lot of aquariums, and this one was all right. I think the one in Osaka is one of the better ones, and I might even think the Shark reef in Las Vegas might be even better than here. I wouldn't go out of my way to just go to the aquarium."
417,2018-03-13,5,"Visiting this aquarium was seriously one of the highlights of our amazing coastal trip. I was very surprised to see some of the negative reviews on here! We have a pretty awesome aquarium in Chicago, and I'm so glad we visited the Monterey Aquarium as it far surpasses the Shedd. We spent about 3 hours here on a rainy Monday morning. It was the perfect time to visit as there weren't tons of crowds, but it was still very busy. If you have kids, this is a really great place to visit. Plenty of things to see and do for the little ones. If I lived in the area, I would be a member for sure. I loved everything here, but the Jellyfish exhibit and the Octopus/squid/cephalopod area were the coolest experience. I easily took over 200 pictures here. Such beautiful and interesting creatures. Since it was pouring rain, we parked in a garage a couple of blocks away. But I noticed there was plenty of street parking as we walked to the aquarium. I'm sure on the weekends, it's nearly impossible to find street parking, but it's something to check out."
418,2018-04-23,4,"This is such a great place to take the kids and even for a nice date. The vibe here is amazing! The view on the balcony outside is so beautiful I can sit there all day. Every room is an "" awe moment "" and there are a lot of cute shops and restaurants surrounding the aquarium. If you have kids it's great because they have an area for small babies, toddlers and older kids which I thought was really nice.Absolutely adore this place"
419,2018-09-06,5,"Buying tickets in advance helped us skip the human blob out front. They're good for a year from date-of-purchase.We didn't go to any of the special shows or programs and still managed to spend 4 hours looking at everything. The exhibits are all brilliant and there are multiple octopi so if you're scared of not seeing and octopus, have no fear.There's areas of hands-on interactive cool stuff for kids to do in different sections, which was a nice way to mix things up. It would be rude to pick a favorite thing here. I liked the tidepool splashy bit, my dude loved the jellyfish, and the little dude spent almost 15 minutes mesmerized by a certain hermit crab in a non-crab exhibit.I've been told that there are better aquariums in the country. I have yet to see those. This, however, was money well spent."
420,2018-01-03,5,"Beautiful, educational and fun! We came here for the first time last week and had a great time. Some tips:- Arrive about 15/20 minutes before they open and score a parking spot in the small lot that's just up the hill. - Avoid ticketing line and buy tickets before you get there via their site or app. - Food is good but mostly full meals so be snack ready. - Have a gift shop strategy because this place has loads of them hidden like toddler meltdown land mines. We went with one stuffy at the END of her visit if she was a 'big girl' - bribery, always wins! Enjoy and say hello to my spirit animal for me when you're there, obvi the otter!"
421,2016-12-24,4,"I have not been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in over 8-10+ years with my husband when we took a road trip up the coast. But this past Monday, we were fortunate to go with my friend (whom has a family membership and can bring up to 2 guest per visit). The aquarium is just how I remembered it, being in the cannery row district (something out of one of my favorite' books by John Steinbeck) with an incredibly large fish tank. Something about the aquatic life is rather relaxing and soothing at times (but to be honest, I still think fish is food and not friends. Finding Nemo movie goers were be highly ashamed). When we arrived by the touch pool (I think it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor), this volunteer was provided some neat information about the animals in this particular section. This included the sea sponge. These sea creatures are a multi- cellular organism. If you were to somehow break down the sponge to a single cell, it can still survive on it's own. The brightly orange colored sponge that she pointed to, she said that it is actually a cluster of other sponge cells all clumped together. When such a large colony like that form, they each have a particular function. For example, the left side would be in charge of finding food and the top side would be in charge of harvesting waste (sponge animals are excellent bottom dwellers that have an incredible filter system), etc. A lot of the volunteers walking around (there really were a lot of volunteers on our previous visit) were very friendly and volunteered some interesting facts about each section that they were in. When I commented this one elderly woman (volunteer) of how knowledgeable she was about this particular section that we were in, she told me that all volunteers learn this before going out to help guests around the aquarium. But she told me because she was so fascinated about bottom dwellers in general, she looks up information on her own to expand her knowledge and shares that with aquarium guests. On this visit, I really enjoyed watching the penguins. It was really cute and fun to see them collecting rocks as they begin their nesting process. It was also funny to see a few of the penguins trying to pull and pick at this rubber tarp because they really wanted to add it to their home (this black piece was loose and should not have been). One funny thing that happened when I was here was that this particular penguin swam up to the glass where I was standing. As I moved my hand across the glass, he followed. He followed very closely and quickly as I moved my hand back and forth (a little too fast, which made him look like he was nodding his head no very quickly... yes, I know I am cruel). Anyways, I also enjoyed seeing the sea otters (the pups or dogs of the sea). They look so happy swimming around and around in their tank, playing with each other and so forth. We also were able to see the Baja California exhibit. It focused mostly on reptiles that can live in this particular climate (I'm afraid of reptiles so I sped through this exhibit whenever I saw a tarantula, a lizard, etc). Towards the end, the exhibit focused on recycling and reminding us to do our part to keep litter out of our oceans and think about sustainability. Overall, a genuine interesting and educational afternoon and am incredibly grateful that my friend offered to drive us from Saratoga (90 minute drive) and be her guests for the afternoon (I am really surprised that the price to get in here now is $49.95 (prior to tax) for adults and $39.95 (prior to tax) for students because it was significantly cheaper when we came 8-10 years ago (and at these high prices, I don't know if I would be willing to pay)."
422,2018-12-19,5,"We visit Monterey several times a year and always stop into the aquarium (sometimes multiple times per visit).  The staff is super friendly and always very helpful. The Tentacles display is amazing, I could spend all day watching the cuttlefish bloop around. The otter enclosure is pretty awesome too. I love watching them play in the 'hot tub'."
423,2019-03-26,5,"I really can't give this place any less than five stars because it does such important work for community awareness and preservation. I've gone here since I was a baby and everything always amazes me. I went here earlier today since we haven't been in the area since 2009. There seem to be more exhibits (so it felt a bit cluttered sometimes), and some of the rooms feel way darker than they used to be. Between the darkness of the rooms and the enormous crowds moving through the aquarium, it was hard to know where you were going. It was also hard for us to locate the elevators, even with the map. I still got to see some of my favorite parts - the octopi, the sunfish, the otters, the penguins...However, what I will say is this: when it's crowd time, y'all need manners. There was a lot of crying and yelling, and not all of it was from the little ones. I can excuse babies and kids because they are new at being people in a society - plus, they're super cute. Parents, I get you're stressed out, but please make sure you're watching everyone and ensure that your child doesn't get nearly decapitated by the automated doors. And in any case, it's nice to hear ""excuse me"" from adults (and VERY nice from kids - thank you, boy in the Baja exhibit!) That being said, I'm really disappointed by how some of the grown-ups carried themselves. A grown man with a backpack protruding at least 3 feet from him nearly knocked out my mother, who just had two hip replacements and was walking with a cane. I can assure you that the kelp forest exhibit is NOT worth stampeding over your fellow visitors - especially when my mom has to watch every step. So, if you go here, please don't be backpack guy. Just remember who's around you and be considerate."
424,2018-08-10,5,"Dedicating my 200th review to my absolute favorite place on Earth... Monterey Bay Aquarium :)Worth every single penny! Wow! Such a serene and exquisite place employed with volunteers who actually care and want to help you learn about the exhibit.Tips on Monterey Bay Aquarium:1. Talk to a volunteer - The volunteers here have so much knowledge and are so passionate about marine life it really makes the experience more educational and enriching.2. Get to the otter show experience FAST - We came 5 minutes prior to the experience and there were already all the windows were already crowded. I would recommend coming 10-15 minutes earlier to get a good view, or just do that with any exhibit.3. Come during weekdays - Even on a Tuesday there was a lot of people, I can't imagine how that would be during the weekends. You're here to see the animals, not to squeeze with other people.4. Hit every exhibit - There is something worth discovering at every exhibit and even if you just do a quick walk through. You can always come back for more.5. Bring your student ID - It's a $10 discount.6. Watch the open sea exhibit from the second floor, usually a little bit more quiet and romantic if you're on a date. Favorite exhibits:1. Open Waters - The feeding experience is okay as it is just raining food from the sky, but the sardines and anchovies are honestly the star. These school of fish were so vibrant and athletic bouncing across the room. I would recommend coming here in a less crowded time and just sitting down and watching the giant fish tank. Its so interesting watching all these different fish interact with each other, especially the sunfish :)2. Jellyfish - The types and number of jellyfish Monterey has is absolutely amazing. Also, the room is darker so it illuminates the entire exhibit, so beautiful and great for photos.3. Shrimp section - Kind of weird, but there are so many different types of unusual shrimp. I love reading the descriptions to learn about various shrimp behavior patterns.Monterey Bay Aquarium is such an amazing place! I really enjoyed my experience here. 100/10"
425,2018-11-16,5,The second best aquarium I have been to after Atlanta which is the largest in the world :) Spent about 2 hours walking around with my mom. The otter feeding is one of the main attractions that you definitely don't want to miss! They also have lots of species of jelly fish. Some I have never seen before that are awesome! Another major thing they are known for are the schools of sardines and anchovies that swim in schools. Definitely glad we did this on our trip to Monterey. It can get a bit hot in there so make sure to dress accordingly! You can step outside for a bit and see the beautiful bay if you need a breather which is nice! They also allow reentry.
426,2018-09-04,5,What a great location near the ocean. The sea life that reside in this aquarium are spectacular. Your first visit will have you excited to come back. We brought our whole family for the trip yesterday. My two year old enjoyed himself the most! He has been obsessed recently with sea animals & this was a big treat for him. We loved it!
427,2019-06-10,5,Awesome aquarium had a great time spending the day here! The jellyfish exhibit was our favorite.
428,2019-06-08,3,"It's not worth the $50. I wanted to see big marine mammals, but i guess the only way to see them in captivity is at Sea World, which is unethical (watch blackfish). The jellyfish exhibit and otters are pretty good, everything else is kind lackluster."
429,2018-03-21,4,I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Every time I go to the I feel like a little kid. I still remember field trips and visits with schools and friends and my parents. It's one of the most amazing marine resources in the United States and I think we're all really lucky to have it here on the California coast.I particularly love the little sea horses and the star fish! The tide pools were always my favorite when I was a kid because you were allowed to pick stuff up and touch things like sea slugs and star fish. It's a great experience that I will continue to go back to over and over again. The only downside of course is that it can be a little pricey and the drive is a ways away. But if you're in the area it's a great place to visit!
430,2019-11-02,4,"The aquarium is awesome! The food is so overpriced in the cafeteria, it's ridiculous. So expensive."
431,2018-08-12,5,"We had a blast. There's entertainment for every age group. They have accelerated tour for ppl on short time, too!!! Must go again. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable."
432,2019-06-23,5,"A wonderful place to visit and enjoy, whether alone, with children or with grown up friends! I've renewed my membership over and over for almost 20 years."
433,2018-12-31,5,"This is the most amazing place in the whole area.The Sea Horses are my favorite, So freaking cute!!!"
434,2018-03-17,5,"Absolutely amazing aquarium experience for kids and adults! The aquarium is located on cannery row in Monterey and the Parking is easy to find in the city lots. We spent 4 hours checking out all the exhibits, especially the feeding times for the kelp forest, penguins and the sea otters! The touch pools were excellent and the kids really enjoyed learning about all the sea life. We had lunch in the cafe and though it was pricey, the soup, salad and pizza were excellent. This is a very interactive and hands on aquarium, truly a live ocean experience! Absolutely a must see if you are in Monterey."
435,2018-12-31,3,"otters, jellies, big crowds, long lines, high priced tickets, mediocre food, overpriced merchandise from China... what more could one ask for?Children of all ages will love it! lots to see, hear, feel, smell and taste in the beautiful pristine Monterey Bay!"
436,2018-05-03,3,It is too small for the price of a one time admission.  Any aquarium is amazing but it is is the Monterey bay aquarium right by the water i was excited. I loved the sea otters and the penguins but other than that i dis not find anything too exotic. Luckily we went when there were no crowds but i can imagine it could get crowded. There is a play area for the kids and a touch pool for them to feel the kelp.  That was a nice experience too.
437,2018-10-11,4,"The only thing I do not like is the amount of people present over a holiday weekend. This is a small aquarium and I actually got claustrophobic on Memorial Day weekend. I wish they had more classes on site also. I always enjoy the view from the back patio area. I would highly advise all to bring your own food! The cafeteria is hella busy and expensive. PB&J sammiches, fruit, water and some choco goes a long way while you're walking around. The jellyfish exhibit IS magnificent! Cheers!:)"
438,2016-11-12,4,"Well run aquarium with exhibits for all ages, incorporating digital media, hands on activities, live creatures and outdoor stages.Staff are efficient and cheerful. Today was a crowded long weekend room, and the line moved well. Do consider buying your tickets online to bypass the long line to purchase tickets. Lovely touch pools and closeup tide pools to look at the small stuff. So many exhibits, so little time. If I lived here we would buy season passes to vege in front of the mesmerizing displays."
439,2018-11-30,3,Always a nice visit there.. a but pricey but its expected.. the staff is always cracking jokes and being friendly... and of course they know a lot about environment..
440,2019-04-30,5,"Monterey Bay AquariumThe only aquarium I knew growing up was here in Monterey. We had a yearly membership for quite some time, and only cancelled because we stopped coming to Monterey so frequently. Whether I was legally a kid or unfortunately legally an adult, I have always felt like a kid here. The exhibits (some permanent like the otters, touch pools and jellyfish and the others that rotate in every so often) are so interactive alone. You always have staff around to answer questions as well as automated audio tours. One of my favorite areas to visit is outside looking into the pools and, OF COURSE, the wave window!! I've been to other aquariums through the years, but I guarantee nothing will top Monterey's. The interaction they provide for guests, but most importantly the environmental capacity they provide for the Monterey Bay and the ocean speaks volumes for their knowledge and love for what they do."
441,2018-08-25,5,"When looking for things to do in Monterey, the aquarium was repeatedly one of the top things on any list I saw. Going in, I wasn't too sure how much I would enjoy it. Most of the visitors were parents and their young children, and here my friend and I were, two mid-to-late twenties dudes on a Highway 1 road trip.This was hands down, one of my favorite things we did on our trip. The aquarium was very engaging, and the staff were very knowledgeable about the different animals on display. I got tons of great pictures and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Monterey."
442,2018-10-18,5,"We brought my daughter here for the first time yesterday and it was absolutely amazing! We were pleasantly surprised by the number and variety of fun exhibits they have. Our daughter is only 6 months old but loved looking at the colorful fish and watching the penguins and otters being fed. We had so much fun and plan to return many more times as she grows.Also, I have to mention how great it is that they have a clean, comfortable, peaceful nursing lounge AND gender neutral bathroom with a changing table. It made it so much easier for me to nurse my daughter and get her to nap and for my husband to change her. They definitely set the standard as I wish every place had these facilities to make families feel welcome. Great job, Monterey Bay Aquarium!!!"
443,2018-11-25,5,"Amazing, make sure to just buy a pass if you plan on going more than once!youtube.com/watch?v=M9VP…"
444,2019-06-10,5,"Prepare to be amazed at the dramatic One of the most comprehensive research, education and interactive display aquariums in the world. One of their jewels, centrally located is the giant glass encased kelp forest environment which is maintained and studied in an ongoing basis. The Monterey Bay Aquarium features a delightfully educational menu in the restaurant, educational studies of various time frames and intensity including wet suit diving in the adjacent protected ocean sanctuary, remarkably informative audio-visual presentations, special programs working with the local sea otters and other sea life, and a delightful gift shop full of unexpected treasures."
445,2017-11-18,5,"A truly must see stop if you're in Monterey! Yes it's a little expensive (get a coupon or discount if you can) and it can get crowded (try to go during off times during the week)... but it's very much worth the price of admission. The sheer amount of sea life here is impressive and the hourly shows are entertaining for kids and adults. Give yourself at least 5-6 hours here so you can see all the exhibits and catch most of the shows. You can go in and out of the aquarium if you want (grab lunch and come back). Make sure to show up at each show you want to go to at least 10 minutes early, since it can get very very crowded. Overall I very much enjoyed coming here and I'd highly recommend this place!"
446,2019-05-10,5,Our kids love this place! Okay... we do too. Lots to see here & great restaurants nearby. AND it's right on the beautiful bay Monterey!
447,2018-01-23,4,"Came to visit and all the workers were really friendly and accommodating. All the exhibits were really cool to look at. This place is very interactive and fun for kids and adults too. Learned a lot about the ocean, the animals living there and what we can do to help their environment. Also had nice views of the ocean outside. Gift shops were kind of over priced as expected. Crowds weren't too bad because we went on a weekday. Parking was excellent but got lucky because we found street parking right by the aquarium. Some parking lots were $15 which wasn't too bad because we were coming from SF area and parking lots over there can double in price. Also don't forget you can use your student or military discount :)"
448,2019-04-19,5,Love love love!!! My daughter is now aware of the environmental hazards and this little one has implemented a few interventions to keep the waters safe!
449,2019-05-06,5,"This aquarium never disappoints. We've been coming here since our children were babies and we always enjoy ourselves. We brought friends with us during our most recent visit. They had never been before and were very impressed with the layout. Compared to other aquariums we have visited, such as Atlanta, Monterey Bay is much more open and you feel as though you can spend time at each exhibit without feeling rushed to move out of someone's way."
450,2019-04-26,4,"Staff are great, the crowds are not. A bit expensive for what is offered. It's really a place for children more than anything. I enjoyed going, but spending more than an hour here would be tiresome."
451,2019-06-02,5,"The Monterey bay aquarium is one of the most different and beautiful places, if you are in Monterey need to know."
452,2018-06-26,3,"I wanted to come here because we were in Carmel for a wedding and the Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the largest aquariums in the world. My boyfriend and I had a good time and enjoyed all the exhibits and shows, but didn't think it was worth the $50 price tag especially when we have the Aquarium of the Pacific back home for half the price. We finished everything in about 2.5 hours. If you text the number advertised around the aquarium, you will get notifications throughout your visit of pop-up experiences that aren't on the schedule. We got to see some otters and an octopus getting fed which was cool.Overall a nice place to kill time if you're in the area and have the money to spend, but I don't think it's anything amazing for the price. Maybe better for families to enjoy with their kids."
453,2019-10-17,5,"What can I say but when visiting the peninsula, taking time to be at the aquarium on Cannery Row is the best place to enjoy rain or shine. Visitors have the view of the ocean both inside and out; to be taught/reminded of our teachings, to be a part of the people who support programs to help our sea creatures, we were glad to be able to see the exhibits, new and traditional. The little café had great choices. The gift shop was extraordinary, perfect for gifts, little and unique. If you're a member, there are great perks too--imagine having a sleepover (for kids and family) and doing games among the sea creatures. Certainly creative and clever--the aquarium is the place to spend quality time."
454,2018-07-16,1,"I could not believe that I paid about $50 to visit this aquarium that took me less than 1.5 hour to view the entire exhibit. I seriously do not understand the hype about this place. The jellyfish exhibit is nice, but that's about it."
455,2017-09-29,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is special to the family. We brought our kids here several times when they were younger and decided to visit again just recently. I was curious to see if MBA would still hold their intrigue now that they are teens. God bless this place, it did. Now I've been to other aquariums in San Diego and in Hawaii and really I have yet to see anything match the incredible exhibits and lay out of the MBA. They always have an incredible amount of specimens on display with some very exotic creatures. The two major highlights are the Kelp Forest Aquarium and the Open Sea Aquarium. Both are just jaw dropping in sheer size. The Kelp Forest has a rainbow of organisms to be fascinated by including a Giant Black Seabass, a Wolf Eel, and what looks like thousands of other fishes. Not to be outdone are the impressive ~40 feet high kelp beds. We sat in front of the Kelp Forest just gazing and letting ourselves be lulled to sleep by the sway of the current and one daughter leaned in and said ""I could just stare at this all day."" Don't mind admitting my eyes got a little teary. The Open Sea is not as colorful as the Kelp exhibit but is no less dynamic. How often can you see hundreds of sardines synchronize swim or watch Yellowfin tuna torpedo by or stare in wonder at a Giant Sunfish. I could go on and on so I'll just end by singing ""I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can."" Plan your trip at montereybayaquarium.org"
456,2018-03-08,4,This aquarium is huge and beautiful. Right next to the water and lots of exhibits. A little on the pricey side but the kids had a blast and that's all that matter. They have a variety of different animals and are very informative
457,2018-02-27,4,"Been coming here for over a decade and it always makes me so excited every time I come. I haven't been since middle school, until this past weekend February 24th to be exact. Not much has changed. I was disappointed because tickets cost so much. I was fortunate enough to obtain a pass from a friend so that made it possible to go. Would I pay $50?!?! no way. It is great for children, but because I've been here before, there's seriously nothing special.Came here on a Sunday and I have never seen so many people here in my entire lifetime. Thankfully my friend recommended going thru the side door and it saved me a lot of time not waiting in line. I did not go with any kids so it made wandering around from exhibit to exhibit a breeze. Got through the entire aquarium in an hour. Highlights: they have lots of feeding times. Employees are very educated. Lots of wondering volunteers who are helpful. Lots of hands on, and viewing deck on all floors.Will I be coming back soon? Nope. Probably not for another 5 years, unless I have kids or if I take my god son.Family Passes run from $250-$300 depending if you want to purchase a guest pass or not. (worth it if you have little kids who LOVE to go. It pays off if you go multiple times. )"
458,2018-10-29,5,Magic.All so beautiful. Everyone so delighted. Staff so helpful. One of the best things about Monterey.
459,2019-04-09,5,"I love this place, watch my awesome youtube video of this place! youtu.be/7zBFekDz_n4"
460,2018-10-01,5,I love this Aquarium and all that it has to offer. I have never seen a million gallon tank before and it's breathtaking. I think I spent four hours here and it went by quick. If you happen to be in Monterey Bay I highly recommend checking out this Aquarium.
461,2017-10-01,4,"I drove from Saratoga with my GF to visit for a Sunday. Was a pretty nice place to enjoy a relaxing afternoon. With that, you can bring food there and have a mini picnic if you do not want to spend a ton of money at the cafe.In terms of parking, you have options of parking on the street where you can py by hour (mind the various signs) but if you do not want to worry about your car, you can pay 10 or 15 bucks at the two different lots by the aquarium.The place is a bit pricey so we definitely wanted to make it worth it. We stayed for the better part of 4-5 hours. It is a smaller aquarium, but they have lots to read and learn from. If you have kids, there might not be too much to keep kids busy the whole afternoon, but people who are looking for a date spot, it is a nice place to relax. There are animal feedings that do get pretty crowded (specially the otter feeding) so you should plan to get to those 10-15 before the feeding starts. Other parts are pretty interactive which makes it a pretty fun place to relax.Overall a great place but a bit pricey and parking can be a pain."
462,2018-07-19,5,I love coming here and spending a day here. My favorite part are the jelly fish exhibits. I have not been there but friends me the Chicago aquarium is better which I have not been to but I have been to many others and this is the best.
463,2019-05-22,5,"Open to explore for over 35 yrs, and is evolving to make your visit a memorable event,  The Monterey Bay Aquarium  is for all ages, and is a nonprofit,  please go on TheMontereyBayAquarium.o… to get your tickets, plus see if there's a group discount."
464,2016-09-12,3,"Had a pleasant visit to the aquarium this past weekend...was pretty crowded and we were a little bit underwhelmed by the current wildlife and exhibits. A bit of advice:1) if you're a AAA member go to the office about 10 mins away and get discounted tickets. We saved a ton off the $50 per person to get in. 2) kids, kids, kids everywhere. watch out. and if you have little ones, please try to teach them to be courteous. try...maybe.3) Aquarium closes REALLY early. Like 5pm on a weekend early. We didn't know this and only had a couple hours to walk around as we thought getting there later would spell some of the crowds.4) Park at any one of the $10-$20 daily lots around the area and Cannery Row. Or if you're totally lucky you can snag a metered spot and save $.It was okay...I actually think the Baltimore Aquarium is larger and nicer...but it beats a lot of other local attractions. Kinda sad though for the animals....I hope they're somewhat happy and cared for well...but they don't belong in cages or on display. Kind of torn over what extend humans should keep animals for show or sport."
465,2018-02-26,4,"It's a little expensive, but you get to see the unique ocean creatures of the area. I highly recommend viewing the jelly fish and the otters, really cool to see! If you go outside on the balconies, you might even catch a view of an otter in the wild! Make sure you check the feeding times going on while you're there, gives you a chance to see all the creatures when they are most active."
466,2017-09-29,5,"Whether you're an adult or bringing your little ones to explore the sea creatures, there is enough to see and explore at this huge aquarium in Monterey.  It's located in the Canneryrow where you'll find lots of restaurants on this street.  Weekdays are far less crowded and parking is easy on the streets.  Weekends are very crowded especially during the summer time so plan wisely.Got out tickets from our hotel in Hyatt for $50/each person.  But it was good for two days.  Otherwise you'd have to get in line and purchase at the aquarium.  Try to see if your hotel sells the tickets to save time and long lines.  Plan on spending a minimum of 2 hours but longer if you'd like to see couple feedings.  The feeding schedule is spread out throughout the day.  You can always re-enter.  Plenty of places to eat in the area right outside the aquarium on Cannery Row.  Check out my video to get an idea of what to expect at the aquarium!youtu.be/1iEq9fL4N7g"
467,2017-12-09,5,"World renowned Aquarium in Monterey Bay. Great spot for people with kids of all ages, as well as curious adults. Excellent exhibition of various underwater species ranging from baby jelly fish to leopard sharks and penguins. Our toddler gives this place a 5/5."
468,2016-09-05,5,"Its pricey, and its unfortunate they don't have mermaids, but regardless this is probably the best aquarium ever!______$$_____________________ $$____$$$__$__________________$__$$$___$$$___$$________________$$___$$$___$$$$$$$$________________$$$$$$$$____$$$$$$__________________$$$$$$_____$$$$____$$0$$$$$0$$$____$$$$_______$$__$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$__$$___$$___$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$___$$_$$__$$__$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$__$$__$$$______$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$______$$__$$$____$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$____$$$__$__$___$$$$_$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$_$$$$___$_$_________$_$$$$$$$$$$$$_$_________$_$______$$$________________$$$______$_______$______________________$______$________________________$______$_______________________ _$Under the seaUnder the seaDarling it's betterDown where it's wetterTake it from meUp on the shore they work all dayOut in the sun they slave awayWhile we devotin'Full time to floatin'Under the sea!"
469,2019-04-16,4,My family came on a Monday and to our surprise it was pretty packed. I did appreciate the designated stroller parking for families with toddlers. My six year old had a blast and my two year old did as well. I do recommend buying tickets in advance as the line to purchase tickets was really long.
470,2019-05-13,5,Monterey Bay aquarium is a must see place if you are visiting the area. We have been there a few times and learned something new about Marine life in each visit.
471,2018-09-11,5,"Loved checking it out and walking around Monterey. It's slightly different from the Long Beach aquarium in that there are darker lit area exhibits, and the otters! What a treat for children. Cleaner than Long Beach."
472,2018-07-28,3,"I loved the Monterrey Aquarium years ago (1988). Today it is very dated and rather small for an aquarium. On the positive side, they do have temporary exhibits. There are also harbor seals in the bay, which hang around, so you have ready made shows. Also a very nice sea otter exhibit just off the main entrance.It is fairly standard for an aquarium. Lots of exhibits from the area. A lot of opportunities to touch wildlife. And a simulation of a wave hitting the building (unfortunately too many screaming kids piercing my ears, but that is not the aquarium's fault). The gift store is magnificent and they have wine and beer and food on Friday nights. We did not partake of the food, but did have a drink while we enjoyed the aquarium.It should take about 2-3 hours, unless you take in shows or mill around exhibits for a long time, so not a huge commitment. If you stay in the local hotels, B&Bs, etc, see if they have a 2 day for 1 price ticket, as they are only offered there. We did not take advantage, but it wasnice to have the option."
473,2018-08-07,5,There is so much to do here.  my boyfriend and I spent at least over 2 hours here. such an amazing experience. alot if little kids running around so be careful not to bump into them.
474,2019-05-06,5,If you've never been 10/10 would recommend. You just need to go one day and you'll be able to see it all. Lots of people so get there before opening otherwise you'll be waiting in a long line and when I say long that line is loooonggggg.
475,2019-03-01,4,Great spot to come and see marine life. Nice spot to bring kids. Overrun by groups/class trips. Maybe more shows at prime time would help crowding at special show times.
476,2019-01-21,5,"This place is one of my favorite places on this planet. Not only do they do AMAZING work for our oceans, but their customer service is top notch. I had an issue at my hotel where my room got flooded and I had to switch rooms, and during that chaos I lost my tickets. I called to make sure no one had used them, and she assured me no one did and that she can re-issue new tickets for me to print out. It seems small but man oh man it sure saved me from having a heart attack after spending $130 bucks on the tickets! I just love everything about this place and I can't wait to go back!"
477,2016-08-20,4,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is very cute. There is a lot to see here, and it's all very nicely laid out.I feel a bit bad giving only four stars; after all, I am a gigantic animal-lover, always have been, and this aquarium gets rave reviews from everyone and their mom. I'll let you in on a little secret... I'm from Chicago. It is VERY tough to compete with the Shedd and, since I grew up with that, my bar was set pretty high.That said, I loved it here. There were seahorses and otters, not to mention sharks of all sorts, and the photo opportunities abound. My favorite non-wildlife part was the outside deck. What a view! And inside, the sardines stole the show; I never knew how incredible these guys are. Captivating! Aquariums will always bring me back to childhood, and for that I am grateful."
478,2017-07-30,4,"Huge aquarium. Wow! I had heard a lot about this place but until I was there I didnt actually realize how big the place was..We had a family trip there with the kids. Great place for families and kids. Tons to see. They have a whole area dedicated as a play area for the kids. The shows, the tanks filled with sea life, the live birds, area for people to touch the sea life....all of it. Great!Huge area for food and tons of gift ideas in the shop. Only downfall, no sharks. Boo! Definitely recommend this place!"
479,2017-08-04,5,"I really enjoyed the aquarium second time around. The aquarium is a good size and totally walkable with lots of exotic sea life. The sea jellies are gorgeous and the huge grouper who stopped to greet the crowd was amazing. The aquarium is well maintained and very clean. It's evident the sea life are well taken care of. Water is clear, free of smells. The outdoor patio area upstairs facing the ocean is beautiful and breezy. Staff at check in are efficient get the line moving quickly and are very cordial. Highly recommended tourist spot."
480,2018-09-23,5,Heaven on earth above the surface yet where some o# us dream  below the surfsce of the sea !The Monterey bay Aquarium brings this to life for ALL!A magical place where dreams are real and whats real seems like a dream  all the beauty and mystetey of the sea shared and lovingly cared for and shown to assist and heal those in need of medical attention. A wonderful place to inspire and educate all ages! Nomatter how many visits you make!Theres always more to see!
481,2019-04-30,5,"Beautiful aquarium, tons of good exhibits and always changing. I feel like there's always something to do here."
482,2019-03-22,5,"Still one of my favorite places!! Went on a behind the scenes tour, definitely worth it! Highly recommend! I love watching the broadcast feeding online when I'm at work too, shh don't tell my boss haha"
483,2018-06-13,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is the big draw attraction for this area of course.  The exhibits are wonderfully executed and I was taken with just how friendly the mostly volunteer staff was.  You could not walk by one of them without receiving an offer of help and sometimes a great local story.  Even the view of the bay from the outside decks was amazing and I could have sat there for hours.  Plan to stay most of the day so you can attend the scheduled talks and feeding demonstrations while still taking your time to see all the rest.  Some of the exhibits have multiple viewing areas on more than one floor, it's a good idea to see them from both vantage points as you will notice different things from the different areas. The merchandise is pricey, I did appreciate the upscale household and decor items available, but I still need my affordable souvenirs.  I could not imagine much that I saw would be purchased by families with children.  There is a cafeteria station style restaurant where the selections are super limited although well portioned.  We were able to share the super large fruit salad along with some soup and were satisfied for lunch.  I wanted more in the sea birds area and could have done without the desert exhibit about Baja, California.  The sea otters are the stars and always my favorite.  We ordered our tickets through the AAA online prior to our visit, received a discount and did not have to wait in line."
484,2018-08-04,4,"My fiancé and I really enjoyed this aquarium.  We like how it is organized, very clean and the exhibits are very informative.  The open sea, jellyfish, otters and octopus were our favorites.  We also enjoyed the big wave pool.  The layout and spread is nice and open and has areas where you can relax, grab a bite and regroup."
485,2019-03-25,5,It was awesome and learned a lot .... loved the jellyfish and otters!!!  So much I didn't know very much about Marine life!!!
486,2017-07-09,5,"Hands down, the BEST aquarium. I've heard the Atlanta Aquarium is really great too, but this is the best one I have been to. Las Vegas? Better. Chicago? Better. Such a great place I'm proud to have almost in my backyard.Entrance is expensive. It cost about $175 for our two adults and two students to get in, but we spent hours there so I felt we got or money's worth. The food inside is super super expensive, so I suggest eating before going inside.A lot of the exhibits inside and outside the aquarium are dedicated to local fish and wildlife and preservation/conservation efforts which is nice to give it a local touch.My favorite parts of the aquarium were the jellyfish (a good sized exhibit), the sunfish (such a unique fish), the octopus (they had a few varieties), the lion fish, sea horses, and all the sharks! There were a few different varieties which was nice, but no great white anymore.Most of the aquariums are huge and you can view them from multiple sides where the other aquariums are smaller and less crowded. It was semi crowded when we went after lunch on a Friday, but the inside is so large that we didn't feel crammed in or that we couldn't get up front to all of the tanks.Go here!!!!! I want to go back already."
487,2019-03-04,4,Such a beautiful museum besides the $15 parking fee and $50 a per adult $30 per child to enter the museum.
488,2017-07-09,4,"I've wanted to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium, since I was a landlocked kid in the Midwest. Along the way to the present, I have visited aquariums in Chicago, Charleston, La Jolla, San Francisco, Long Beach, San Diego, Miami and even a private marine biology research facility off of Oahu.  So, by the time I finally got to visit Monterey, I have to admit, I wasn't as impressed.Why?1. Crowds.  It was late spring and the crowds were thick.  At Every exhibit, you had to wait your turn to get close and look through the glass and felt pressure for how long you stared into the glass because people were breathing down your neck.2. Price. $49.95 adult, $39.95 studentHowever, Staff is very knowledgeable and there are plenty of hands-on educational activities for the kids.  Incredible, massive tanks.  My favorite exhibit were the jellyfish; many types to observe.A great aquarium, but you can find quality aquariums for the kids without the crowds or price (one of my favorites was in charleston, sc; we were regulars there)."
489,2017-12-23,5,"We are avid aquarium goers/lovers and have the year's pass to this one with the 2 guest passes for $300.  We decided on that one to help with sea life outreach programs.  Man, it's so worth it because it's so awesome. We can browse and get lost in here for hours and hours. The best thing here for our family is the jelly fish and sea otters. They are mesmerizing and so entertaining to watch. Kids liked the touch stations."
490,2019-04-17,4,"Fun place to take the kids. Certain staff/volunteers seem to really get into their job..which makes it a great experience. Theyre passionate about keeping the oceans clean, and have fun ways of displaying it. The only down side is we noticed some fish with parasites and some dead. I understand its inevadeable with wildlife..but having to explain to my daughter the fish is asleep is hard..especially when we have a tank at home and she knows they don't sleep like that. But..over all.. A great place to go. The life size whales hanging overhead are incredible!"
491,2017-07-13,5,"My first time visiting this aquarium -- i've been wanting to come here as a kid and now i finally got to as a Mom. So happy that i got to take my toddler here. It was so much fun. So many things to see and do for the little ones. I was here during the July 4th weekend and it was PACKED!! So many different exhibits: open sea, jelly fish area, octopus, rays, kelp forest, coral reef, and many more!  while i like the open sea, i think my favorite exhibit was jelly fish and the deep sea area where there was this LARGE tank with all these different fish swimming around. The open sea was not bad, but because it mimicked the natural habitat it wasnt as abundant. But the feeding session was really cool! But how can i forget the sea otters? they are SO cute!!! i like that there are a couple of tide pools areas for little kids to touch the sea life. There's also a playground area for the little kids which was nice little change of pace. overall definitely recommend this aquarium.. wish there were more of this type of aquarium which truly teaches people the marine lifea good 3 hours will be sufficient, but with a toddler in tow, better to break it into two days so it's not as exhausting."
492,2017-08-07,4,"Beautiful aquarium, centrally located in Monterey and a great place to visit while you are in town. My husband and I choose to go later in the day and stay for the live music in the evenings. I truly enjoyed it.We spent the first hour or so looking around aquarium and 30 minutes before the music started we made our way to the stage area. They sell beer and wine and a few food items during the evening. Overall it was a very enjoyable and different way to see the Aquarium."
493,2019-09-05,3,"I'm from San Francisco. Maybe I'm spoiled by the renovated Academy of Sciences there. But this place is small, overpriced, outdated (built 1984) and way too crowded. The sea life in the aquarium looked...how do I put it...sad. The otters and puffins were happy to be there though. There is a ton of cute merchandise too! I almost bought some, but I couldn't bring myself to wear some swag and brag to my friends about visiting such a numb place. Parking is also too much of a hassle for the visit. It took me 30 minutes to find parking because the whole street that the aquarium is on is a hotspot for tourists. Not worth it to me."
494,2016-06-26,4,"Thank you Monterey Bay Aquarium for the Military Discount!Ten years was the last time I was in Monterey and I couldn't wait to get back and see the aquarium with the boys. A few years ago they had a Great White shark in captivity but they had to return him to the wild since he started eating other fish. The Sun Fish was another fascinating lure but to our dismay he wasn't here either because he wasn't able to eat in captivity.  Some animals just belong in the wild. Anyway, with these two rare species gone, we came here hoping to at least see one. I was disappointed in the Otter exhibit since they are the ""Shamu"" of the aquarium. The exhibit was small. On the second floor there were only two viewing windows with tons of people and it was hard to really enjoy them.The Kelp Forest display housed a few large fish and sharks but it was nothing outstanding. They did have a Hammerhead shark on exhibit but after seeing them in the Vegas shark exhibit this was underwhelming.  I guess because it was the shark and only a few other fish in the tank. The aquarium itself was huge with life-size Orcas and Blue Whales hanging high above for display.  The auditorium was a five star experience. Shows were playing almost every hour and we caught two very informative shows so we really enjoyed it. The eel exhibit stood out as a fun exhibit.  Jellyfish are always a winner and are a highlight here in Monterey. Learning about the pool tides was also a plus.The gift shop was nice with plenty of souvenir shirts to purchase but they were pricey.Overall I felt a bit underwhelmed since we were hoping to see at least the Sunfish, but lucky for us we saw one on our whale watching trip.I love aquariums and its still a great learning environment for kids. Check the website for admission prices."
495,2018-02-20,5,"So much fun and so much to see! It can get super crowded here so my tips would be to avoid weekends/holidays if possible and get there early. Top three must sees at the Aquarium:1. Flamboyant Cuttlefish (in the tentacles exhibit) - coolest, weirdest, little magical creatures ever!2. Feeding of the Otters (get there at least 30 min before the feeding to secure a spot by the window)3. Jellyfish (take note of the mini ones as well - so cool)You could easily spend upwards of 4 hours here, so make sure to set aside a good portion of your day for the Aquarium!"
496,2019-08-14,5,"This is one of our favorite places. This visit (a week ago) we took the 1-hour ""behind the scenes"" tour. Our volunteer guide, Cara, was tremendous. You can really tell how passionate the volunteer and staff are about the aquarium and conservation. One note, I don't think kids younger than about 10 or 11 would enjoy the tour as much. It is fascinating, but you stand still a lot and listen, and some parts of the tour the area to move around in is small."
497,2017-06-22,4,"Made a quick trip down to Monterey and the aquarium was the #1 thing on my to do list. I was lucky to have guest passes for myself and my boyfriend, courtesy of a family friend so that saved us $100. We parked downtown on Tyler St. at a parking garage for $7 and the MST Trolley took us down to the aquarium for free. Highly recommend that, unless you can find street parking. We went to the aquarium on a Wednesday and arrived at 11am. We entered through the members entrance which was super quick, no wait at all. Where do I begin? Some of my favorite exhibits were of course the jellyfish, otters, penguins, pretty much everything! I spent a good amount of time at the pacific sardine tank. It was mesmerizing to see all the fish swim around in unison. There were so many cool things to see, I could go on and on. But for sure the jellyfish were my favorite. We spent about three or four hours walking around and checking things out. I was surprised at how busy the place was even on a Wednesday. KIDS EVERYWHERE! Tourists everywhere. Flashing cameras everywhere (you're not supposed to take pictures with flash people!) It was a bit frustrating trying to look around and you've got little ones running around and such. I think that's my only gripe about the place, it was just way too crowded. I read online that the fall and winter months are the best time. Tuesday-Thursday are the best days (not during summer) and the best hours are between 2-6 if I recall. I didn't interact much with the staff, but they all seemed informative and enthusiastic to be at their job. Food wise, I didn't even consider looking at the cafe because I knew it would be overpriced. I brought some water and snacks and just ate along the way. I would have paid the $50 if I had to, just because this is one of the better aquariums around. There's so much to see and do, it's worth it especially if you can get a student discount or snag yourself a guest pass. Try to plan accordingly to avoid the busy crowds, just so you have as much time to look around and stare at the fishies. Great place to go with your family, friends, significant other, or even by yourself lol."
498,2017-09-27,5,"The Nursing lounge was amazing, it was just what I needed during our visit with our infant and two year old. The nursing lounge features three comfy rocking chairs, relaxing music and a big screen tv. There's even a bottle warmer! And of course the aquarium was amazing as usual!!"
499,2018-11-20,4,"Monterey Aquarium is a very cool aquarium. They have a variety of exhibits and are doing good work to help research, protect and bring awareness to the health of the ocean. They do daily feedings as well as shows covering different topics about the ocean. It's not the biggest aquarium that I've been to and some of the exhibits are on the smaller side. They have a lot of information about the animals in the tanks and  you can learn a lot by reading the placards in front of the exhibits. You'll find a lot of families on the weekends and they have some interactive exhibits that the kids can play with and get their hands dirty (literally). They do have the student tickets which can save you a couple bucks and I'd recommend going off peak so you can really enjoy the different exhibits. One of the things I like about aquatic life is the peaceful nature of watching them in the water and that's best done without the hectic nature of the weekends which brings kids and tourists alike. It's worth checking out and supporting the research they do."
500,2018-05-30,5,Took the nephews-we were almost 1st in line-and the boys loved every minute of it. Our plan was to head to the otters first -  which was brilliant as this is the most popular display at the aquarium and the lines around it are long and heavy.  We spent three wonderful hours at the aquarium and by that time we were exhausted and went to lunch. We all valid to return another time. It was so much fun. Love the sardine display. And the location is so much fun
501,2019-01-21,5,"We brought both our kids before the eldest turned 3. It was a great experience for all of us. We tried to plan the trip on a holiday weekend during a storm so maybe it wouldn't be so busy...but it was. Having said that, it's not their fault my eldest got overstimulated and we had to leave after an hour. Anyway, we bought our tickets ahead of time, and it was so worth it not having to wait in the ticket line! I definitely recommend doing that. The bathrooms downstairs by the cafe were very nice with large changing stations (which we didn't need). The only thing that really stunk about this in our opinion is paying $30 to park. Beware that parking might be atrocious if you go! It was definitely worth the expense though, but we won't be back for a few years."
502,2018-05-17,5,"Love our aquarium!  Stopped by the other day just to see the feeding show.  I could spend two weeks going through each amazing display.  Don't miss the feeding show, the perfect way to learn about the fishes in the tank."
503,2017-09-09,4,"The views from the decks are amazing.  The jelly fish are beautiful.  However, for 50.00 per adult and 40.00 per child, I thought the exhibits were a bit thin... We loved watching the fish etc but full price is a bit much.  Would be happy to go back if we found coupons or discount tickets somewhere!  There were no sharks in the big tanks as they all had died (according to the employee).  Most of what we saw in the big tank were sardines and a few tuna.  The otters are amazing and so much fun to watch!"
504,2018-06-02,4,"This place is one out of our memories. We both came here when we were kids. The sea life fascinates both of us. As adults, there isn't much to do other than eat and look at fish. The aquarium is more suited for kids. The only con of the aquarium is the how expensive it is."
505,2018-08-22,5,"Treat yourself!Go here.It's worth it.Great for ALL AGESExcellent Facility, staff, volunteers, animals, etc.Go here!"
506,2018-07-09,5,"Wonderful aquarium! I thought about skipping out on it due to it costing $50 for an adult, but I'm really glad I ended up going even though I probably wouldn't go again unless I have kids one day and happen to be in Monterey again. It's a really nice, clean, and interesting place with plenty to see. It was so cool touching a stingray! My favorite part would definitely be the jellyfish tanks. There were at least 6 different jellyfish species there, and it was so relaxing to watch them just move in the water. This aquarium has this self illuminating rainbow jellyfish that has glowing lights. My favorite exhibit for sure. It was truly mesmerizing watching that. If you're on the fence about whether to go or not because of the price... GO. It's worth it to experience it and it's not an every week kind of thing you'd do."
507,2016-07-09,3,"Finally got to check this place out since i didnt get to last time when i was visiting Monterey.$49.95 per for adult if you go through general admission...quite expensive but you're going for the experience if you have never been there before. Its a good place to go with your family. Came here on a Saturday and its summer so of course it gets busy. It has 2 levels...some areas are really cool while some are alright. Get to see variety of sea animals that live in or by water...If you take your time here, you can spend a good 2 to 3 hours here or longer...Now i can finally take off my wish list of places to visit"
508,2017-08-28,4,"I came to Monterey with my family and of course we had to check out the aquarium.  It's the famous attraction in Monterey.  The admission prices are very expensive even for an aquarium though - $50 for adults.  My sister managed to bring her student ID since it's $40 for students.  However, the place was huge.  They have many levels and outside areas as well.  There are a lot of exhibits to see.  My favorites were definitely the open sea exhibit - the jellyfish tanks were just beyond amazing.  They had so many types of jellyfish, most of them I've never seen before.  I also enjoyed the kelp forest tank - they actually had a feeding at 4:00 PM and we watched it.  They had a lot of interactive exhibits for kids - coloring on iPads, touch pools, playgrounds, etc. so it's really good for kids.  Be sure to park on the street with meter parking nearby since it's cheaper."
509,2019-03-11,5,"Dont miss this Aquarium. Spend the day, 4 hours is not enough. Ask the volunteers anything, there are more than 700 volunteers at this amazing attraction. That should tell you how well run this aquarium is."
510,2019-08-28,4,Love the Aquarium....not membership services.  Early renewals a problem as well as staff attitude.  Need customer service training.
511,2018-04-29,3,"This would be a GREAT place for kids- lots of interactive areas, etc. we went on a Friday afternoon around 2 and we were overrun by school class trips, and lots of very rude families who let their children run free and push people out of the way. We probably would have stayed longer if it wasn't so busy, but we got frustrated and left because of not being able to actually see exhibits without being crawled on by someone else's children or feeling rushed. While we were there though, the staff was VERY pleasant and informative through multiple exhibits. They even had an outdoor deck which was perfect for a sunny day that had binoculars you could use to look out at the water. There was a staff member out there letting you know what kinds of wildlife he was seeing and where to look, etc which was great."
512,2019-02-23,2,"Beautiful day in Monterey, decided to visit the aquarium.  Over priced and limited attractions.  Waste of time, have seen better aquariums across the US and this was by far a disappointment.  I gave two stars rather than one because of the advocacy for saving and preserving sea life."
513,2017-05-19,4,"Here's a really useful tip I wish I knew before I walked in. The Monterey Bay Aquarium offers AAA members a discount ($5 off), but you must buy your tickets ahead of time. I didn't know that, so we had to pay the full adult admission of $49.95!Try and go early (right when they open) on the weekdays during non-summer months, since it's much more crowded on the weekends and during the summer in general. We went on a weekday, but my plans were foiled by busloads and busloads of elementary school students. We just had to plow through the teeming crowds.To optimize a potentially crowded experience, I recommend carefully looking at the feeding times for the animals. If you can skip these events without feeling you missed out on something, go to the opposite end of the aquarium and it should be much less crowded. On a good day you can have a wing all to yourself like we did on a January weekday several years ago.I love the jellyfish exhibit, and the Outer Bay is one of my favorites. I looked for that huge sunfish for a very long time, but never saw it. The hammerhead shark and sea turtle were very cool to watch though. We sat on the balcony and just watched the fish swim by...But the ¡Viva Baja! Life on the Edge exhibit I found a little incongruous. Desert tortoise and mountain kingsnake at an aquarium? I thought everything here is supposed to be underwater!The only big minus?  It's very expensive to come here, compared to the Steinhart at the California Academy of Sciences."
514,2018-09-06,4,"Good time for the family. They have a few kids areas that make this great for little ones. Oddly I wish they had more animals and possibly more sharks, however will come back for sure."
515,2018-07-01,5,"This is one of the best aquariums I've ever been to. There are so many animals and exhibits to see. I kept expecting it to end but it never did. Many of the displays are unique compared to other aquariums, such as the anchovy or water bird exhibits. We had so much fun that we walked around a second time. Cannot recommend going enough, totally worth the price."
516,2017-10-26,5,"Perfect place to take the family. Beautiful facility, plenty of kids activities, lovely dining area.Kids had a blast for a number of hours (water play area, indoor slides, interactive area). Clean bathrooms too. This place attracts lots of international visitors and for good reason. We went with friends who had the Ocean Advocate membership, so we were very thankful to have free admission!"
517,2017-08-12,4,"We've been here about five times or so. It's a must for youth or sea living adults! A couple blocks away you can find parking! Hint! Go during the week before 1pm!It has a great historical explanation within the exhibits as well as clear and large viewing glass. This place makes you want a fish tank at home if you don't already have one. . Group on periodically has deals for the family and you'd save about 20%. It has many of the traditional oceanography and ecological memes you expect from an aquarium and are educational and interesting. It's a staple for field trips for many , many schools as well it should be!"
518,2016-05-16,5,"Ah the Monterey Bay Aquarium, we finally meet (again). It only took me some 20 plus years to return to the place that marveled me so as a child. The City of Monterey was essentially our first stop on our PCH trip for the very reason to see this grand aquarium again. My usual strategy on visiting any sort of aquarium or zoo is to try to do so during the week, preferably when school is session as well, all to avoid the crowds and we did that with our visit  here too. The price of the aquarium is about what I expected (40 bucks for adults) and I think that since it is still the best aquarium I've visited, you get great value and the price is comparable to other aquariums. While all the feedings seem to get a lot of attention (and they do have several) with the otter and open sea seemingly being the most popular, we ended up avoiding them mostly as they were extremely crowded and you can only really watch animals eat fish for so long. If you do want to get a great view of the otters eating you'll have to start waiting at the exhibit fairly early on. We did fight through the jungle of strollers  (darn those kids for wanting to learn about all the cool stuff in the ocean!) to get a view of the otters swimming around for a minute or two, then promptly moved on to the other many great things featured in this place. We covered the whole area in about an hour and a half, which I thought was a good pace. For me, my favorites are still the Kelp Forest and Cephalopod/Octopus/Jelly Fish exhibits.  Both areas make for splendid pictures to take home. One note, if you want to catch great views of the Open Sea exhibit before and during feeding time, just stay on the first/bottom floor of the exhibit. Everyone was crowded above us and we saw just as much. Also, definitely stick around the Kelp Forest until you're able to see a skate or ray swim by. Probably one of the most majestic and scenic things you'll see at the aquarium. So I am happy to say that the Monterey Aquarium held up to my lofty (and often unrealistic) childhood memories and I hope it does for you as well."
519,2017-10-23,5,I absolutely enjoyed this place! I remember coming here as a child with my parents and now I had the chance of going again as an adult. There are many exibits to look at so take your time. There are multiple levels so make sure you don't miss anything. My favorite were the jellyfish. It looks like they are glowing in the dark floating. To me the marine life is very therapeutic to watch. Expect to spend at least 3 hours here if you actually visit and watch each exibit. There are also feeding times throughout the day of some of the creatures if you are interested. They have a mini cafe on the 1st floor. The ticket price is reasonable considering how big the place is and all the attractions. I highly recomm visiting this aquarium. Closest parking garage is about a 10 minute walk with many shops and places to eat on the way.
520,2018-06-29,5,"This place is awesome. I like how things were organized in the exhibits. The prices where higher than I was expecting, but it's a situation of you get what you pay for! The restaurant/cafe gas food food of you're willing to spend the money and walk through that chaos. Soft drinks and coffee have free refills!"
521,2018-05-24,5,This place is The Bomb! Came up to visit our niece at Monterey State and of course we couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit here and take it all in.If you enjoy otters - it's a great place to see them up close and learn about them. True for all the other sea life here. A great day and a great place to spend the day with or without kids.
522,2017-08-20,5,"This place is worth the price especially if you get the 2 day ticket if you buy it at a local motel/hotel/inn.  $50 is a lot but there's so much to do here and honestly this was the highlight of our trip to Monterey Bay.  Our kids loved it here and that's what was most important, The aquarium is huge and there is a lot to do, must see if you've never been."
523,2019-02-27,5,Awesome Place. Great place to visit when in Monterey. Staff is knowledgeable and they have a wide amount of ocean life.
524,2017-06-26,5,"What a beautiful aquarium! Definitely a must stop when you come to Monterey to visit. Check online for some discounts! Military, student, AAA, are a few discounts available. There is a vast array of marine life available here. I spent hours here with my friends and it was awesome. After, walk to cannery row for food!"
525,2018-07-30,4,"Great place for kids! Had fun. A little spendy, and very crowded. Parking was very challenging! We were there in the summer though. Beautiful place to visit at least once."
526,2017-06-04,4,"I came here with a friend a few weeks ago when she was visiting from out of town. It's pricey, but it's definitely one of the better aquariums near the Bay Area.I'd say it takes about 2-3 hours to go through the entire aquarium. My favorite part is the petting station, where you can feel various sea creatures like sea stars and manta rays.There's also really cool feedings/shows throughout the day. Be sure to sign up for the text alerts so you get reminders of where they are. Sometimes there's unplanned ones as well."
527,2016-06-06,4,"I had a great time here with my family! I enjoyed seeing and learning about the animals. There's a fun play area for kids upstairs. My favorite exhibit was the jellyfish, they're just so pretty and they move so gracefully! If it weren't for the hefty admission price, I would come more often. $49.95 for adults$39.95 for students$29.95 for children age 3-12"
528,2017-08-16,4,"Freaking so many kids running around.. even on a Friday morning.. I can't imagine what it's like on the weekends. There's a big crowd for the feedings too, so arrive about 15 to 20 min early to grab the best spots.Good spot otherwise - super educational, very clean. Staff is also very knowledgeable."
529,2019-02-23,5,Fun but kinda crowded lol the kelp forest feeding was the most fun!!! Otter feeding was super cute too!!
530,2017-07-25,5,"Wow! I do NOT recommend visiting this place on weekends and holidays. It is so crowded that there is no where to park (all parking lots, garages and street parking were full within walking distance), no where to eat (plan on an hour wait or more), and the aquarium is so crowded that there is barely room to move about and small children have difficulty getting close enough to some exhibits to see them. Pros: Great views of Monterey Bay from the viewing decks, the exhibits are awesome if you can get near enough to enjoy them, and feeding time shows are awesome if you can get close enough to see what is happening.Cons: Lots of walking for the mobility impaired and the cost of admission is extremely steep. Our party had 2 adults ($49.95 each), 1 senior ($39.95), and 4 children ages 3-12 ($29.95 each) for a total of $259.65 (a lot of money for a few hours of fun). We ended up eating in the cafe here and it is pricey as well. A banana and an apple came to $4.11. Five child sized pizzas and one small mac and cheese came to $65."
531,2017-10-04,5,I was coming here every since it was just a fish bowl and 2 goldfish. It is wonderful to see what it has become. Now I bring the kid and she gets to experience all the wonders of the ocean.It is a wonderful place to get kids interested in ocean life.I wish though that the sea otter exhibit could be refreshed for better access and viewing. The kid area also is starting to get a little tired and could use a refresh.I am looking forward to the day when I can bring my grand kids here to see aquatic life from other planets.
532,2017-05-02,5,"It's been many years (before the kid came along) since we last visited.  My best lingering memory was staring at the beautiful jelly fish, so my expectations were set. Seriously, I haven't seen any aquarium that compares! First of all, if you're a AAA member, stop by the office the day before and purchase your discounted tickets. Granted, it's a just a few bucks off ($50 pp?! but it goes to a non profit anyway) but it all adds up for a family.As far as parking, parking prices range.  If you have limitations, park close by.  But if you don't mind walking, park a few blocks away.  I lucked out with free parking and got to walk alongside the ocean trail.  Nice! It's interesting that our perspective completely changes when children are involved. For some reason, I have almost no recollection of my first visit over 15 years prior.  With a child, I notice layout, restrooms, avoiding strollers, gift shops and places to eat.  As far as refreshment, there are many places just outside the aquarium that can cater to your preferences, so I recommend getting your hand stamped and come and go as you please.  We saw the Penguin show which was really cute.  Try to catch some of the films which ware very informative and I enjoyed watching the shark feeding.  The gift shop(s) carry nice merchandise.  The main one has excellent items that I considered purchasing and the prices were not that steep.Definitely recommend for the educational value."
533,2017-04-16,5,"Absolutely gorgeous, eye-drawing, and mind-captivating.Growing up in Seattle, I've had my share of the Seattle aquarium, as well as the Vancouver aquarium. I had heard such great things about Monterey's aquarium but never had the chance to go. With my move to California, visiting Monterey was on the top of my list. My aquatic loving partner and I parked in the Cannery Row garage on a Monday afternoon. You can find parking garages and spots closer to the aquarium, but we decided to park here. All day parking was only $10. We then walked to the aquarium. Thanks to our friends who have member passes, we were able to visit the aquarium with no cost. (Hurray!)There is a lot to see at the aquarium so make sure to set aside time. If you want to listen to all the talks, see the feedings, and watch the shows, set aside at least 3 hours or so. My partner and I mainly just wanted to see the exhibits (we stayed for one show) and spent about 2 hours here. The aquarium is set up so nicely so that you're able to read all the labels. It's very educational and set up in a way that really encourages learning. I seriously enjoyed looking at the majestic waters and lost myself in the movement of fish. I adored watching Nemo and Dory of course. The octopus were so cool, and there were different species of fish and crustaceans that I had never seen before. As everyone has already mentioned, the jelly fish exhibit is ridiculous. They are so vivid and vibrant. I swear everyone has a photo of the jelly fish tank here. I also enjoyed the outdoor section with the birds. You can also touch starfish and sting rays. We came during an elementary field trip so we figured all the kiddos would want to touch them first.We watched the show of Luna the baby otter. I was dying of cuteness and then had to see the otter exhibit. I watched them feed the otters as well. Otters are SO cute.You can really learn a lot here. The only downside is that because it's so popular, it's quite crowded. You're caught waiting a while for people to look and then move. After the two hours in there with tons of kids roaming about, I was pretty beat and exhausted from being in a crowd.I understand the cost of admission is upwards around $50 (bring student ID for a discount). However, it is definitely a must see at least once in your life."
534,2017-05-05,4,"So I actually drove from Los Angeles to this place over my spring break. To be honest, I'm not sure if it was worth the trip. I love fishes and marine life, which is why I've been wanting to come here for a few years now. First off, parking was horrible. I had to find parking a few blocks away, because the aquarium doesn't seem to have its own parking structure. That might just be on me though, because it was my first time here and I'm not familiar with the area at all. There's plenty to eat and look at around the area though, so it's pretty nice after you're done exploring the aquarium. Parking aside, my biggest issue with this aquarium is that the prices are pretty high. I had a student discount, and I still felt that the prices were very high. It's nearly double how much The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach charges. Of course, the price is fine and all if the place was huge, but that isn't really the case here. This is definitely quite a bit smaller than the Aquarium in Long Beach. The great thing is that although the place isn't huge, they had plenty of other marine animals that Long Beach doesn't have. I felt that the overall look of this place was interesting. The Long Beach Aquarium honestly, looks and feels much like an amusement park. It's an aquarium, but they have things like birds, which they let you feed. On the other hand, this place looks more serious and like it's a research center. It was also a bit crowded when I came here, and given the size of the aquarium, felt a bit cramped. Overall, this place was a nice experience, but I'm not sure I would drive here again from LA, just for the aquarium. I definitely much prefer the overall look of the place, but the price and size of it is a bit disappointing."
535,2019-01-20,5,"Always a favorite here. We come for one exhibit, for the day, for just wondering around, and always learn something new. Thank you for the sustainable lessons!"
536,2017-07-17,5,"The aquarium was amazing! They have a cafe, restaurant and coffee stand. They also have a few gift shops. It's a two store aquarium. It has a bunch of cool activities for the kids. We bought our tickets using our hotel code, when we did that we got two days at the aquarium for the price of one. We are looking forward to going again tomorrow. There was so much to look at. The kids loved all the touch zones. The staff and volunteers were amazing."
537,2018-06-07,5,"The aquarium was so much fun! I couldn't get enough pictures of the sharks! The sea life is mesmerizing. The feeding time shows, were good too. I suggest getting to the areas where the shows will be early, to get good seats or be in a good viewing area. The aquarium was definitely trying to put a spot light on how plastic can pollute the oceans & hurt the life in it. The plastic showcases were beautiful too."
538,2018-12-09,5,They have the best sushi at this place. Very fresh and you can pick your own from the tide pool.
539,2016-06-27,5,Outstanding - Amazing - Inspirational - a must see for everyone 3 years old to 100+ years old. A must see if your on Monterey California.
540,2019-02-16,4,"Eric was so helpful giving information over the phone. He went above and beyond to go find out the availability and pricing of certain things on the menu we were specifically interested in (the website, regrettably, has no prices on it). Five stars for excellent service from Eric, but one star deducted from the overall review because the restaurant chef, Matthew Beaudin, refused to let us order clam chowder while in the dining area that served wine, despite the fact that he is the chef for both the restaurant (with the wine) and the cafe (with the clam chowder). Someone clearly has a fragile ego. Not to mention that chowder was also beyond disappointing. Will not be dining here again."
541,2016-04-14,5,"I haven't been here since I was 7 or 8 and it felt like a brand new experience when I went yesterday. First, my only major qualm is the price. This is not a cheap aquarium. I don't know where it's ranked among the big aquariums of the world, but it isn't cheap. Apparently the animals eat hundreds of pounds of food a day, so someone has to pay for it right? Still, the experience is amazing. They have a very diverse line up of majestic beings from the sea. Looking at the fish, and then some 300 +lb dude screaming for his family to hurry up, makes me think we are not as evolved as this fish when in the same room. There are so many beings of beauty and elegance here and it looks like they are all well taken care of. It's not the biggest aquarium I've been to, but time will still fly while here. I couldn't believe how little ground we covered within a few hours. There is much to look at, and I loved the octopus section in the first floor. This is a place that you should take your kids and family whenever you have a chance. It's worth it."
542,2019-09-03,3,"Some neat exhibits, but not worth the price. A nice ""one time experience"" to have, but I wouldn't waste money on a membership. Only so many times you can see the same things over and over."
543,2017-09-21,4,"Amazing attractions, with some room for even more improvement.I loved watching the otter feeding time (so playful!), although amphitheater-style steps would give more guests a clear view.  My favorite exhibit.The Open Sea feeding show was magnificent, but I would have liked more camera coverage on the sunfish (since it was conducted far from the glass).  I wonder if the sea turtle feeding could also be done live (instead of pre-recorded), but I realize that might not fit in the show schedule.My toddler loved the touch pools; I was surprised not to see any starfish there.  The one crab we saw looked rather sad (I would be too if I were poked and prodded all day).  The bat rays all crowded in the corner far from grabby hands (I don't blame them at all, but they may as well be in a different exhibit where they can be seen swimming freely).Prices at the restaurant are surprisingly pretty reasonable, but the chicken sandwiches were a little dry.  (Clam chowder was good, as were the fries that came with the sandwich.)  There's no designated stroller parking spots in the dining area, but there is a suitable space along the wall near the high chairs.I would like to see a few more restrooms, just because there's so many guests during peak times.  One of the rare occasions I've had to wait for a men's room stall."
544,2019-02-14,5,"Since moving to Monterey a few years ago, I became impressed with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I already had visited many time to the National Aquarium in Baltimore. So, I have the ability to compare the the two. The Aquarium back East is larger then the one in Monterey. But the Monterey Aquarium is more family oriented on a more personal scale. The volunteering staff in Monterey has more time to devote to visitors. I am still waiting to see how the new expansion will benefit the visiting public."
545,2019-08-31,5,"Eric W is a fantastic guide at the Aquarium.  ""Octopus Boy"" taught me more than I ever knew about Octopi (hope that's the correct plural).  People kept flashing their cameras for pics, however.  I think a ""no flash"" sign on the rock would be more visible and make the public take notice, even though the Aquarium is now a flash-free zone. Thank you, Eric, for a spectacular education!!"
546,2017-04-03,5,Great aquarium and exhibits. I went this past weekend and it was easy to park down a side street as well as get in without to many lines. facility is clean and staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The open ocean and otter exhibits were my favorite although I enjoyed the whole thing and saw some great animals up close. A great way to spend 3-4 hours in Monterrey and it is central to many other activities and food.
547,2019-08-29,5,Wonderful place. Love being members. My kids love this place. Always clean and volunteers so knowledgeable. Great conservation efforts too!!
548,2016-05-10,5,"What? No review? How is this possible? Been here 5 times, the first time was when I first arrived here in the US back in 1992. I know! Most of you weren't even born in 1992. To those that actually remember 1992... I know! There are adults walking around that weren't even alive when we were in high school! Yikes!!!Anyway...Tickets are pretty pricey at $40 for adults and $24 for children. Parking across the street is practically non-existent but there are a lot of parking lots within walking distance.I never learn EVERYTHING in each visit; there is always something else to learn. I learned so much about sustainability, local marine life, marine ecosystem and local history because of this aquarium.Bottomline: You will get your money's worth because there is plenty for both the kids and the adults.But if you want more information...The giant two-story aquarium at the entrance is as impressive the 5th time as it was the first time. Make sure you stop by when they feed the fish and sharks. The diver gives a small talk from inside the aquarium and it is always cool to listen to Darth Vader educate the kiddos.The jellyfish display is amazing.The sea horses make this aquarium stand out from the other aquariums.The tidal wave recreation tunnel is very cool and always calming.The Large Fish tank is a must-see. As organisms on top of the food chain, it is amazing that we are eating other organisms several factors larger than us.They have a bird sanctuary too. Their restaurant seafood guide is very handy.They have plenty of play spaces for toddlers too. Came one time with a toddler. Came another time with a child AND a toddler (toddler from previous visit grew into the child). Came as a teenager. Came with a senior citizen. I have never been disappointed and none that I've come here with have been disappointed yet.AQUARIUM AS AN EVENT VENUEI was lucky enough to be here for a special event in the evening too. The aquarium was closed to the public and only our party was there. Oh how romantic the place seemed to transform into. With the eerie blue glow from the tanks and the candles on the table. Yup. Very nice.The food was provided by the aquarium according to the server. Very tasty. They also had a very good dessert table and hot drinks table. I highly recommend using the aquarium as a venue for your special event."
549,2019-02-24,5,Super great time at the aquarium today! Very interactive and a great experience for children. I highly recommend not eating anywhere within walking distance unless you enjoy being disappointed.
550,2018-04-06,1,"Aquarium was great.  The horrible experience at their Cafe left me in a sour mood, thus a one star rating.  Looks like there was another recent review with a similar experience.  I was scolded on multiple occasions for sitting at a table with my two young boys while we waited for my wife to pay for our food.  Apparently you are not allowed to sit at their tables until you have your food in hand.  Ridiculous. I kept having to repeat to different staff that my wife was already in line, paying. It's not like we were non-paying customers taking up a table.  We spent over $75 on three kids pizzas and two bowls of soup.  Their supervisor that day, Cristian, was not very helpful in handling the situation, but did give me his manager's contact info.  I emailed their manager,  as well as sent two comments detailing our experience at the Cafe via the aquarium's ""Contact Us"" link and have yet to receive a response.  I'm regretting spending the $300 on their Ocean Advocate membership after this recent trip."
551,2017-07-03,5,Much better experience this year!We got free parking and guest tickets from friends!Yikes! Such a huge line at MBA - Monterey Bay Aquarium! Luckily We got in thru member entrance - NO LINE! [Trick][Trick]This sea otter just likes me and swims towards me! It's been 2 years while Ivy's face is still so chubby! LolllBlabla red crab starts life as plankton and it can swim with his buttock! Heck yeah!
552,2018-06-03,4,"It's a very nice, very clean aquarium. There are some really cool huge tanks in rooms that make you feel like you're underwater. We went the first weekend in June, on a Saturday, at noon. It was incredibly packed with a ton of young kids. I'd go  during the week if I could change anything. It's great for kids though, very educational."
553,2018-08-24,4,"As I Yelp about the many places I have visited in my life, the Monterey Aquarium stands out; and I don't know why. It's not exceptionally large or impressive, although there is a visible kelp forest, which is something many people are not aware of. There is also a massive viewing wall for a huge tank with lots of seating, which was groundbreaking in its day and is still beautiful to see. Plus, there is a very cool jellyfish section and plenty of exhibits to keep youngsters entertained.In itself, Monterey is a neat little coastal town and there are beaches where you can still find various colors of ""ocean polished"" Agate and Jasper, especially after a good storm! Or you can get a drive-thru meal and sit on a beach and eat (pay to park). If you enjoy winding coastal driving, Highway 1 is always an amazing drive with plenty of beaches to explore without getting too far away from gas and lodging."
554,2017-08-31,3,"Beautiful beautiful aquarium.  The tight cylindrical aquariums gave me the heebie jeebies watching the fish swimming in endless circles. The giant main aquarium was better with all species swimming in harmony. I enjoyed watching the schooling fish and their incredible evasion moves. There were a few too many kids running around which is totally expected. I love kids and I was not bothered more than a tiny bit!  We paid the $50 entrance fee (each) and spent less than 30 minutes. It was a nice experience to see the different kinds of aqua-life, but too many people bumping into me in the enclosed space. Maybe I have some claustrophobia, but I had to get out of that tight space!"
555,2019-08-22,5,"I always loved the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Every time you go, you discover something new. Recently a friend of mine filled out a form for the aquarium and recommended an exhibit about Nudibranches. I was so excited when I saw a new tank with Nudibranchs in the kid section. I hope that they can make a full exhibition about these animals in the future!"
556,2018-07-13,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium has always held a special place in my heart. When I was a wee little tot, my parents bought me and my brother memberships and drove us 3 hours each way on the weekends so that we could see all of the amazing animals (we have always been water babies). Having been to the aquarium in Atlanta a few years ago, I can't say my idyllic views of the Monterey Bay Aquarium have stayed the same. While the aquarium is large, it does not offer enough interesting animals and stimulation to warrant a $100 price tag for two people. The tide pools mostly have kelp (that any person who has been to a beach so annoyingly has to avoid) instead of anemones, and the touch pools for the rays are uneventful since all of the rays pile on an unreachable wall. They have crabs and urchins in the tide pools, but what person is not completely fascinated by an anemone closing around his or her finger? I also understand that maybe some people have never been to a beach and have never seen kelp; however, I think people are naturally more intrigued by interacting with animals that acknowledge his or her touch than relatively inanimate plants. I LOVED the wave simulator. Very cool. I may have gotten the chills the first time I stood under it. I also was privy to seeing an audio tour guide feed some trout in an open air enclosure... wait, were those piranhas? Either way they were feisty as heck! Overall, the aquarium will take about 2.5 to 3 hours to slowly navigate depending on the nature videos and feedings. It is nice to see on our vacation, but I can't say I will be back until we have little kidlins of our own. Side note: The best part was buying our goldendoodle puppy, Mara, a little Octopus tug toy named Elton in the gift shop. It is the cutest thing I've ever seen... besides Mara. Since we couldn't bring her to the aquarium, we brought some aquarium back to her. #obsessivedogparents"
557,2019-02-26,1,"The aquarium is great for the most part, except there's toxic mold in the area where the giant octopus is as well as in one of the bottom floor exhibits. I react every time I'm in those areas and get sick for the rest of the day after visiting. Never going back."
558,2019-07-22,4,"The aquarium is nice and the education and the conservation message is critical, as well as the message that all of these amazing animals are out there and human activity is very significant and often detrimental.  But this aquarium is reallly expensive for a family to go to.  A typical American family cannot afford the price, which means less of the public going and being educated about the ocean. And after the hefty admission the mediocre food inside is ridiculous and unnnecessary priced... $over $55 for a shared skimpy amount of chicken tenders and many French fries, a burger and half soup/sandwich?  No kids meals.  This could be improved but at least your money is going to a good cause.  An option is to walk a few blocks to grocery store for much better priced food.The aquarium was uncomfortably packed, and difficult to enjoy each exhibit and view  the feedings at times.  But the exhibits are well done, amazing really.I applaud and am so thankful that this place exists and I do not blame the staff at the aquarium for the fees.  I think they should have more funding than they do and am glad to contribute.   Their work is under appreciated.  Really there should be many more aquariums to help sustain the planet, and more financial support to educate the public and research these critical issues."
559,2018-08-19,5,"Hadn't been back to the MBA since I was a little kid decades ago. Place is still as good as I remember. Exhibits are awesome and staff were always enthusiastic. Just make sure you arrive several minutes early before feedings; they get very crowded. Good thing they make sure that kids get to be in front for these events, so families will appreciate that."
560,2018-07-20,5,Haven't been here since I was 6 or 7. MyHusband and I took our little girl and she had a blast! It was super crowded though. We will come on a weekday next time!
561,2016-04-08,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is an amazing place to see life under the water. We started by getting there 10 minutes before they opened, which was a blessing because as the day progressed it got more and more crowded. Feeding time at the penguin area was crowded but manageable, the otter feeding was impossible. TIP: 20-30 min after the Otter feeding they give the Otters ice cubes and this is almost as fun as the feeding and there are way less people because it is not on the schedule.I miss the sting ray area that used to be there when I went as a kid. The splash zone is a great place for kids to get hands on with some sea life and there are structures and nooks & crannies designed especially for kids. Members get to enter the Aquarium a half hour before the public does. If I lived nearby or had the cash to donate I would definitely take advantage of this member perk. It all goes to a good cause."
562,2016-03-08,5,"I've been to this aquarium many times over and just visited again this past weekend.  We were here celebrating my sons 5th birthday and had a blast.  It's been a couple of years since I've visited and it seems as if they've had a few changes and added some new exhibits.  We went on a very rainy Saturday but the place was still very packed with lots of families and some cute couples on dates.  This place has so many different, amazing exhibits and lots of hand on experiences for the little ones.  You can end up spending all day here or walk around the entire place in a couple of hours. The exhibits include: a kelp forest, a giant pacific octopus, open sea, sea otters (my fave!), splash zone and penguins etc.  I love their open sea exhibit because you get to take a look at the bigger fish and they had a huge tortoise on the day of our visit.  Our little boy loved the splash zone because he can get his hands dirty and play with water.  We were so fortunate to witness a wild otter in their outside tide pool give birth to her baby otter.  It was an amazing experience!  And now my son shares his birthday with this adorable baby otter.  It was such a treat.  We also had a quick snack at their cafe which had a great selection.  At the information desk, we were able to get a Happy Birthday pin for our little boy.  He loved it and it's a great keepsake. This place is definitely a must do when you're in town!  We had a wonderful time.  I can't wait to return."
563,2019-08-16,5,"My family went two weeks ago while visiting Monterey, CA.  This aquarium offered so much educational and fun things to see.  It was worth every cent.  Be sure to allow at least 3 hours.  There are lots of attractions and shows to see."
564,2018-12-28,5,Love this place. We had our service dog and they treated us so wonderful. I was a bit hesitant because it was so busy but it was a great experience.
565,2018-06-11,5,"I loved this place when I came as a child and still love it as an adult! There's tons of things to see and interact with, and I think it's definitely the best aquarium in CA. Staff is very friendly and outgoing and they keep the place super clean.My boyfriend and I spent hours in awe, watching the beauty of marine-life in there. My favorite thing? PENGUINS! They are clumsy and adorable, and if I could have spent more time just watching them, I would have. (Boyfriend was bored of them after a while lol.)There's also some great souvenir shops to buy some sweet memorabilia for yourself or your kids!Super kid friendly, they even have a kids section upstairs for the little crazies that need to touch everything lol. And lots of stuffed animals you can buy!I would say take your kid here, but let's be real. You're the one who wants to go! Do it."
566,2018-04-08,4,"Okay, so now I am a member.  And my husband is a member.  We got hijacked into being members because being a member for a year is $75 and a one-time visit is $50.  Hopefully this is tax deductible since these prices are exorbitant. We defaulted to membership since I do believe in their cause - clean oceans, especially since I lived in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during my formative middle school year.  We were protected from the plastic detritus that is now awash all over the world by a mile wide lagoon with perfect turquoise water.  It was paradise, so I am now committed to saving that vision.  We did have one advantage with our membership, no waiting line for admission.We visited last October with my nephew and niece in tow, along with their two small children.  We went early Sunday morning on a sunny day, and got right in!!  We cruised the slate floors and enjoyed all the exhibits, especially the one where we could project camoflage patterns on our faces and take crazy photos of ourselves as concealed fish.We had arrived during a Baja festival, and were treated to Aztec dancers and flute music, as well as cooking demonstrations, which whipped up an appetite.  We got to every exhibit, and the kids especially enjoyed touching some of the critters on the second floor.  We had fun watching feeding time and viewing the open ocean.  The art in the Octopus exhibit was phenomenal and unusual.  The Mycenean octopus vase has always been a favorite of mine.  I also enjoyed the plastic bottles transformed into vases with a small heating gun and artistry.We stayed about three hours, and checked out by noon, when we thought it got crowded with family fun seekers like us.I decided to return when it might be less crowded, on a rainy Friday in April.   There must have been ten times the number of people that were there in October.  It was very hard to see the exhibits, and they had taken out the area where you could pet the critters.  We did enjoy being hypnotized by the open ocean, but all the other exhibits were the same as the exhibits six months ago and much less accessible because of the crowds.  I have an issue with the design of the place.  Having visited so many museums world wide, I noticed that here the public spaces are huge, and the exhibits are comparably small and hard to walk through, especially with so many strollers.  If they are going to charge so much, which really does amount to what an art museum charges for a donation or enhanced membership, there should be some member area for easier viewing.  The outdoor areas have lovely views, but need more seating and shade areas. It is a fabulous scholarly site, doing its best to educate a huge populace, and I do applaud their work.  The location is excellent for ocean study, and the mission is laudable.  It is currently well designed to hold the interest of children and families, and provide an education an experience for all."
567,2019-08-12,4,"There's no doubt that Monterey Bay Aquarium is beautiful. The variety of animals on view is far greater than all other aquariums I have visited in the past. However, I could not give this experience 5 stars because  I was a bit disappointed that some animals mentioned on the website as ""on exhibit"" were not present, but rather represented through pictures or fake replicas of the animal. Some of these are the flapjack octopus, black-eyed squid, and fang tooth fish from the Mission To The Deep exhibit; and the nautilus and squid from the Tentacles exhibit. Although it makes sense that it would be impossible to keep these animals in an aquarium(as they live deep underwater and would require some sort of high pressure system), it still was a bit disappointing since the website had gotten me excited to see them. Overall, it's a great aquarium, just be aware that not all animals listed on the website are represented with a live animal, but rather a fake."
568,2018-03-05,2,"Monterey Bay Aquarium was talked up as _the_ premiere aquarium in NorCal, if not the country, so naturally I came in with sky-high hopes. My previous experiences with aquariums were the Shedd in Chicago and the Georgia Aquarium, two phenominal experiences.My friends and I rented a car, took the beautiful scenic route down Highway 1, then bought tickets on our phones in line, skipping it entirely (lol). Which, by the way, were quite pricey. For something that I literally said ""that's it?"" about a minute earlier when I first saw it, I sure spent a lot of money to get in.Once I was in, I can say I was whelmed. There was a decent bit to see, and we did spend a few hours there, but nothing really stood out as amazing. Two weeks later, I can't really recall anything that really surprised me or stood out as unique. I'm taking off a star because $50 is about twice as expensive as the place is worth.The gorgeous drive down and watching the sunset at Pebble Beach were much more memorable, honestly. Do those instead."
569,2017-06-07,5,"Loved it as a kid, now taking my own daughter is absolutely amazing. So much interactive things and up close and personal tanks. I think my favorite room was the Open Sea. LARGE wall full of fish! The room itself was huge I could let daughter crawl around and enjoy the sea turtles and sharks. Jelly fish tanks are ALWAYS A1. I can't wait to come back later on down the road with our family again. And to end the trip around the aquarium, the children's center and baby splash area was great to get those wiggles out and top off the day. Always a great time!"
570,2016-05-09,4,"We came here since we were in the Monterey. This is my second time here and like the first go around i went straight to the jelly fish area because to simply put it...Jellyfishes are awesome! When we arrived the garage was completely full and this only left us to find a 2 hour parking spot on the streets which frankly, if i'm paying 40.00/ea to get in i want to stay more than 2 hours. Word to the wise come here as early as possible! you'll find great parking, you'll get to see the aquarium in it's entirely (the animals probably will feel less threatened or less likely to hide from you due to the high human traffic) You can also snap all the picture you want without people jumping in your shot or hitting your camera by mistake.This is a really nice aquarium especially since they've added a lot more things since the last time i was here. They also have amazing sculptures of sea creatures using trash that are found in our everyday oceans and other bodies of water and it does give great exposures as to how much pollutants we put in our waters that harm sea life. Seems that the main focus in this aquarium is sustainability which is a great message.Like i said come here early because as soon as 12pm rolls in you'll see that it is nearly impossible to take closer looks at smaller tanks and everyone is tunneling out in nearly exhibits (make sure you watch out for your kids!) so, come early check everyone out and once the crowd start coming in you can sit and enjoy the large takes with bigger fish, sea turtles, sharks, etc."
571,2018-04-29,4,"Before coming here I always heard that this place is very big and there's plenty to see. But honestly I felt like it didn't live up to my expectation as what people have told me or what I've heard from others. I still give this place 4 stars because it was still very cool and fun with the people you go with. I enjoyed my time here we spent at least 2 hours walking around, looking at everything, and taking pictures. The outside view is breath taking of the water and what's surrounding it. I would still definitely recommend going here because overall it's just a fun time to explore around this place."
572,2017-10-14,5,"By far my absolute favorite aquarium. I could sit for hours watching the jellyfish as they float magically against the blue backdrop. I had not been here in years so I was expecting the bench where you could sit and watch. I was disappointed it was gone but watching everyone waking around with their head in their cell phones made me think someone probably tripped over it. It's too bad people just Film the jellyfish and don't take the time to just BE and enjoy the relaxing experience of just watching them. The aquarium also had an intriguing art exhibit where various artists uses recycled material to create their visions. Really interesting. As of the writing of this review there is an exhibit called ""Tentacles"" which has octopus, nautilus and varied other delightful creatures. The docent said to look for the seahorses but I was unable to find them. TONS of screaming children. Go midweek if you can. When you are done with the beauty of nature, Cannery Row and it's restaurants and tchotchke-filled shops are a few steps away."
573,2017-07-16,5,"Popular for a reason, definitely a must-see if in the area. Amazing exhibits and very knowledgeable and friendly staff. We had guest member passes and were able to enter 30 minutes before the general public. This gave us a chance to see the otters and the jellyfish exhibits before they were mobbed with people. The Baja exhibit they have right now is gorgeous. We didn't catch the otter feeding, opting for an early front row seat at the open sea feeding instead. This was definitely my favorite part of our visit. Watching the schooling fish tornado was very cool. Would probably visit again in spite of the high ticket prices."
574,2018-06-24,5,"This is a very beautiful aquarium. Probably the first one I've ever been to growing up. It has captivated me ever since. Finally took my whole family back again. It's way better than ever!  Students young and old gets a discount. Bring, or show any proof you are a student. Food inside is pricey. Bathrooms are clean. Looks like you can now sign up to do some scuba diving in a controlled environment.  Still love this place."
575,2017-09-08,5,"If you're in the area, you must come here!! Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of my favorite places in Northern California.Disclosure: every time I have been here, I've used guest passes (comes with the apartment we rented) that allow you to go through a special entrance, so I haven't had to deal with the long lines.Anyways, the facility is clean, and even when it gets crowded, it somehow feels like you have the space to look at everything.The animals here are beautiful. My favorite exhibit is of course the sea otters. I could literally sit there all day watching them swim around. During feeding, we stayed on the first level and the view was just fine.I love all the interactive learning and the interesting blurbs they write out. The special exhibits are also pretty cool."
576,2017-02-20,5,"We really love the Monterey Bay Aquarium just not on holiday weekends.  It's a great place to visit and our kids really enjoy coming here but wanted to give all those reading this a couple of pro tips.Pro tip 1: Get to the aquarium early and find parking.  If you come after 1:00 PM you'll either be parking super far or having to park in 60 min to 90 min parking.  Trust me, all the paid parking fills up so try to come early to get the longer street parking that's closer to the aquarium.Pro tip 2: If you plan to make a return appearance in the future, buy the membership.  It makes all sorts of financial sense. The best benefit is the members entrance so you don't have to wait in.Pro tip 3: If you have small kids bring your own lunch or try to find a place to eat outside of the aquarium.  Remember to get your hand stamped so that you can come back in.  If you eat at the aquarium's restaurant you'll pay a small fortune for food but that's not the worst of it.  On a busy day, you'll need to hover around the tables (similar to vultures) in order to get a table.  Finding a table is always a struggle on busy days.Pro tip 4: if you have small kids watch out for overly aggressive tweens, teens and adults that come to this place.  There have been some times where my five year old has had to fight the twenty year old on his date for viewing space.  Don't get me started about the photographers that use their flashes on exhibits that say don't use flash.  Just watch your kids.  Sometimes the little ones get pushed around because of the volume of people. Can you tell I'm a protective dad.  Pro tip 5: for all parents with small kids try to avoid the gift shop at the aquarium.  Don't get me wrong, this is almost an impossible task but you'll find that there are other stores around canary row that sell souvenirs for the kids at a better price.  We spent a ton on aquarium toys only to have my kids want the Pokemon stuffed animal a street down from the aquarium.There you have it.  Just a couple of tips to think about when you come visit.  Having moved to NorCal about a year ago, we're thankful that Monterey Bay Aquarium is only a couple of hours away!  It's a world-class aquarium and a great place to visit."
577,2017-04-30,5,"I always have fun at this place the earlier the better because of the crowds good parking averages about $15, watch out for people with strollers that can steer, they sometimes run over you or the other children running around. Overall very friendly environment, the people that work there are sweet."
578,2016-01-08,5,"Love this place.  Membership prices range from $50 for students to $300 for entire families and the family membership includes all family members and two transferable passes to be used by guests as well as invites to exclusive parties and events.  Not to mention unlimited entry to the Aquarium with no blackout dates.  This is a huge Aquarium with many exhibits and many scientists on staff on site.  Great for kids and those like me who are kids at heart.  I have been to other Aquariums before, like the one in Long Beach and found this one different and more to my liking.  Not as flashy and commercialized as Long Beach but more down to earth and kid friendly.  This Aquarium is basically split into two levels and an outdoor section.  You are right on the water here and can get out for some fresh air if the crowds get too busy.  Also, if you come on a non-holiday weekday it is wide open.   Be warned, it is expensive for non-members.  An adult ticket will run you $39 for the day and a kid is nearly $33.  Throughout the year they will also have a live great white shark in the huge open ocean tank.  This is my favorite part.  Unfortunately, presently no great white shark on display.  This is a great venue, plenty of reasonable parking, great restaurants and shops surrounded the facility, very clean and well kept, and plenty of staff on site to direct guests and answer questions.  Thank you Monterey Bay Aquarium."
579,2019-02-03,5,I have been going here since I was a childAnd now that I have moved to the area I seem to be going once a month The fish are so beautiful They look like happy and clean Even as an adult my breathe is still taken away by beauty of nature This aquarium lets you experience the natural beauty without letting you feel your looking at an oversized fish tank
580,2017-04-08,5,"If you only have one day to visit Monterey, or even a few hours, Monterey Bay Aquarium is the place to go. Otters, penguins, schools of fish, mesmerizing jellyfish are all there!Believe the hype; Monterey Bay Aquarium is the best aquarium I've seen. The photos posted here speak for themselves! Take it from the girl who grew up visiting Sea World in San Diego, visited San Francisco's Aquarium of the Sea, and lived in Monterey for a year and a half. I'd call it the ""San Diego Zoo of sea life.""The aquarium is located at the southernmost end of Cannery Row, so it is hard to miss. Admission prices are worth it as you get an amazing aquarium experience while helping sustain the aquarium with your payment. The aquarium occupies the building of the last surviving sardine cannery in Monterey, Portola Sardines. Visitors will experience storytelling of the rich history of Monterey's booming sardine industry in the early 20th century. The best time to visit is any day but a Saturday. Saturdays that fall on long weekends are especially crowded, including running, screaming children. I felt bad for my relatives who were visiting Monterey as we all visited the aquarium on the 4TH OF JULY in 2015! I also visited on a regular Sunday afternoon, and it was a calm, peaceful moment at the aquarium. With that said, I do not blame families for bringing their children here. All showcases include rich information on the aquarium's sea life which is incredibly beautiful to see. There is even a section just for kids to play in. Local elementary schools are blessed to have this site for field trips. The aquarium truly isn't just for show. The mini outdoor stadium is great because the centerstage is the actual Monterey Bay, so visitors can see otters up close in their natural element. During summer months, the aquarium holds a nightly ""Summer Nights at the Aquarium"" event. If you come at the right time, you may be able to witness the live birth of an otter pup. The aquarium is an advocate of sustainability, with themes of eating sustainable seafood spread around. A gift shop and a surprisingly decent snack bar are located toward the entrance and exit doors. Aquarium staff members are all friendly and knowledgeable.I highly recommend a stroll along Cannery Row after your aquarium visit. An added bonus is walking along the Monterey Recreational Trail to visit Old Fisherman's Wharf and historic Downtown Monterey."
581,2019-01-05,4,Parking is rough but once you get inside is awesome. Really big and amazing exhibits. Really great experience
582,2019-02-11,5,Just went back after 10 years. Last time I came I was maybe 12 years old. Forgot how amazing the place is. I'd say the place mostly caters to children but definitely it's still a place for people of all ages to go! They have a great staff who are passionate and informative about marine life. What the actual facility does for marine life conservation is incredible. If you have a day off to learn and explore this is it!
583,2016-01-04,5,"It's all about the jellies, but the otters are cool too. This might be the best way to spend a day on California coast and not even touch the beach sand, but that depends on far you lean into the tide pools. The Monterey Bay aquarium will blow you ocean-loving mind, from giant Yellowfin Tuna, Hammerhead sharks to fluffy sea otters and actually sitting inside of a crashing wave made with real ocean water, and the best part is you don't even get wet. The aquarium also has penguin feedings, open sea feedings, and a opportunity to sit in on some special educational ""fish talks"" in the kelp forests or in their auditorium which also showcases, Great White Shark video presentations, a ""Behind The Glass"" look at the aquarium, and a chance to stare at the cutest damn thing here, ""Luna"" the sea otter.  Make sure you check show times on the handy venue map  that you get once you arrive. This place is definitely crowded, but that's because it's awesome. When you host multiple sea creatures, help preserve the oceans, and your facility is attached to a live tide pools just outside the backdoor, duh, of course people are going to come here in droves. I noticed that a few reviews mentioned the price as being one of the cons to the aquarium, but $40 isn't bad when you realize that your money is keeping the aquarium and its conservation efforts alive. I don't really see Mickey & Goofy doing that with their $98 base ticket price.  One thing you must do, if you're running short on time, is the check-out the jelly fish tanks and then walk into in the Open Sea tank area, it's massive and truly a sight for the little ones."
584,2018-03-30,5,"An experience that's a must when you visit Monterey, CA! Amazing and helpful employees that really love their jobs!"
585,2015-12-23,5,"The story goes my mom once had a business trip to Monterey and went to the local aquarium. She was so enamored with the place, she brought back a brochure to NYC for her two sons to see. My older brother was so fascinated he brought the brochure in for show and tell.  Since then my brother and I always spoke of visiting the Monterey aquarium.  Now after 37 years I finally made it.  Perhaps part of it was sentimental, but to say the least the visit was magical. The uniqueness of Monterey is partly its incorporation with the natural oceanfront. There is a tide bay where you can watch the waves ripple in.  You can also see numerous tanks actively pumping the ocean water directly into the tank.  This is also an educational visit with fascinating exhibits about conserving the environment and the release of rescued marine life. What also sets Monterey apart from other aquariums was the staff and facilities.   Pristine.  Fantastic food. Friendly greetings. And impromptu teaching sessions.  I wondered aloud at the octopus tank (Is that a gill?) and a friendly employee overheard.  She happily answered my question (yes, it uses it to propel it through the water like a pump) and a few questions more afterwards.  The most breathtaking exhibit is beyond words.  It's a massive tank with a brilliant school of sardines.  The scintillation of lights are mesmerizing as they drift through the tank.  My brother tells me there is an overnight sleepover next to this tank.  Sign me up!!!I also had to drag my wife out of the gift store kicking.  I hope the next time we come back we will have ample time to explore the neighborhood.  Monterey looks absolutely charming."
586,2018-07-03,5,Awesome! Great experience. Lots of new and exciting things to see. Best of you go at the times they do the feedings. My daughter was glued.  She absolutely loved it.
587,2019-07-31,5,"I love going here. The otters are so cute but please note that this is a big tourist attraction. Be prepared for tons of people on holidays, summer and when an exhibit changes."
588,2019-01-26,5,This place gives the most interactive and wonderful experience for any kid! Mine loved it! And we'll continue to come
589,2019-07-13,5,"Probably the best aquarium I've been able to visit. We've enjoyed it so much so that we've gone twice. The space is large, plenty of outside space to take in the scenery of the bay. Just make sure to either come early during season or try to come during the off season."
590,2019-07-27,5,Such a great location and exhibits   I loved the sea otters. The depth of exploration for the size is quite inspiring
591,2019-07-27,2,It's ok at best. Kind of boring. There is very little interaction with any animals. I mean cmon $50 for just that. I could have went to Disneyland for a few more $.
592,2015-12-29,4,"My first job ever was at this Aquarium and I have been back many times since. Even though I have seen many of the exhibits already, I always feel a sense of wonder and magic while watching the brilliant sea life all around me. Also, I love seeing the new exhibits and activities that make the experience even more enjoyable. Some of my favorite displays are the playful otters, cute penguins, beautiful jellyfish, brightly colored fish of hot pink/electric blue and yellow etc, mystical kelp forest, school of fish forming shapes together, formidable sharks, majestic sea turtles and the fact that the Aquarium is connected to the natural ocean front and there are outdoor areas throughout where you can witness the amazing views of the Monterey Bay/Pacific Ocean. There's a fun new feature at the Tentacles exhibit where you can make a ""Cephalopod Selfie,"" by sitting down and make faces as you choose your disguise, then the whole video is shown on the big screen and you can have it emailed to you. I also really like that there are a ton of interactive and educational exhibits, such as the Enchanted Kelp Forest Touch Pool where you can touch many plants and animals that live in the kelp forest habitat, including sea stars, abalones, sea urchins, kelp crabs and more.There are also games at the Kelp Forest, as well as a whole area of cool activities for children to enjoy at Splash Zone, where the penguins are housed.At $39.95 for general admission, the price is a bit high (I remember when it was only $20), but definitely worth it to check it out at least once and if you are a Monterey resident, you can enter for free certain times during the year (which I did)... Just bring your ID card/proof of residence."
593,2016-01-03,5,"For almost a year now, my 4-year old and I have had season passes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  We go down every month or two and always have a blast.  Yes, it's a bit of a drive from South Bay but in the end, we always think the drive was worth it (especially when we stop at Gizdich Ranch for fruit, cider or pie and Randy's Sandwich shop for their amazing, inexpensive subs (closes at 2pm, cash-only))!My son has learned so much and it's been fascinating to watch him change in the year we've been going.  At first, he only wanted to play and run back and forth.  While that was fun, I appreciate that he now likes to watch the movies, too, giving me a small break from running a playing.  He can now quote facts about sea otters, octopus, sea life, and more.  We've developed our little routine, which involves every room in the place, plus a soup at the cafe.  Then sometimes, if the sun is still up, we go to one of the beaches just south of the aquarium.  Once, we even got to watch all the whales off the coast of Pacific Grove (in Nov, I think).I'd like to request that the cafe keep the carrot ginger soup all year round, though.  It's my little boys most favorite thing in the world and they only had butternut last visit. haha Just kidding - he'll live (though he didn't even finish half of the butternut soup).In all seriousness, we'd recommend the aquarium, Pacific Grove beaches, and Cannery Row to anyone.  It's a fun daytrip!Insiders Tip - Members can enter on the side entrance, which helps skip the lines.See ya there!"
594,2017-07-06,5,"We recently spent a couple of days in Monterey. A visit to the aquarium was a highlight of our stay.Other aquariums are bigger, have more diversity of species and are more majestic. Like Atlanta, for instance. But Monterey is an excellent, well laid out sanctuary for our friends of the sea. Lots of interesting exhibits. Lots of well informed docents available to answer questions. Unlike other aquariums, Monterey backs up to a marine sanctuary. You can stand on the back deck and watch sea otters, sea lions and a great mix of seabirds going about their business in the wild. Good stuff.We're very glad we went."
595,2017-07-05,4,"I love love love that this is a non-profit place and all about sustainability. Although, I do have to say it's not as large and amazing as I remember it being when I was a kid. Very packed. Still a good time though - just not as much time for the money as it once was."
596,2017-07-05,5,"Welll just got our yearly family membership.  It's a bit expensive if you come here just once.  Prices are $50 per adult.  You can get discounts from the AAA website for $5 off each admission but you have to do that before you get to the aquarium.  You can also get Senior and student discounts so take advantage of those.  Benefits of being a member is going thru the member entrance since lines can get long in the regular entrance.  It sure was long on the 4th of July weekend.  I love the water movement here.  The touch pool are a great place and the deeper aquarium with the sharks and the moving fish schools are so awesome.  It's like being a kid again.  I would've loved to see more otters, as they are amazing.  We'll have to come back at least 2x now so looking forward to it"
597,2017-07-04,3,"This is a 5 star aquarium in many ways, particularly in the research and rescue work they do.  We are scuba divers so i have always been opposed to fish tanks and zoos but i recognize that this is for most of us this this world, one of the best and for some, the only educational platforms where you can come close to and learn about some fascinating species that live in our planet earth.I was very glad to see a few unique creatures like the Nautilus and very large seahorses - so rare to see them in big sizes in the nature. I do not think it warrants the steep ticket price it charges for what it offers - compare to many other aquariums I have visited around the world.  In addition, because it stressed so much on education, i feel the highly priced tickets limits the opportunity for many who could not afford it. We were blessed to be able to bring our family and maybe local schools organize field trips for their resident school going kids at a discounted rate. However, for the the usual tourist, with the many activities this town has to offer, I can see how parents with 3 or 4 kids passing this up knowing this will be a few hundred dollars one-day-trip.  If we return Monterrey again - which i do for my business - I will not visit here again, especially without my children."
598,2018-04-02,5,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium, some of my favorites are the jellyfish, the deep sea and the otters. They have scheduled feeding times for the otters where they put on a ""show"". I definitely recommend arriving 30 minutes before the feeding or you will be standing in the back which makes it very difficult to enjoy."
599,2018-06-26,5,"We've been coming here since it first opened decades ago.  Each visit has something new to explore.  It's an all day adventure for us.  We're looking forward to bringing the grandkids when we host the family in Monterey for our 50th anniversary in a few years.Parking has gotten to be an issue.  Be sure to car pool.  Better yet, park in a downtown garage and take the new shuttle.  When we visited last year, we stayed a few miles away in Pacific Grove and rode our bikes.  The cheap all day lockers and free bike racks just across from the entry made this a breeze!"
600,2019-07-08,5,Extraordinary experience.  Both educational and entertaining.  Enough different things going on so you have choices.
601,2018-05-28,4,"So I been here a million times, it's nice it's big the food is good, but man don't go on a weekend you will be uncomfortable. Everyone is hoggin up the glass to see the clownfish and the jellys as usual. Also it's expensive I recommend buying online to beat the line."
602,2019-01-20,5,Gone here since I was really young. Have so many different exhibits and sea animals. I never run out of things to do here.
603,2018-03-06,2,"I think underwhelmed is the correct word here. As a veteran of several ""smaller"" aquariums, I've always held this belief in my mind that Monterey was the granddaddy of them all. Well, we finally made it up for a visit, and uh, hmmmmm. I've seen everything Monterey has, and a lot of things it doesn't have, at much MUCH smaller aquariums that weren't RIGHT ON THE OCEAN! I understand that conservation efforts and everything else are what's most important, but from a strictly road weary tourist standpoint, this aquarium didn't deliver at all."
604,2017-01-19,4,"If you're thinking about visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium, then look no further because I can say with all my heart that this aquarium is DEFINITELY worth a few hours of your time. Like what a lot of Yelpers have said in their reviews/tips, the Monterey Bay Aquarium isn't going to be the nicest aquarium you will ever see in your life. The number of sea animals you will encounter here isn't going to be at the same magnitude as what you would experience at places such as Sea World or Long Beach's Aquarium of the Pacific. And the number of ""Ooohs and Aaahs"" probably won't be as great here as if you visited SF's Exploratorium. BUT, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is indeed worth a visit.Ticket prices can range from $30-$50 a person. This is indeed very expensive, more than most animal attractions. You can get discounts if you are a student ($40 a ticket) or if you visit a NorCal Triple A branch location. My friends and I kept our student ID's and used that for the discount. You can either buy tickets online or in person - the line isn't that long in person - but know you will have to show ID if you have a discount. I recommend coming early in the morning so that you can nab some free parking a few streets down where the residential areas are and that you can get through the aquarium before lunch, giving you time to check out the other stuff in Monterey. You can easily go through the entire park in a few hours and you can actually come back the same day with a stamp. I believe the shows are more toward the afternoon so if you want to see those (they're 15 minute lecture style shows-kind of boring) come in the afternoon.Overall, the aquarium isn't too big. There's only about 2 floors, packed with different exhibits ranging from the deep sea, to a Baja California section, to even a space outside where you can look through telescopes. If you have kids, they'll LOVE the splash zone where you can touch tidepool creatures and get wet. Some noteworthy exhibits to visit are (from what I remember) the jellyfish section and the open sea. There are plenty of places where you can literally just sit on a bench and watch marine animals swimming around. In terms of gift shops, this aquarium has like 2-3 different stores to keep you busy with one big one that includes a collection of books. Plus, there's a few restaurants too (not your typical Taco Bell chains).I loved going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I definitely had a wonderful time. Do I think it's worth it? Sure. Do I think it's a bit overpriced? Definitely. Come with some discounts and you won't regret visiting the aquarium. Have fun and prosper,"
605,2019-08-04,5,"I have been to many world class aquariums, but none of them hold a candle to this one.  I am a member and will be for many years to come.  The aquarium goes to extreme measures bringing aboard retirees and decent teens from the community to be employees.  It's incredible how they change up their exhibits every few years to keep things fresh.  If you've only been once or you've been a million times, you know this is like the Disneyland of aquariums.  The standard is so high, all the competition looks silly and second tier.  It does get incredibly packed during the summer and on weekends though.  This is my only gripe.  Give it a go!"
606,2015-11-08,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) is currently ranked as the #2* aquarium in the US and the #3** Aquarium in the world, per travel site Tripadvisor.com. It's a fantastic place that my family and I have been going to for years, and has always been my top choice to take out-of-town guests. However, the MBA is more than a great place to come see some fish; for over 30 years they've been one of the world leaders in the field of Marine Science, and specialize in conservation through education and research of our world's oceans. It's nice to know that your admission isn't lining the wallet of some fat cat, but going towards a good cause. Admission- I highly recommend buying your tickets to visit the MBA ahead of time**** because it helps you skip the lines and just sashay on in. Also, if you're a credit union member (or veteran) you can save a few bucks (±$4/ea) on tickets; check with your CU, or look and purchase through their website like I did. It isn't much of a cost savings, but it'll most likely pay for your parking in Cannery Row.Best Times to Visit: If you go during the weekends or holidays the MBA is a complete zoo of people, and I would not recommend taking really young toddlers that are learning to walk--because they will get trampled. I've found the most enjoyable time to visit is on a random weekday --which I know is not always possible-- but it is what it is.Features- There's waaaaay too much good stuff to see at the MBA, and lord knows I'm verbose enough, so I'll summarize it with a Top 5 list, à la David Letterman:5) The MBA always has changing exhibits, and their current one titled, ""Tentacles"" is pretty awesome. They have an array of Cephalopods to excite any Mollusk lover! 4) The 40' Touch pool inside the Enchanted Kelp Forest area is a ""must-go"" for anyone with young kids, or for those that love a more tactile experience. Starfish, Abalones, Sea Urchins, and Rays (Oh, my!) are just a few of the many things you'll get to touch and feel.3) The Sandy Shore and Aviary is another can't miss for anyone who loves birds. Here you'll get about as close as possible to lots of shorebirds in a simulated marshland and watch them do their thing. It's a bit bittersweet since the reason most of these birds are in this exhibit is because they're too injured to be released back into the wild. 2) The Jellyfish Exhibit is a mesmerizing display of all things Jelly. The colors of the Jellies and the lighting is so beautiful and magnificent that you can't help but fall in love with those squishy balls of goo!1) The Open Sea exhibit is mind-blowing, mesmerizing and a bit surreal... It's a gigantic One Million --yes, you read that right!-- gallon tank with a 90' window that allows you to view a massive array of fish, sharks and turtles swimming around.  If there's one exhibit I could sit and watch for hours, this would be it. They even have stadium seating up top, for those that want to take it all in. It's pretty unreal.I could expound for hours on my love for all things MBA, but I think you get the point. Also, be sure to check out some of their live feedings*** at various exhibits while you're there. So, what are you doing just sitting there?!? Get out that Credit Card and buy some tickets already, would you? You won't regret it. *tripadvisor.com/Traveler…**tripadvisor.com/Traveler…***montereybayaquarium.org/…****tickets.montereybayaquar…"
607,2015-11-17,5,"Something's FISHY.When my brother suggested a short trip to Monterey on our recent California vacation, my only request was:  ""Can we please go to the aquarium?"".  Thankfully, that was one of the places he wanted to show my mother and I (he had visited the aquarium on a past trip).I will say that visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium was definitely worth the time and effort, as we all enjoyed the exhibits and surroundings immensely.LOCATION:  Cannery Row.  The aquarium sits on a corner at one end opposite from shops and restaurants.  NOTE:  My brother purchased tickets online with pick up at will-call.  $39.95 per adult.  Not sure if there are any fees associated with online purchase.  Also, I'm not sure of the parking availability as we parked in one of the Cannery Row garages and walked over to the aquarium.For more information including location, hours and exhibits, please visit:montereybayaquarium.orgThe aquarium is comprised of two floors, and we took our time exploring the exhibits on both levels:1ST:  Favorites included the kelp forest, aviary, the touch pools, and the sea otters.  The kelp forest, honestly, was such a spectacle to behold.  Towering kelp encased in gigantic glass tanks as various species of fish swam around in this man-made natural habit.  It was very cool.  The aviary and touch pools were a definite highlight as visitors are allowed to interact with the sea life up close and personal, so to speak.  I truly enjoyed the aviary as it was a cheerful environment with natural light and sand and water elements.  The touch pools were a delight certainly.......to the many, many, many children that were present on the day of our visit.  The sting rays were very popular indeed.  And interestingly enough, like the many children, I too was excited for wave crash exhibit, where 600 gallons of water are pumped to simulate waves crashing.  The walk-thru tunnel was a nice touch as well.I was in awe of the sea otters.  There's signage at this exhibit to introduce the various otters to visitors.  Names and ages are posted.  This exhibit made me smile as the otters looked like they were having lots of fun swimming around and about in their tank.2ND:  Stand out exhibits included the jellyfish, the open sea, and the penguins.  One of the most impressive displays is above the entrance to the jellyfish exhibit.  There are hundreds and hundreds of either sardines or anchovies (sadly, I forgot which species) swimming altogether in formation that could only be described as unforgettable and smartly presented.The jelly fish exhibit was pretty awesome.  The various species of jellyfish on display included purple-striped jelly, sea nettle, crystal jelly, moon jelly, and egg yolk jelly.  Although each variety of jelly fish were housed in their own tank, the sea nettle jelly were given the largest display; no doubt to showcase their various shape and size, as well as their lengthy body type.Further exploring the second floor, we came upon the penguin exhibit.  And thankfully, we were just in time to witness their afternoon feeding time program.  The staff involved with this activity were very organized, as they directed spectators/visitors who were closer to the penguin habitat to sit on the tile floor as to not obstruct the view for others, as well as kindly asking others to sit on the available benches.  It was further explained that the penguins at the aquarium were from Africa, and that penguins reside in different parts of the world other than Antarctica.  While the feeding was ongoing, there was also a question and answer segment as well.  Lastly, the open sea exhibit was absolutely amazing.  Gazing at the 90 foot window display, visitors can ooh and ahh and point out the various inhabitants in the tank.  These include shark, tuna, sea turtles, and schools of sardines.  The display was truly mesmerizing as it allowed visitors to observe all of these creatures of the sea and the interactions with their own species as well as others.  I think the sardines captured my attention the most as schools of sardines were swimming about in a synchronized formation.  The open sea was truly wondrous.Before departing, we all went out on the outdoor deck to take photos and just to observe the scenery in the distance, the bay, as well as the outdoor life surrounding the aquarium.  side NOTE:  Apart from the main shop on the first floor, there are various gift shops in located in different parts of the aquarium as well.  There's also cafe on the first floor as well.BOTTOM LINE:  An afternoon well spent at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  This is one place any visitor to Monterey should put on their list of places to visit for sure.  Definitely recommended."
608,2015-11-06,5,"This was my second time visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium since 1991, and much has changed. I went on a Thursday, which I expected to be more of a slow day, but when we arrived, it was majorly busy. There are so many new exhibits here and the inside looks much improved. The first exhibit I visited were the sea otters. These are some of the cutest animals on earth. There was one that caught my attention by doing the back stroke in circles and continued to swim by the window, as if he was showing off for the tourist. What a HAM!!! The other exhibits included some touch pools were you can feel crabs and other marine life with your bare fingers. They had penguins, beautiful schools of fish, a tentacle area where you can view many type of octopuses (whom love to hide in the corners where you cannot see them), and so much more. I loved to watch the sweet otters, but my favorite place was the Open Sea, which is a dark room with an illuminated aquarium view as large as an IMAX screen. The tank itself, I believe, is a couple hundred tons of water, and houses a variety of sharks and thousands of fish. There is a little balcony in the back where you can sit in dark privacy and enjoy the view. This is a marvelous ambiance with some soft new age music in the background. I was so relaxed, that I could have fallen asleep.The smell of the ocean is wondrous and I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy the waters. I admire the dedication and effort that goes into taking care of so many creatures. I have much appreciation for this aquarium, and I am already making plans to go back in a few months!!"
609,2018-04-30,4,"Visited the Aquarium once again for our final time for a while (annual family membership just ran out).  Absolutely love this aquarium - the exhibits are wonderful and educational.   There is a good mix of entertainment and education for the kids.   Our boys always learn a lot and have fun :).   We usually challenge them to learn 5 new facts and share to earn lunch (I know, I know, we are slave drivers :)).  We always have great quality family time when we go spending tons of time in the Open Sea and other exhibits just admiring marine life and reading about the creatures and conversation.   Their seminars are also entertaining and very informative.   We love doing the trip to the Aquarium and surrounding areas as a day trip from the bay area.   This place is especially good for parents with young children as they have exhibits geared towards toddlers and the like and plenty of opportunities to view and touch the various marine life."
610,2017-06-03,5,"Went Memorial Day weekend on a Sunday.Parking: Parked in a lot a couple blocks up hill. Easy walk down and even back up. Flat rate for all day parking. Street parking is 4 hour parking and we knew we'd be in the aquarium for longer than that so we opted for the flat rate lot parking.Tickets: Get tickets online before you get to the aquarium! It makes it faster for you to get inside. There are certain discounts for military/students/etc just make sure to have ID! The work that the aquarium does and the facility itself is so well maintained that I was fine paying the slightly pricey entrance fee. Food: We had lunch at the cafe/restaurant in the aquarium and pricing-wise it's what you would expect from an attraction restaurant. Food was pretty good! A good tip is that if you get a fountain drink, you pay once then can keep getting refills essentially throughout the day, just make sure to keep your receipt and show it to the cashier!Animal Feeding: It's good to keep track of what animal feedings you want to go to. Make sure to get to them around 30 mins earlier to get a good spot, especially for the otters. For the penguins, there was enough space that people in the front sat on the floor and then people in the back stood so that the max amount of people could see what's going on. For the otters, there isn't as much space on their upstairs viewing deck so you definitely need to get up to the glass early to be able to see.The aquarium isn't the biggest but I really like the layout! The map is easy to follow and there are so many helpful volunteers around the whole place that can help you if you need! We went right when it opened and there weren't as many people as the afternoon, when we left."
611,2018-07-20,5,"Wow, this place is amazing! At first I felt worried for the fish and sea animals because they have to be trapped in this aquarium and just have to be stared at by viewers. But, they actually keep them to help save the endangered and hurt animals. They take them in as injured animals and keep them in their facility as long as they need and let them back into their own nature when they are able to take care of them selves!! The favorite part was the open sea where you are able to see the glowing jellyfish and the fishes and sharks in all of their glory! They also have an amazing gift shops with the CUTEST stuffed animals and clothes!! They have he cutest otters that play with toys and are SUCH show offs! This is SUCH a family friendly place and right in the middle of Cannery Row! Had a blast!"
612,2018-04-10,5,"I loves visiting the aquarium. I thought it was expensive at first, almost $100 for two people, but then I realized that they are a non profit and it takes a ton of money to keep the place going. I lovvvvvved the sea otters. Totally kittens of the sea. The jelly fish were amazing. If we lived near here we would have gotten the membership."
613,2019-01-01,4,"was really cute, only down side was the price & amount of people that were there , it was crowded and i could barley get to see things without squeezing my way through ."
614,2015-10-20,5,"So for the record, I am actually from Monterey (So there may be a tad bit of bias with this review LOL), and if you are familiar with the Monterey Peninsula, the Aquarium is one of the main attractions out here.We decided that visiting this place on a weekday would be ideal, and sure enough it was the BEST time to come here! We were able to park on the street, which had a meter that covers you for 4 hours at $6. That is the best deal you will find here as the other lots and parking garages will charge you anywhere from $10-$20. If you are fascinated by marine animals, this place is definitely for you! I'd say toddlers probably have more fun vs. teens, but the atmosphere is very conducive to relaxation. We found ourselves just sitting in front of these massive tanks, staring at sharks, jelly fish, and bat rays. There is a nice looking restaurant/cafe' in the aquarium (Cindy's Waterfront), but we opted to walk down the Cannery Row strip, to snack and indulge in snacks and junk food. Probably not the healthy thing to do, but it was fun.Side note:If you want to watch the diver feed the sharks, that happens at 11:30AM and 4:00PM (15 minutes long)Conclusion:It is definitely a great place to visit, but be prepared to drop $39.95 for adult admission. If you have a child under 3 years old, they are free! :)"
615,2016-02-26,5,"I love it here so much I had to become a member. The work they do here is amazing, the research they do is so very important. I also think it teaches children to learn about our oceans and to respect it for its preservation."
616,2018-12-28,5,"I always love visiting the Aquarium. I believe in their mission and each time I leave  I feel more motivated to make a change in my life to help keep our oceans healthy & thriving. My heart swells knowing the people working and volunteering there continue to push the boundaries to advance the aquariums mission!  Thank you, Monterey Bay Aquarium and all it's supporters"
617,2017-03-19,5,"There is a reason the Monterey Bay Aquarium is world famous, this place really is a highlight of a trip to Monterey.  Otters, jellyfish, sharks, octopus galore really everything you would hope for.  Big tanks for the giant kelp forest and the open ocean exhibit.  All of the fish are on display and living life.  The sardine room with the constantly circling schools is one of my favorites.  Make sure to check out the tentacle exhibit, it can be easy to overlook but has some of the best displays of octopi you'll ever come across in an aquarium.If you are lucky you might even have a chance to see some wile whales from one of the many outdoor viewing areas around the aquarium.  The staff will make announcements if there has been a spotting and direct you to the best viewing areas to see the sea.  Easy to get to the aquarium especially if you are staying on Cannery row. They don't open til 10, so don't wake up,early just to get here."
618,2017-05-30,5,"This is definitely not the biggest aquarium I've been in but I love the interactive features, the large number of volunteers who are always willing to help and answer questions, and the special exhibits!Go early just as the aquarium opens and you'll be able to have better picture taking opportunities, and also your kids will have more time to touch bat rays! I definitely want to be back for the sleepover!"
619,2017-09-28,5,"My experience at the Monterey Aquarium was amazing!! The marine wildlife is captivating and the marine staff are very informative. The staff were also super friendly and would invite you to explore and see everything.It's true, you can scroll through everything in the aquarium in about an hour or two, but what's the point in that? It's a 50$ admission per adult, take your time, really get to see everything and go to the feeding programs. I took pictures and videos till my phone couldn't take anymore. My visit lasted around 5 hours. It was simply awesome."
620,2019-01-11,4,Really cool aquarium! It's smaller than I had expected but if you go and stay all day and watch the feedings and shows it's pretty cool! Get there early parking is a hassle. Get to the feedings early it gets full fast!
621,2019-06-27,5,Absolutely loved this place ! We traveled from Orange County Ca to visit this place and it was worth it ! So much to see and plenty of walking !
622,2018-03-23,5,"This is the best aquarium in California. Experience is exquisite. Already visited this place so many times. Yes, the ticket is pricey. But its worth it. They do have a wide variety of exhibits which will blow your mind. Kelp forest, Open sea, Tentacles, Viva Baja, Penguins and touch pools. Each section is exciting and informative. You get to meet the rare species under the water. Open sea feeding, divers in the Kelp forest, penguin feeding at splash zone, otters playtime.. there are plenty of activities going on. Touch pools are real fun for the kids.."
623,2015-10-06,4,"Whale hello there, water you doing here? Come here often? No, probably not because aquarium tickets are expensiveeee. But very worth it! Plus you can find ways to get discounted tickets, for example if you have AAA or have a student ID. DEFINITELY PRINT TICKETS BEFORE HAND. At 10am, the line to get in is long, heck, even at like 9:30am its still pretty long filled with people waiting for it to open. If you print your ticket ahead of time, there's literally almost no line. Just walk up to the front, ignore all the jealous eyes following you thinking you're cutting, and you'll be directed to where to go if you already have a ticket. My favorite part is watching the sea animals be fed. Grab a schedule to see when and who is being fed so you have a chance to see them all. The open sea feeding is the most exciting in my opinion. My second favorite part is being able to touch the sting rays! THEY FEEL SO FUNNY I LOVE IT. I thought it would be hard and leathery or rubbery but NOPE. I can't even explain the feels, just go do it and see for yourself. ------------------------------------------T  I  P  S  :-PRINT TICKET AHEAD OF TIME AND SAVE YOURSELF AN HOUR OF WAITING-EAT ELSEWHERE, food is much expensive -THIS IS NOT WHERE THE SHARK/FISH TUNNEL IS (that's the CA Academy of Science, SF)-YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GO IN AND OUT OF THE AQUARIUM (when you leave the aquarium, there is a stand to STAMP your hand, this stamp allows in and out privileges ) -TOUCH ALL THE STARFISH AND STING RAYS-WATCH ALL THE SEA ANIMAL FEEDINGS-DO ALLLLL THE THINGS"
624,2018-07-10,5,"What's not to love! This is one of the most magical places, whether you're a child or an adult. There's so much to see, and the tanks are designed so well, that I could come every day and not get tired of the aquarium. Pricey but totally worth it"
625,2019-09-23,5,"awesome place to visit, nicest aquarium i have been too the animals look  very well cared for and the exhibits are beautiful, if you get there and are handicapped they have wheelchairs that you can ask to use also a big tip get to the area before they open because parking is hard to come by when they do"
626,2015-11-28,5,"I haven't been to an aquarium, unless you include Miami Seaquarium.  Sure, I've been to Seaworld in Florida and I've been to the Smithsonian Museum and other museums, but this was a treat.  Whether it was worth $39.95, plus parking, I'm not sure.Speaking of parking, there doesn't seem to be any.  I suppose when they created the aquarium, they weren't thinking of so many people having cars and trucks.  I ended up parking in a restaurant's lot for $10.00 at 3:30 p.m., though they charge $20.00 for the whole day.  Then again, it's Monterey, I wouldn't expect it to be inexpensive.The staff was friendly, sometimes informative.  Having 90 minutes to see the whole place wasn't enough to engage the staff in conversation.I kept making mental comparisons with Seaworld.  I'd photographed sea lions and their cubs, birds, seals, and quite a few other sea creatures.  Here, the selection seemed more limited.  Naturally, there were many fish and types of plant life.I don't know about anyone else, but seeing all the anchovies made me hungry.In the three story tank, there seemed to be a lot of agreeable wildlife.  Some of the fish and sharks seemed to crave attention, coming to the camera.Fortunately, for the area, most everything was indoors, with simulated environments for the penguins and such.It was all appropriately lit, and most everyone seemed respectful of the needs of the creatures.  They only had one area where you could touch a few creatures, which was enough, similar to Seaworld where I had a baby Sting Ray trying to eat my fingers.It is a good place for discovery and a quiet afternoon."
627,2018-02-23,4,"I finally got to visit the aquarium and see it for myself. After learning it was a staggering $50 per adult ticket, I wondered if it was worth it.We went on a Thursday during winter break, and I was happy to see there were no long lines to get in. When we first got there (mid-day) it actually wasn't that crowded at all. And the whole time we were there, other than the otter feeding, I never found it to be overly crowded. I'm glad, because from the sound of some of the other reviews it sounds kind of miserable on a busy weekend. It would really take away from the ""zen"" of it all. It really is kind of meditative, walking through the deep sea and other exhibits. They play the perfect, calming music and you can relax and watch the amazing jellyfish with their graceful motions, or the huge schools of silver sardines. They are very much like synchronized swimmers, really beautiful.  We took a break to get drinks at one point. It's nice that they offer a full coffee/tea/latte menu. There was nowhere to sit, but that was okay since it was just drinks. I can't imagine it on a truly crowded day. We had chai tea lattes and hot chocolate. The drinks were good, and priced about the same as anywhere else. It was around $9 for 3 small drinks, nothing unusual.Of course the otters were a huge hit with our two kids. They are very entertaining and active, so if you can get there for the feeding display, I'd recommend it. Here's a tip: get there early so you can try to snag a prime spot by the window. It was very crowded. There are many other feedings that take place throughout the day as well as 15 minute movies, but we didn't go to any of that so I can't make recommendations.We spent a total of around 3 hours there. If you have very young kids, you may go through it a bit faster. Others who like to read more of the information and really take their time, could take longer.In the end, having seen it for myself, I would say this. I do agree with those who say it's an excellent aquarium. It is. Go and see it. But I still think the $50 admission fee for adults is outrageous. We loved it, but for that price I doubt we'd go again."
628,2015-11-30,5,"This Aquarium is the biggest and most beautiful I have ever visited! It's totally worth the 2,5h drive from San Francisco (take the ""1"", it is a nice scenic route most of the time). Take the signed parking garage for 7$/day, it's a no brainer and not too far away.If you have a City Pass San Francisco you can use it here instead of visiting the Aquarium at the Pier in SF, you can also skip the line and enter right away.The employees are just friendly and helpful, if you have a question they are more happy to answer and inform you.The variety of plants and animals there is so huge, you can easily come back many times without being bored! They have many many aquariums, a big tide pool, hands-on stations, art exhibitions, feedings and live talks.If you pay attention you will learn almost everything there is to learn about the pacific coast in California.The gift shop is big and has lots of stuff to buy, not just kitsch, also nice and useful things (also for kids like books, bags,..) My favorites are:- the otters, they are so much fun, always playing with their toys, the feeding is a highlight! - the reeeeaaaally enormous ""open Sea"" Aquarium!! It contains a whole swarm of sardines, white sharks, hammerhead sharks, sea turtles and many more sea creatures! I could sit and watch it for hours and hours... - live talks, one of the experts tells you something about otters/ white sharks/ ..., shows you pictures and films and you get a look behind the scenes of the Monterey Bay AquariumWhat could be better? - More lockers/ a wardrobe. The lockers outside are more for bigger groups and you have to throw in 4 quarters.- if there is a huge line you have to wait outside, not so nice when the weather isn't all sunshine and rainbows"
629,2019-07-06,5,This was my familys first time at the aquarium. To see sea life like that was something else. It was beautiful and you felt like you were in the ocean its self. The kids loved it and had smiles on there faces the while time. I will definantly be taking the kids soon
630,2019-04-08,3,"Great place, at first it was quite fun there are a lot of fishes and sea creatures went with some friends. The food and merchandise they sell IS OVER PRICE! There was a nice earring that cost 50$ it wasn't even the size of a drop of water . But overall great staff and the prices were good. So if you need a quick vacation this is the place to go."
631,2018-12-17,5,"For tourists it's the main attraction,  for locals, be a member  , they have members nights not busy."
632,2018-06-05,5,I could spend hours and hours here! Everything was so well kept and clean. The Deep Sea exhibit and the otters were my favorite. You must go and visit this aquarium if you are in the area! It's a must see!!
633,2016-11-30,5,"This is a kid friendly aquarium, interactive. There are pools where kids can touch sting rays, sea kelp, starfish, shellfish. Specific areas for kids to learn n play. And educational too, they've staff to answer questions and lots of interesting facts to read every step of the way.I did get motion sickness from all them things swimming round and round. Good thing I didn't have an alcoholic slush or two or four, like I did in Vegas before the Mandalay Bay Shark exhibit. Yakkkkkk. We went the day after thanksgiving and it was reasonably crowded, not too overwhelming. I liked watching the sea otters, different types of cuttlefish and of course, the sea horses."
634,2017-01-01,2,"Everyone raves about this aquarium. But unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations especially at $50 per adult. I have been to numerous other aquariums and usually enjoy them but I have never paid this much. For the money, this place lacked the value in terms of exhibits. As others have said, I prefer live animals to videos and signs that I can see elsewhere. I also agree with others that it is crowded and geared towards children. I liked the kelp forest, tentacles and the sea otter exhibits. I also agree the sea otter exhibit is too small to fully enjoy with the large crowd. The cafe has good food but is limited and pricey. But you can get a hand stamp and go outside to cannery row where they have more options.Cannery row is cute. It has the charm of the past but is now full of gifts shops and restaurants to eat at. Street parking is $1.50/hr but we parked at a nearby lot for $10 all day. Nearby is a bike map that leads you to fisherman's wharf as well. View from the aquarium is pretty but you can access it without paying for admission. I enjoyed the aquarium but overpriced. I have seen it and won't be back unless they have a very special exhibit."
635,2018-12-16,4,"An awesome experience you have to try at least once. Located at one end of Cannery Row there are many places to eat and lot's to do nearby, also. It's a great place for kids with huge areas of exploration designated just for them.  It can get crowded on the weekends, though."
636,2015-09-10,5,"My friends and I almost didn't check it out since $39.95/person is very discouraging, but I'm so glad we did! Once we were inside, I got crazy excited since I LOVE aquariums. It was a little crowded but it wasn't too bad as there was a lot of space, and everyone just looks and leaves. There were gigantic tanks everywhere filled with kelp, fish, and sharks to look at and take pictures of. There were also a few super cute exhibits, my favorite was the Jellies Experience! It want to say it's got a 70's theme, and all the jelly fishies were so beautiful and glowing, and there were mini jellyfishes and big ones, there was also an interactive shadow/jellyfish thing. Clearly my explaining and pictures don't do it justice. I also got embarrassingly excited for the SEA OTTERS. UGH CUTE AF.To add to my experience, there was free wine and live entertainment! I'm not sure if there was a special event going on or if it's a everyday/weekend thing but it was a pleasant, unexpected surprise. Overall, this aquarium was the most exciting 2 hours of my weekend in Monterey."
637,2017-01-03,5,"So many feelings. This place is magical and a must see if you live in California or are visiting the area. My BF and I were in town for NYE and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn -- so we purchased our tickets at a discounted price of $40/adult with 2-day access and I am so glad we did. The first day we should up right around 10:30AM and stayed until 5:30 and explored the left side of the aquarium with the Sea Otters, touch pools, penguins and kelp forest but also watched almost all of the shows that were put on by the aquarium staff. This was definitely one of my favorite parts, I learned so much about the animals and research going into preserving our marine life. Make sure to make time to watch a good handful of these.The second day we showed up around noon to check out the right side of the aquarium and I am glad we came back for this part. The right side of the aquarium has a SPECTACULAR exhibit of jellyfish like nothing you've seen before. It blows my mind to think about how this planet creating you and I... and also species such as these jellyfish. The Tentacles exhibit, Viva Baja and Saving the Oceans are also all on this side of the aquarium. I'm excited to come back and be able to help support such an amazing place sometime in the near future."
638,2018-12-14,2,"This is a nice place, if you can afford it. It's so expensive that only a few elite can really visit. But if you like paying $7 for a side of fries, this is the attaction for you. They have some fish, but getting your money seems to be their only real priority."
639,2018-09-25,3,Its wonderful and full of amazing life and information. Being a local and knowing that the aquarium makes millions upon millions makes me disappointing that they have raise the prices for people to get in so much. At the prices that they have it for a family to go it cost almost a much as a year membership but for a lot of people especially visitors from other areas that will really only go once its really not fair. I am a member and I only go a handful of times maybe. If you don't believe me go on the website they post all their $$$ on it. Considering how much money they make and that they are fully funded by the Packard family its not right to charge such high rates when they really are not adding anything new over there.
640,2016-11-22,5,"DISCLAIMER: I was SO AWED / AMUSED by the jelly fish - LOTS OF PICTURES there! #sorrynotsorry We did a spontaneous visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium on a Sunday afternoon. Parking: We didn't have a problem finding free street parking, but it may be because it was Sunday. There is also a paid parking garage. Service: The staff at the aquarium were friendly. As we walked in, there was someone who had maps ready and let us know any exhibits that were coming up. We got lost a couple times, trying to find various exhibits, and the staff were knowledgeable and ready to help (with a smile). Seriously, great accommodation by the MBA staff!  Visit: I would give at least 3 - 4 hours to visit the aquarium (and a couple more hours to explore the town). There was an exhibit for everyone including: a) kids playing area b) hands-on learning where a staff would talk about different sea life, and you could feel it (I touched an eel!!) c) viewing of fish, sharks, etc. In the eating area, there was a band playing music - so soothing and perfect to end a Sunday! My favorite exhibit by far was the jelly fish; they are amazing creatures and so beautiful! Verdict: This is great place for families, going on a date, or just exploring on your own / with friends. I would come here again. The service provided by the staff was superb! The variety of sea life and exhibits were not only beautiful but just so amazing. I would come back here on a Saturday, as some exhibits were closed on Sunday. Be prepared to have many Instagram-worthy pictures! :)"
641,2016-11-18,5,"California Trip Part 2 #6I have been to the Sydney Aquarium, the Aquarium of Western Australia, and National Aquarium in Baltimore. However, nothing compares to my experience at Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA). I knew people said that MBA is amazing, but I still thought I would be disappointed when I arrived. Well, that didn't happen. Here are my favorite moments at MBA:1) Journey to Baja: A Tale of Three TravelersThis is a movie in the auditorium, but this is no regular movie. There is a real live staff person who narrates it along with the show. It was nothing I've ever experienced before and I really enjoyed it! She did an amazing job, btw.2) Talking to the volunteers It was so interesting to converse with the volunteers. Many of them had movedfrom other parts of the country and fell in love with California (like me!). 3) Life on the BayThis is where you go outside, check out the spectacular Monterey Bay and all of the wonderful animals in the wild. I saw birds and seals while I was out there.4) Sandy Shore & Aviary If you're a photographer like me, this is the place to be. You're able to get up close to these amazing birds! This was one of my favorites.5) Sea OttersIt's definitely fun to watch the sea otters swim around and do their thing. Personally, I can't deal with the crowds so I didn't hang out during feeding time. I preferred to visit their exhibit when it was semi-quiet and I could take photos. *Bonus* I sometimes check out their webcam--makes me feel like I'm back at MBA. montereybayaquarium.org/…"
642,2018-12-26,5,Great place for kids and we enjoyed the open ocean feeding. The staff is super helpful and Roland assisted us and was very very kind and sweet. Great staff and attractions as well as a place to learn. Amazing aquarium and very much recommend for adults and children!
643,2017-01-21,5,"I had the great idea to come to the aquarium, however it was not a very well thought out one. We went on a holiday weekend. Such a bad decision. Of course there were a lot of people which is really great for the aquarium. But since it was the weekend there were lots of kids and tourists. The next time I go I will try for during the middle of the week. We arrived about an hour after they opened and we got luckily finding street parking. They do have some parking garages nearby and they have an adorable trolley which drops off people to the front of the building. The staff were really friendly and pointed out some things that I could have easily missed. There was plenty to see and you could easily spend all day here. We only spent half the day here and missed out on some of the things upstairs but since we for discounted tickets we got our money's worth. Although it's definitely a touristy area, it's nice to visit every couple of years. Maybe just avoid the weekends."
644,2019-05-17,5,"Best of all the aquariums I and my family have visited: Long Beach, San Diego, Etc. The various exhibits are well maintained and special events rotate allowing for a new experience or adventure at each visit."
645,2018-06-24,4,"An all time favorite place to visit with friends, family, or even by yourself if you're that interested in marine life. I'd visit all the time with my parents, and made wonderful memories that I cherish as I'm older now. Whether I visited for old times sake, a date with my partner, or for research purposes for a paper, the experience has never been less than enjoyable. Some staff members are a bit strict, but with a bunch of children running around I understand why."
646,2015-08-30,5,"We're not big aquarium goers but we knew this was one we could not miss. This place really is awesome with a very enthusiastic and helpful staff. Yes the $40 admission is pretty steep but the experience was worth it. The Kelp forest, the jelly fish display and the otters were highlights. We even liked the small section on the history of the canneries. Not having kids in tow we were in the minority on this Sunday morning and so some of the exhibits like the touching tanks and splash zone were of less interest. I'm guessing weekdays during the school year maybe a bit calmer... then again I'm sure the school groups swarm this place!Overall they have done a superb job of making the exhibits super interactive.  Their reputation is well deserved!"
647,2018-01-17,5,"I've been coming to The Monterey Bay Aquarium since I was little. I've been here on countless school field trips and have visited this aquarium many times with friends and family. I have many fond memories here. I've had a wonderful time at each and every visit. No matter how many times I come here, it never gets old! It is refreshing to see that after all these years this place remains in tip-top shape, very well maintained with plenty to see and do! Thanks in part to members and generous donors, this aquarium is rated one of the best aquariums in the world!I have noticed that in the last couple years the exhibits haven't changed too much. So it's always a pleasant surprise to see a new exhibit. Honestly, I love this place so much I could probably see the same exhibits such as the sea otter and penguin exhibits all the time, any time!  Although I have been here many times, you'd think I've seen it all.  However with all the crowds, the occasional changing of exhibits, and with so much to see, it can be difficult to see everything!  You must come back because you might have missed something the first time around.  I try to take the time to read the various exhibit descriptions that are posted everywhere which makes this not only a fun experience, but an educational one too. For example I learned that there is a difference between sardines and anchovies. Who knew?!!? Speaking of anchovies, you must check out the Northern anchovies featured in the Open Sea Exhibit! It's mesmerizing to see thousands of anchovies synchronized swimming in an endless loop in a ceiling aquarium.Be sure to plan your visit for the optimum experience. Check their website for the feeding schedules and show schedules so you can plan your visit accordingly.  My favorite exhibit is the sea otters. They are so cute and rambunctious!  However be warned. The sea otter show/feeding is probably the most popular so as soon as you enter the aquarium you'd better high tail it on over there!  Otherwise you won't be able to see a thing!  Especially if you are vertically challenged like me. Lol I also like to see the live feeding at the Kelp Forest. Watch a diver hand-feed the sharks, fishes and other animals while a show presenter provides a live, interactive presentation where you can learn about this unique and beautiful undersea world. The daily shows and feedings start at 10:30 am. If you by chance miss a morning show or feeding, there is usually another show/feeding in the afternoon. Otherwise, there are plenty of interactive options like touch pools and informative videos played on a loop. The kids love the touch pools and there is a Kids Zone play area as well.  The café is okay.  Although a bit pricy so if you can, pack your own food and beverages.  For locals, The Monterey Bay Aquarium offers free admission for local residents of Monterey County, Santa Cruz County, and San Benito County. My Family and I try to take advantage of these free admission days that occur once a year during the first week of December. Admission is pretty pricey at $49.95 for an adult and $29.95 for children ages 3-12. $39.95 for students and seniors. Parking. There's a parking garage in the Cannery Row as well as a parking lot about a block away. Bring your walking shoes because parking can be difficult to find. The aquarium is a fun, informative experience that everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime!"
648,2018-10-29,5,"A very exhaustive exhibit, featuring various diverse ecosystems. The open sea aquarium is especially incredible with beautiful panaromic views of the open oceans. Simply spectacular! The outside decks with views of the marine sanctuary is one of the best. Also, the numerous play areas for little ones is a great addition."
649,2017-06-07,5,"Even the prices have gone up from a few years ago, it is definitely worth it! Just make sure you come first thing in the morning and take your time enjoying all the beautiful creatures! I live about 2 and half hours away and it was so worth it.Parked just a few blocks up the way and for $20.00 all day parking, that is a steal!They have group event tickets as well, so I thought that was really neat. The views were breath taking if you want to step outside of the aquarium for some fresh coastal air. The day we went (Saturday 06/03) was perfect.Located at the end of Cannery Row you are just a walk away from small shops, dessert shops, food places and the beach! I am already planning a trip to go back with more family and friends.My favorite part was the jellyfish, it glowed and had some kind of magic to it... oh and then the large huge tank with the sharks, huge fish, sardines... OMG, just remembering these things makes me want to take off work and go drive there..."
650,2018-11-24,5,Best aquarium I've ever been to. They put the sea creatures in cool habitats that are fun to watch.
651,2017-07-07,5,"If you love the ocean & all the ocean has in it this is the place you have to visit at least one in your lifetime. It is magnificent and all the under sea ocean wonders ever. I am so glad I came here ! $49.99/50$ a pop per adult. Bam. Yes it's expensive but I have to admit the Monterey Bay aquarium is clean and glorious with the different exhibits offered. The aquarium is a bucket list type thing you have to see the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It takes you up to 2 hours up to endless hours here. You can easily spent a whole day here if you wanted  too. Gift shops at least 2. I spotted one on top floor and one on bottom floor. The sea otters and the penguins are here too. Outside also has a bird exhibit.My favorite was the Jellies. Man, those things are breathing beautiful. It's amazing to see the beauty in the jelly and how it defends itself and the different species of jellies they have here. Video information on fish & sea creatures are everywhere touch type computers. It's state of the art equipment. Lots of staff everywhere. Ppl in the Bay are friendly as well. Great for all kinds. Lots of kids, families & grandpa's and grandma's. Must see: Abby, Giget, Kit the otters, they are totally so so friendly and playful.  Sting rays be careful. Yikes. Parking super easy. $15 Also, I have never seen sooo many sharks in my life. Yes there's a lot of them here & big ones. Crowds: we came on a Friday afternoon in the Summer around 12:00pm wasn't bad but @ 2:00pm crowded. Thank gosh we left then. Bus loads come from schools. Come you won't be disappointed."
652,2019-05-14,5,Best aquarium ever!!!!!! Totally worth it and I hope to return again!! Super educational and science based! The touch tanks were amazing and the staff were so patient and nice! They really focus on education here. Lots of activities for both kids and adults. A wonderful experience and worth the money. 10/10 would return again!
653,2019-06-21,5,It never gets old! The Aquarium just gets better and better.  They manage to keep all the good stuff while updating and keeping things exciting and new.  We brought our daughter here when she was young and now we plan to start bringing our grandchildren.
654,2015-07-30,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is the best aquarium I've been to in my life. With life being so crazy lately, my boyfriend decided to cheer me up by taking me on a little trip to Monterey Bay and it was definitely worth the three hour drive. We came at the end of July on a weekday and it was just a little too crowded, making it difficult to fully spend time to look around. However, this isn't the aquarium's fault. My guess is it's a lot more busy in the summer since the kids are off. So if you like visiting on a more peaceful day, don't go in the summer time. The aquarium is located right in Cannery Row, in a very touristy area. The aquarium is huge compared to the ones we've been to the San Francisco. There's 2 floors and plenty of awesome things to see and do. The maps provided makes getting around the aquarium quite easy. There are huge, huge tanks of fishes to see, from small little cute ones to sharks and giant tunas. There was the sea otter spot, a jellyfish and Tentacles (octopus) spot (one of my favorite spots! I stood there staring at these for nearly 20 minutes). There are touch pools where we get to touch cute little hermit crabs, rays, and sea plants. There's also access to the outside to do some whale watching (if you're lucky, you'll see one!). There are tons of little gift shops around to grab yourself little gifts for friends and family along with the cafe in case you're hungry. (I do recommend saving your appetite to eat at one of the better restaurants in the area such as the Old Fisherman's Grotto which I will also review). Overall, this aquarium and this city is just a great and nearby place if you want to just getaway for a day by the oceanside."
655,2016-11-30,4,"The captivating and innovating Monterey Bay Aquarium is packed full of wonderful attractions for all ages. Your immediately taken back as you walk into this multi story facility with its natural wonders and artfully decorated vast facility. Offering many interactive and informational exhibits for your young ones and you to enjoy there's always somthing new and fun around every corner. From the touch pools crawling with smallest of marine life to the penguin feeding show my family and I really had a wonderful time visiting the aquarium. There are multiple shows throughout the day listed with your brochure and also available online so make sure to them check out to help plan your days itinerary. Just of few of the shows include multiple penguin feeding times, an informative shark show and the always entertaining otter feeding. Tickets prices: (18-64 and not in college) $49.95Child Admission (3-12, under 3 free) $29.95Senior Admission (65+) $39.95Student Admission (13-17 or college ID) $39.95"
656,2019-10-12,4,"It's a very nice aquarium.  My wife and I always make it a point to visit aquariums and zoos when we visit a new city.  We had been wanting to check out the Monterey Bay Aquarium for quite a few years and it didn't disappoint.  I'd strongly advise you visit on a week day if possible though. We had no choice but to visit on a Saturday and it was beyond packed.  There are some gorgeous specimens and quite a few that we had only seen on Nat Geo or Animal Planet.  I'll always hold Aquariums to the standard of the Atlanta Aquarium and Mote Marine Aquarium in Sarasota, FL. and although this one comes close it's not quite to their level in my opinion.  I think the biggest flaw with Monterey Bay Aquarium is the layout.  There's no real flow to move from exhibit to exhibit and make sure you've seen everything. Three separate times we had to stop after coming to the end of one section, check our map, and make sure we headed to a place we hadn't seen yet. I prefer aquariums that have a nice flow to walk as it helps move the crowds through the confined spaces as well.  It wouldn't be as noticeable during a week day but when it's super busy the lack of attention to detail in the layout of the facility seriously hampers the experience. Still - well worth a visit if you're aquarium hounds like we are.  One of the very best."
657,2018-06-16,5,Last visited aquarium 30 years ago I was done by how much it had evolved this is truly one of the magnificent wonders of the world and my hats off to all the engineers who have contributed to building and the marine habitat folks Love combine to make this truly one of the premier attractions in the worldThe animation where you color the fish and the kids get a chance to color in their own fish and then launch it into this computer screen aquarium quite unique and spectacular for inter-active learning
658,2016-12-11,5,"My family finally decided to purchase the family membership so the kids can enjoy the aquarium whenever they want!This place is always changing and always up to date with the latest information and facts about our oceans and planet!They take great care of their employees and have hundreds of volunteers that work at the aquarium daily!Plan for a whole day when visiting! And plan to watch the different feedings of penguins and otters and in the kelp forest. Check out the restaurant on site as well!Seriously a great place! Some people complain about the price, but if you look at what is offered and the care they give each animal within the aquarium....it gets expensive I'm sure!"
659,2018-03-25,4,"My husband and I visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium a few weeks ago with our 4 month old baby! It was easy to get to! We parked on cannery row! It was raining but thankfully it's all indoors! For some reason we expected the type of aquariums we see in movies lol where the walls, ceilings, and hallways are like we are walking inside a fish tank! Maybe like an amusement park too! Well it was different than we expected but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It was really like a museum with fish tanks lined up along the walls with information about the fish. It was extremely crowded on a Saturday early afternoons. It died down around an hour before closing. I think it's a great place to bring your kids maybe not baby lol! There's an awesome kids section upstairs!! It's great for learning and I think every kid would be in awe and very educated by visiting here!! We sort of rushed through with our stroller and baby. It was hard not to bump into people. It's a nice aquarium. Pretty pricey $100 for 2 of us. We were in and out in about 2 hours. We ate at the cafeteria style aquarium cafe. It was okay. I liked the room where you sit to eat since it has huge windows all around  with an open view of the ocean. It was crowded and the food was mediocre. I say it's overpriced. $24 for two half sandwiches and 2 small bowls of soup. We enjoyed our time here and will be back when we our children our at least 3 and older!"
660,2015-08-13,5,"Date: 8/11/2015  Time: 10:45 AM  61°.  Partially cloudyThe Mastick Senior Citizen Group's tour of the month was a bus trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row this morning. I haven't been to this aquarium in over 20 years. The total cost of the trip was $50 per person...a decent value. Lunch was on our own. We had four hours to tour the aquarium, eat lunch and walk around Cannery Row before boarding the bus to head home at 3:00 PM.Our group disembarked from the bus and were greeted by Cameron who handed us a map of the layout of the aquarium. The map was somewhat helpful, but then I did get a little twisted on the second floor. There was no need to panic; my husband told me we just follow everybody else...cool.My husband and I enjoyed most of the exhibits - the Open Sea, the jellyfish experience and the puffins. It seem as though the puffins knew they were being admired by us onlookers, striking poses for our cameras. The sea otters were adorable, swimming and eating on their backs. The kelp forest and tentacles exhibits were okay to him; however, we did not see any gargantual octopuses that we can only see in our wild imagination in movies like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Voyage Under the Sea. Nor did we see the ones squirting that inky stuff. The building also houses a huge gift and bookstore, an auditorium and Cindy Waterfront Restaurant/Cafe, all on the first floor. Outside of the structure is the Great Tide Pool Amphitheater and the Wildlife Viewing Station. There are two smaller gift stores on the second floor. Alas, we did not see everything that the aquarium had to offer. Thus, there will be a returned visit to cover the nooks and crannies of the Monterey Bay Aquarium."
661,2017-04-10,5,"I haven't been there since I was a kid, and boy this place is larger than I can recall and simply breath taking.   The fish, the tanks, the information all of it is simply top notch.  I was blown away, I've been to a few other aquariums and Monterey is hands down the best I've seen. Easy to stroll without a guide, easy to navigate and so much self guided information its great! The price is a bit high at initial thought, but once you are inside its worth every penny!!!  Take your kids and go go go!!!"
662,2018-09-03,3,"The Monterey Aquarium was worth checking out at least once but, I would not go again. First, we went on a Sunday and it was packed. Even the line to buy tickets was at least an hour long. Luckily I bought our tickets online, which I strongly recommend doing. Inside was packed to where people were practically stepping on each other. Another reviewer suggested they cap how many tickets are sold in one day, I have to say that I agree .. though it's not gonna happen. There were crowds of people, surrounding every exhibit and, you pretty much need to have patience and slowly push your way to the front, just to get a decent view. Wherever you walk in this place, you will have to dodge little kids running around,and parents pushing behemoth baby carriages. My fiancé even heard three different people at different times say that the aquarium was a sh!t show. All in all, it was a nice aquarium but, for the cost of $50 per ticket, I was not blown away. Glad I visited once but definitely no need to see it again."
663,2019-05-25,5,I wanna give a shout out to Madi! She has the best customer service ever! My sister and I came here for the first time and she has the best welcoming attitude. She was also super helpful with information since it was our first time.
664,2019-06-09,3,"I'm on the fence with this place! You hear it's the best, you got to see it, but I've been to other aquariums & this isn't the best.  The price is way too high, so consider it a donation because price does not equal value.  It's double the price of others that are better IMO. It's enjoyable & you see a lot but it's not a standout at all!  My suggestion go early, leave for lunch (get stamped to return) & shopping then finish off at aquarium.  And consider the steep entry fee as a donation!  Also, maybe you can find a coupon that'll reduce the fee."
665,2018-02-02,5,"This is not my first visit to the aquarium, but it was my first visit with a KID. I went for a whole day by myself w/ my 1 year old on a Wednesday- hardly any crowds, plenty of helpful staff. We brought our stroller, snacks and bottles of water in w/ no problem.(PRO TIP: See if you qualify for a discounted ticket before buying from the aquarium direct! I'm a member of a participating credit union that gave me a $10 discount for entrance fee-- check the aquarium website for whole list of participating credit unions, etc. that may give you an entry discount. This was nice because it canceled out the $10 all day parking in the garage two blocks away)Anyway, all day in this aquarium (1030am-445pm, we had to kill time while my husband was working) with a 1 yr old was super easy. Plenty of restrooms everywhere (all with changing tables), each one had a button to auto-open the door so I could push the stroller right in without struggling with the door shutting on me, and then go into the wheelchair access stall. There are also little seats on the wall, with straps in these stalls if you need to pin down an older child while you use the restroom.The nursing lounge on the second floor near the restrooms was a godsend, we used it three times that day and no one else was in it any of those times. There are 3 comfy chairs with separations for privacy, lots of outlets for charging phones(after using maps to get to the aquarium and then taking photos all day this was perfect), calming music with tv of aquatic life, books for entertaining siblings while you feed, bottle warmer for bottle fed babies. So amazing. It is located across the bridge from the coral reef area on the second floor, kind of back in the corner.Speaking of the coral reef, we kind of lived there throughout the day as my kid got restless in the stroller and it was a great, contained place for her to get her energy out, play in some water (there are cute little smocks provided for water play) and stretch her legs with some other kids. There is stroller parking right outside this area, and no one ever messed with our stuff when we left it there. Anyway, it was awesome, and even with a 1 year old baby there was plenty to do and see and it is one of the most kid-friendly places I have ever been to. We will be back!!"
666,2015-06-03,5,"Oh my gosh, how can I begin! The Monterey Bay Aquarium is the ""mother"" of all aquariums! It is absolutely incredible. I wish we would have had more time to spend exploring all of the exhibits. The day we were there was fairly busy with lots of school kids, but it never seems crowded. We could have spent the whole day in the ""jellyfish"" room. Watching all the different varieties of jellyfish was fascinating.Fr lunch we ate at the cafe in the aquarium and enjoyed fresh California fruits and a wonderful, locally sourced ingredient pizza. It was fabulous. I couldn't believe it was being served in the museum's cafe.Later on in the afternoon, we did the ""behind the scenes"" tour. We felt very special since it was just my wife and I on the tour. I highly recommend it. We got to tour all the back area of the aquarium and learn how it operates. We learned about the museum's conservation efforts and all their special research programs. WOW!! If you're in the area, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a MUST!"
667,2016-11-02,2,"DeFINitely over priced. $50 a person is crazy especially since 90% of what you see is an aquarium campaigning for ""more fishing rules and regulations"", ""do your part to save the animals"" etc.I'm aware of that, and you probably are too. But I don't want it shoved down my throat. I'd rather see my money invested in the actual animals, and not all the signs and videos. Most of what you see and hear are screaming children everywhere, which is understandable and forgivable since it's geared towards children. The hammer head sharks, jellyfish and sea Otters were cool. But, not for $50. I'd rather spend that on a four hour whale watching cruise. Also, bring light jacket, it's cooler inside the aquarium.Everyone really talked it up.. So maybe that's why I was disappointed. Worth it for $20 tops. But not more than twice that."
668,2015-10-27,5,"Such a great aquarium! I was a bit hesitant when my dad suggested we go here because it sounded extremely touristy-which it kind of is-but for good reason. This aquarium had penguins, otters, sharks, jellyfish, octopus, fish, eels, crabs, lobsters, puffins and much more! I learned so much about life underwater and am so glad I was able to come here. There was an especially cool exhibit called ""Out to Sea"" or ""Under the Sea"" or something similar to that. It actually felt like you were underwater. Especially with the calming music that was playing (there is music playing throughout the aquarium too). I also loved the quotes throughout the Aquarium from Dr. Seuss, Henry Thoreau, etc. All very relatable and interesting. At 4:00 pm, it was feeding time for the fish! It was actually pretty cool. It was a ""presentation"", with a lady explaining the feeding process while there was a scuba diver actually feeding the fish in the tank. I would definitely recommend this aquarium if you are in Monterey but it is $40 for adults so not sure I would go back but it was definitely worth it for the one time!"
669,2018-11-05,5,They have the best customer service. The entire staff. From the person that answered the call about a question we had the day before ~ to the lady that wheeled my mom all the way to our Lyft driver and then returned the wheelchair that they let us use all day for free. Everyone was kind & helpful. Oh & the kids LOVED it all!
670,2016-10-08,4,"You MUST make it a point to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium at least once in your life! That being said, I think a single visit is all you need to feel satisfied. I say this because adult admission is a hefty *$50 and $40 with a student ID*. The aquarium, while simply amazing, isn't all that big and really only requires 2 hours to fully explore all exhibits. Thankfully, I didn't pay on my 2nd visit, so I'm not feeling all that bitter about the admission fee. *Hint: I guess it pays to know someone who works there.*The aquarium is VERY popular and attracts quite the crowd so parking nearby can be challenging. We did opt for the parking structure which was $10 with no limit. It is equally crowded inside the aquarium especially at the most popular attractions. The sea otter exhibit during feeding time is a frenzy on both sides of the glass, just so you know. They are freakin cute though and I was definitely guilty of lingering for too long just so I could watch them have so much blind fun. Despite the crowds and recollections of the tortured animals in 'Finding Dory', I still enjoyed my visits. Even though there's still little evidence out there regarding the immediate educational effect of aquariums and zoos on a visitor, I still think it's beneficial to a point and a great way to get someone excited about the ocean! So I still encourage you to visit! Maybe it'll evoke some fascination in you as well."
671,2018-05-05,4,Been here a few times over the years and every time you come you see something new.  Great play areas and interactive activities for the kids.  This is a very cool place and it is worth the price of admission the otters and penguin exhibit are my favorite.
672,2019-06-02,4,"Love the aquarium.  They really care about their mission of saving the ocean.  I especially like how they are advocating for the use of reusable items instead of disposable ones.  However, the cafeteria there was disappointing.  Many of their options were unhealthy (ie. fish & chips, pepperoni pizza etc).  They did have a salad bar but that was basically the only vegan option.  And salad does not make a filling meal.  They say on the walls of the cafeteria that  people should eat sustainably but I think that it would be great if they made that possible in their own cafeteria.  The cafeteria could have really delicious, healthy and filling meals that align with sustainability on land.  It could have some junk food options but people should at least have the option of eating healthy.  Many vegans care about the environment like the aquarium does and want to support the aquarium by eating at their cafeteria.  Again, I really appreciate the aquarium and what they do to educate the public, and when the aquarium improves their cafeteria, it will be a much more enjoyable place to visit."
673,2015-08-18,5,"I was expecting a lot from this aquarium when we first walked in. But I had to remember this was not Sea World. I would not be seeing Orcas or Dolphins or Great Whites (Sea World doesn't have great whites but any who...). With realistic expectations, hubby and I set off to be edumacated on all things ocean-life.  As soon as you step foot into the aquarium, you are met with people that work their holding small tanks containing pretty sea life, little jelly fish, for instance. The kids were loving it and I stood their for a good 20 seconds checking them out too. If you look up near the info desk area (it's hard to miss really), you'll see the life-sized Orca replica hanging from the ceiling.  The aquarium is split up in different floors and different areas. The 1st floor houses the special exhibitions (currently ""Tentacles"" and ""The Jellies Experience"". The Sea Otters (delightful creatures and very popular exhibit, hard to get a good view), aviary, octopus, Kelp forest, restaurant/cafe and auditorium are all in the 1st floor.Up on the 2nd floor are the penguins and touch pools (very crowded around there). They do several feelings throughout the day at several exhibits, check the schedules for those as they're pretty exciting to watch.The cost of admission is a little high in my opinion, 39.95 for adults, 34.95 for students with ID.  The aquarium is modern and state of the art; I'm sure much of the ticket price goes into maintaining it. It's definitely worth a visit, especially if you've got little ones."
674,2018-02-26,5,"Wow what a great place to take the family. My eight year old loves this place. Not only is it really fun but you really do learn a lot. I had a mess up on our tickets that was completely my fault and a staff member and the manager (I think his name is Kirt) helped us out. Great customer service! The place is also very clean every tank is spotless. You could spend your whole day here, there is just so much too see! I can't wait to come back soon."
675,2018-04-30,4,"The weekends get super packed. That's understandable, most people are off from work on the weekends.....try to go during the week to avoid the huge crowds and the kids that like to run everywhere.The otter exhibit is my favorite! They're so freaking cute!I know they offer tons of family days and people of all ages can enjoy. The exhibits are fun, interactive, and family friendly too. If you can, stay a few minutes and listen to the staff talk about different animals and their natural habits."
676,2015-07-04,5,"Yup, as good as it gets!You gotta love the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Everyone is in a good mood, excellent atmosphere, great staff, great exhibits, great town, etc.  After reading many of the reviews here, I really don't have any great tips other than to come really, really early if you're coming on a holiday weekend!  We drove from the east bay to Monterey and it was pretty hellacious!  There was so much traffic along the way...well, you folks who've lived up all your life are probably laughing at my stupidity :)  Anyways, one tip I do have is if you're going to come here on a holiday weekend and if you have a little change in the pocket, pony up the bucks and eat at Cindy's because the food is great and you can avoid the big crowds in the main dining area."
677,2018-11-26,5,"This aquarium is amazing, inspiring, awesome, fantastic, and educational. They truly care about the ocean and are taking drastic steps to help reduce plastic use, their carbon footprint, and food waste while acting as a educational powerhouse to inform the public not only about the amazing sea creatures it houses, but also to empower them to take the steps necessary to save our oceans. The exhibits are incredible. From the stunning jellyfish exhibit, to the friendly otters, to the massive Open Sea exhibit, this aquarium is a must-see for anyone visiting Monterey."
678,2018-11-10,5,"Great place to relax around 3! Gets no better then this the exhibits are great. We love the octopuses and giant tank with all the sharks, turtles and sometimes an awesome sun fish."
679,2019-02-17,2,No big animals. Not super impressive. A lot of fish. Lots of kids activities so probably great if you have a toddler!
680,2018-03-03,5,I've been here many times ver the last 20+ years and I truly love it. The exhibits change from time to time keeping things fresh and interesting. It's clean and well organized. Only compliant is that it's popular and gets crowded.
681,2018-04-16,4,"This is an awesome aquarium. The open sea and sea otter exhibits were my favorite. The aquarium itself is situated in a scenic area and if you have time after you should end the day with a stroll down Cannery Row. Overall, it's very informative and my only critique is that it's a little pricey at $100 for 2 adults."
682,2016-11-06,5,"WOW! JUST WOWOWSBHDKEKDKFLELSJDJEKSJDHDJEJ!!! THIS PLACE IS SO AMAZING!!! (This was my reaction to the kelp forest.)There's so much to enjoy and so many sea creatures to see! My favorite attractions: Kelp Forest - This is a building-sized tank of sea life. It has many many different kinds of fish. It also has scheduled feeding times where the fish get fed and a speaker educates visitors about the fish and the kelp forest.Touch Pools - Various different creatures that we could touch included sting rays (don't worry, their stingers have been cut), sea anemones, hermit crabs and sea urchins!Otters - There is a tank that is dedicated to four otters and they are fed at specific times (come early to feedings since it will get VERRRRY crowded). But even if you do come late, their are screens where you can watch the feeding.There are many many more including jellyfish, octopus and penguins, and it'll likely take at least a few hours to finish looking at everything so plan ahead of time and bring snacks (the aquarium allows you to bring snacks and drinks). There's so much to do here, there is something for everyone!"
683,2017-03-03,4,"First time being at this aquarium in a while, but I loved it.We started off looking at the otters, then moved on to the outdoor viewing deck where an otter had been spotted swimming around. We proceeded to walk through all the exhibits and enjoyed each one.There are many programs and feedings throughout the day, so if this interests you make sure you're looking at the time!"
684,2015-05-15,5,"This aquarium is simply splendid and fantastic!! Well staffed with volunteers and docents, trainers and marine science peeps.Wonderful layout with so much to see, much more at which to marvel and be in awe of the utter diversity in the water.The :15 film series in the auditorium are well done. Quite interesting and many subjects to view.The various corners of the auditorium all contain various highlighted regions of the deep.The ROV model was also intriguing. Very easy to spend a good 4-6 hours here! They allowed me to bring in my own food.AAA offers discounts on tix."
685,2015-04-03,5,"What can I say about the Monterey Bay Aquarium that has not been said already? This is one of the best attractions in Northern California, and having visited aquariums in Asia, Australia, Europe and other parts of the U.S., I dare say this is one of the best aquariums in the world. If you have kids, you MUST take them to this aquarium! As seasoned visitors and parents of two young ones who are interested and have a blast at the aquarium, but also get tired in about 2-3 hours, and occasionally a bit scared, we've picked up a few tips and tricks to make the most of our aquarium experience. Tickets/Membership - adult tickets are $40, kids are $20, so for our family of four we purchased the year-long membership for $195 in January this year. It's already paid for itself! Member perks we like are an extra hour at the museum (it's great to have the place practically to yourself from 5-6 pm!), a separate member entrance (no lines) and 10% off at the restaurant inside (Cindy's Waterfront). But the best part about the membership is that we have no pressure to see EVERYTHING in order to get our money's worth - if the kids are tired we leave or take a break - there is always next time. Parking - we've usually found parking on Foam Street one block ""above"" the aquarium. Street spots have meters but allow you to pay by credit card ($1.50 per hour for up to 12 hours) and there are also a couple of surface lots with numbered parking spots where you can park for $15 for the full day. Food - the aforementioned Cindy's Waterfront serves excellent food and prices are not as ridiculous as one might expect. I usually get a half sandwich and a large bowl of clam chowder for $12 or so. The kids love the little brownies and cookies (~$3) and pizza (~$10). The attractions - everything you can imagine and more. Like the touch pools with their kelp, bat-rays and leopard sharks, the always entertaining otters, puffins and penguins, the majestic hammerheads, tuna and other giants of the deep, the mesmerizing nautilus, octopus and jellyfish. There is something for everyone here! And if the kids get bored or scared (my daughter once ran terrified from a diver who was cleaning the kelp forest tank!), take them outdoors to look at the ocean, or to one of the play areas that are scattered throughout the aquarium, or for a show in the auditorium. So come on over to Monterey and head over to one of the best aquariums in Northern California, the U.S., perhaps even the world!"
686,2018-11-21,5,It is huge full of rhings everyone in the family will enjoy  it has slot of history and even wild life right outside
687,2018-11-05,3,This was a really cool place to go! But I don't think it's worth the price you pay. I thought it would be bigger. Definitely don't regret going but I'm not sure if I would go again. The exhibits were cool and they had a lot of hands on things which is cool for the kids or adults! If you have never been I would fork the money to do it but don't have your bar set to high.
688,2016-09-17,1,"I would rather take my $45 bucks and take my chances trying to win a goldfish at a carnival or build my own aquarium at home than to come see some giant fishes here. I mean, sure, this place would be a great field trip for elementary school kids or a very expensive first date but lol. The aquarium is filled with sharks, jellyfishes, and locked up penguins. The music is enticing, but really, who are you trying to captivate and amaze? All these ocean creatures are locked inside of a giant pool of ""fresh"" water. Quote, ""fresh."" Times have changed, and I remember I was able to touch some starfish, crabs, and an octopus. Nowadays, you're only able to touch different kinds of kelps out in the ocean. Is this a new liability thing now?I should have timed my stay here because I can honestly, I think we were only here for 45 minutes. So nope, sorry Monterey Bay Aquarium, maybe it's just not meant to be for you and me."
689,2018-09-07,5,"So awesome!!! I was not expecting why we saw inside but was blown away by the quality and number of exhibits. Coming from Seattle and comparing to the waterfront aquarium, this is hands-down a much better one to visit. Hopefully Seattle is taking notes and will find a way to improve its exhibit to be more like this one!"
690,2015-04-19,5,"I started coming here as a kid, and because of those visits I wanted to be a marine biologist. It's been great to return a few times a year and even better to see the kids start to enjoy the aquarium.It's true, this aquarium can get uncomfortably crowded, but I can still spend countless hours here, taking photos of the same animals over and over. It's a bit quieter in the hour or so before it closes, especially on weekdays. Also if you're a member they have member nights a few times a year starting at 7pm.The cornerstones of the aquarium are incredible - the deep sea, kelp forest, and sea otters are each mesmerizing in their own way, especially during feeding time (it's nearly impossible to see anything for the otters, but the other two spaces are set up well for larger groups). There are tons of other kid-friendly encounters as well, like the tide pools set up for touching animals and the Splash Zone. Of course, our four year-old's favorite activity doesn't really have anything to do with animals, it's being able to put sea-themed stamps on the free aquarium bookmarks.This is a great place to lose yourself for a few hours, especially if you can get in when there are fewer people around."
691,2016-11-17,5,"This place is definitely a gem and such a great part of my childhood that I'm making sure it's apart of my children's. There's so much to see and do that it sometimes feels like our very first visit almost every time. Favorite things to do: -catch feeding times, like the sea otters, kelp forest and penguins -sit and absorb the views of the Deep Sea exhibit -pet the bat rays and enjoy the views on a nice day from the viewing deckWe have a family membership at $195/year. Two adults and up to 4 or 5 children, I can't remember. Definitely pays for itself if you go 2 or 3 times. Plus the money goes to a great cause and there's a discount for any one of the events, like the sleepover, which is a must do! Parking near Cannery Row with an average of $10/day. Great ploy to make you do some shopping and dine at a restaurant. Enjoy!"
692,2017-10-23,4,"I have passed by here on my half marathon, and wanted to check this out for years. Finally did. Otters are sooooooo cute! they are very playful! Feeding time is extra fun. In addition, they have jerry fish penguin, many other kinds of fish. Nice aquarium."
693,2018-05-20,5,"Awesome experience. Perfect place to bring your family, lots of activities for kids to do. My nieces love the aquarium and all of the people who work there are very knowledgeable and friendly. Highly recommend it!"
694,2017-11-25,5,So much fun! It's great for people of all ages. Our kids had fun and ya adults had fun! The penguins are adorable and the otters are cute too! The aquarium is huge and there's a lot to see. Great location and we found $10 parking close by. Totally worth it!
695,2016-09-26,4,Really beautiful aquarium! You definitely need to visit if you're in Monterey. We arrived when feeding time was underway. We grabbed a good spot in front (not to block all the kiddos) and saw some cool fish. We probably sat there for 30 minutes watching all the different types of fish swim by and the bigger guys. They have so many varieties to see and different rooms and exhibits showcasing the different species. Hands down my favorite wad the jellyfish exhibit with the illuminated background. You can really zone out watching them. They also had a tank with a shark! The larger fish like tuna and mackerel were super cool to watch float around. It is a little pricey -$50 entry for adults. But you'll want to spend at least half a day here to take it all in. It's great for kids - lots of activities and learning opportunities for them.
696,2015-02-22,4,"You had me at sea otters!!!I love all things and creatures from the sea. Even sharks. This place is magic for all things sea creatures. The downtown Monterey is super cute. If you're a member, you can bypass the lines to get in. They are all well appointed lines. Just wait in line and go or swipe your card! Either way will get you into this massive, beautiful and super squeal worthy aquarium. First thing you notice when you walk in is that massive outdoor patio. The water is so blue and beautiful. The sun is shining! You can sit and take in the views for a good hour. Sea otters~ this one cute exhibit can be view from both upstairs and downstairs. If you want to see the little cuties floating, sleeping, sun bathing, swimming!? Go up! You'll be right next to them! Well next to a glass but it is pretty cute :) They also have a pretty cool cafeteria. Lines are massive on a Saturday of course. Once you're done with that area, go up and check out the jellies! So many beautiful kinds of jelly fish! Many colors, shape and forms. One can spend hours in here. The massive room with sharks and turtles were so fun to watch too. Puffins? Yes! Octopus? Yep. They have them all. Oh so cute, fun, funny, pretty things from the sea! It is a cool spot for both kids and adults. Bring your walkable shoes, cameras and you're set. It is $40 for adult but it is worth every dollar. Don't forget to get your hands stamped if you go out to the patios. Grab the map and go explore!"
697,2018-05-16,3,It was good experience and we touched stingray so unexpectedly soft and smooth. It was good photo opportunities but wished there were more to see. One of the tanks there was being cleaned out so missed opportunity there. Absolutely kid friendly.
698,2015-04-03,5,"If coming to this aquarium is not on your bucket list, it should be! This is an absolutely amazing aquarium. I've had the pleasure of visiting this aquarium several times over the years from the early 90's to my last visit just last year. It is consistently rated as one of the top 10 aquariums in the world.  What makes this aquarium unique is that it is essentially a part of the bay. Ocean water is pumped in throughout the exhibits, filtered for viewing clarity during the day and then unfiltered at night to bring in the food/plankton. The centerpiece of the aquarium is the huge Kelp Forest exhibit. In addition to the bay water that is provided to all the tanks, there is a surge machine to mimic the surge in the ocean waters and the top of the tank is open allowing the kelp to receive much needed sunlight.All of the exhibits are well maintained and really a joy to view. I found the Jellies Exhibit especially mesmerizing. The jellyfish are so relaxing to watch. The sea otters and penguins are fun and playful. There really is something for everyone.The volunteers here are wonderful - always willing to spend time and educate visitors about the exhibit.  Who knew it was the male seahorses that became pregnant and gave birth?The aquarium is committed to the conservation of the oceans. They sponsor a program called Seafood Watch which helps consumers, restaurants and businesses to choose seafood that is caught or farmed in ways that don't harm the environment. They have even designed an app to help individual consumers determine whether they are making choices from sustainable sources.The aquarium offers an annual open house when it allows locals to visit for free - usually a week or so in December. There is plenty of parking - lots, street, garage, but be prepared to pay. It goes without saying the aquarium will be crowded so try to visit during non peak times, but if that is not an option plan plenty of time and be patient. There is a café and gift shop on premises. In my honest opinion, this is well worth the price of admission. I will visit again when I have the opportunity to visit my home!"
699,2016-11-19,5,"Fantastic aquarium!!!! We showed up around 1pm and waited in a bit 10 second line to get our tickets. 160 dollars for 2 adults and I kid (thats with Military discount.) My kids really loved everything about today. Giant fish tanks, tons of fishes, and fun things for kids to do. My kids were entertained all day! Bathrooms are kinda annoying considering how many people where there compared to how many bathrooms there were. Loved everything about today! Cant wait to go back!"
700,2017-10-08,5,"Brother the fish are really biting here! Seriously, don't put your Tom Johnson in the old petting pool or you will get a nasty snap and a security guard will show ye to the door.Now I wasn't much for the old gills-n-glass crowd in days past, but brother there ain't a thing wrong with this fishy flop house. I mean as a species we went from scooping up the buggers by the net full to creating fancy glass enclosures for the wet and slimy bunch.Now if you are here for the grub, hard pass. Too pricey! And boy howdy those stuffed animals are a hoot! The kids run wild here and the adults are very pretentious and superior acting, but whatever. So if you are in the mood for some dark halls, bright fish, and a real bone jammer of a time then turn the old leg paddles towards this to do."
701,2018-11-12,4,"Soo much for kids to learn, do and explore! A little expensive for a one time trip but when i think of how much we should be donating for this cause, it's totally worth it. That giant tank with the hammerhead shark separating the school of fish when it swims is just awesome!!!"
702,2018-05-19,4,"Very expensive place, but we had a great experience! We even got to see some real wildlife outside, both seals and otters playing in the ocean. The facilities looked clean and the fish had nice environments.It felt a little crowded, so we stayed away from the feedings."
703,2018-10-11,5,"By far, the nicest aquarium I've ever visited. The jellyfish expositions and otters where our favorite. Definitely a must-see!"
704,2017-01-04,4,"The food at the cafe are surprising good and not too expensive (for its quality comparing to restaurant). Love their display and it amazes me each time seeing it. Great for the kids and adults. Once again, the only negative is how crowded it was but I am not going to deduct stars from it. Recommended for people of all ages."
705,2018-10-09,3,Love the aquarium but hate that membership renewals are sub-contracted out to another company that constantly calls my cell phone almost daily to try and get re-subscription.
706,2016-08-26,5,"It is a great aquarium and probably the best one in California.  It's also very expensive and can get very crowded, even on weekdays.TIP:  If you want to see any of the special shows or feedings, I strongly suggest head to the exhibit and be present at least 15 minutes ahead of time.  Otherwise, you (and your little ones) may be stuck behind 4 rows of people with no view at all.  Think of it like a happy hour with 10 cent beers and trying to get the bartender's attention behind 25 other people.  (Possibly not the most appropriate analogy but you get the idea.)There is plenty to do and see and you could easily spend 3 or 4 hours here or possibly even longer.  It really depends on how much you want to do and see.Lunch hour is pure pandemonium and good luck finding (or not finding) a table in the cafe.  The cafe's food is darn good (but pricey) but everyone seems to prefer Cindy's (and it's just just slightly pricier).  If you want a more relaxed dining experience, I'd go with Cindy's but MAKE RESERVATIONS WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER THE AQUARIUM.  Got that?  If not, read it again.  Now, you're welcome.  And if you actually want to eat at a table at the cafe (because they fill up very quickly), I would try and eat either before noon or after 1 p.m.Save a few bucks in parking fees by parking in the residential area east of the aquarium and walking a few blocks down the hill.  You can do it.  It's good exercise.The Open Sea feeding is not to be missed.  It is incredible.Also, no one seems to read about the history of Cannery Row which is located smack dab as you enter the ticketing area.  It's very well done and well worth reading.  Spend 15 minutes in this area, seriously.Overall, aside from the crowds, this is a great aquarium."
707,2019-04-20,5,We decided to become members because the ticket prices for membership were reasonable and we wanted to support the aquarium's mission of conservation. The exhibits are always well done and educational. We love to see the otters and giant  octopus and jellyfish exhibits. Our kids enjoy the touch pool and we're so excited when they were able to touch a sting ray. Wonderful place to spend a few hours enjoying the wonders of our ocean.
708,2015-09-03,5,"Boy this place has really grown up! When I first came here about 30 years ago, it wasn't much. But now it is incredible. Their exhibits are beautiful, educational and generally have a very knowledgable person there to give info and answer questions. The animals all look healthy and like they are thriving.And the conservation these folks do is amazing!Definitely recommend a trip to the aquarium. You will not be disappointed."
709,2017-12-13,5,"What a beautiful place!  Took about two hours and looked at everything, except we couldn't see the otters from the top deck.  Way too many people, and we came on a slower week day.  So much to see and also they have petting pools.  Our daughter loved it! So glad we came!  A bit expensive, but we don't get to come here every weekend, so it was ok to spend a bit to come.We would definitely come back."
710,2018-01-24,5,"This is probably one of the best aquariums in the world, from the overall exhibits, to the staff, to the demonstrations. We came for the afternoon, and my grown 24 year old ass still felt like a little kid and learned all about the ocean again. I loved seeing the sea otters get fed, checking out the penguins, and petting the sting rays. Not to mention the thousands of fish, octopi, jellyfish, and all the other sea creatures around. If you have anytime in Monterey, you should definitely definitely stop by the aquarium."
711,2019-05-04,5,"We are lucky to have a world renown aquarium in our local area. It is a facility for education and coastal conservation. It is handicap accessible, good for children and all ages. Can be crowded on weekends and holidays."
712,2017-04-17,4,"We are long time members it's worth getting the yearly passes with guest passes. We live 4 hrs away so we typically get a Hotel room. Engaging experiences for kids at all ages. My kids have been going since they were 5 and now are teenagers. We love the addition of the Baja exhibit which has geckos, frogs, etcGreat educational displays if your child needs something for a school science project!Honestly I just go for those darn adorable otters! Can't get enough of their cuteness!!Tip: go during the week early morning to beat the crowds ( they hit around 11). You will spend maybe 2.5 hrs there so hit the wharf for lunch don't eat here. Too expensive."
713,2017-09-04,5,"I love the Monterey bay aquarium, I think Ive been here 10 times and never get sick of it. If you buy tickets online, you need to print them out ahead of time. Parking is in any of the garages in the area, there's no dedicated lot for the aquarium. If you're hungry, the cafe inside isnt bad. Food at these types of places are usually garbage but not here! I highly recommend the lobster Mac and cheese and also the tomato bisque. Yes it's overpriced, but that's expected."
714,2018-10-31,5,Beautiful facilities with friendly knowledgeable staff. A must-see when visiting the peninsula.
715,2015-01-30,5,"Rain or shine, the best place to visit is the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Located in Cannery Row, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation started planning phases in 1978 with construction costs of $55 million. David and Lucile Packard's one-time personal gift made it happen. On October 20, 1984, Monterey Bay Aquarium opened its doors to 10,681 visitors on opening day. For sci-fi fans, The Aquarium was also featured in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Remember the scene where Spock swims and communicates with whales in a fictional whale tank? * Photography Tip: Non-flash photography is appropriate. Flashes may cause stress to the sea life on display and can ruin guest experience in the darkened corridors. Also, please leave tripods at home or in the car. The legs can cause a tripping hazard for children and/or a high fall for your camera.In the Kelp Forest, Pacific Sardines are expert synchronized swimmers as they move together as one. The sardines in a large school make themselves look larger to predators. The display of twirling movements and shimmering scales make them look almost mechanical, reminiscent of The Matrix Sentinel Squids as they descended upon Zion.One of the biggest attractions at The Aquarium are the cute, playful Sea Otters. In the mornings, they are either floating on their backs and resting, rolling and playing with the toy sea kelp, or on the rocks sunning themselves or crunching on ice. * Tip: Check for Sea Otter Feeding Times and arrive at the exhibit 30 minutes before to stake out a spot. The sea otters will often get really close to the glass for some really cute, up-close and personal photos as the trainers work with them.The Jellies Experience showcases different species of jellies. Interesting facts about jellies: They are more than 95% water. They do not have bones, brains, blood, teeth, or fins. They can also grow and shrink based on their food supply. The Black Sea Nettle lives in the Pacific Ocean and drifts in offshore currents. They can grow to more than 3 feet across with tentacles that can trail over 25 feet in length. Moon Jellies are alien-like and look like small moons swimming around. The great thing about jellies is that they are living art. The Aquarium has created the perfect backdrop and lighting for you to view and photograph these beautiful creatures. Head outside and see Life on the Bay where you can view wildlife in the bay. Watch Southern Sea Otters resting, playing, and eating on the kelp beds. See Pelagic Cormorants fly and dive as they feed in flocks. You may get a top view of a jelly floating in the water. Or spot a Harbor Seal curiously swimming around the jets of rocks near The Aquarium. If you plan on eating outside, be mindful of your food as the Western gull is eyeing your food too.The Splash Zone & Penguins lets you explore where rockfish, sharks, and penguins call their home. The African Blackfooted Penguin are from South Africa. With the cold currents along the South African coast, these birds ""fly"" through the water to chase squid, anchovy, and other small fish."
716,2018-01-16,5,"I've been here countless times, going back to probably first grade. I never get tired of it! That being said, since I love going so much, I try to find the best deal as a local. I live in Salinas, and starting in September, the local libraries give out free aquarium passes to anyone with a library card. They run out quickly, so go as soon as they start giving them out ! It's one sheet of paper with a unique code that gives admission for up to six people, so you can bring 5 people with you. Just be sure to bring your ID and library card with you along with that paper the day you choose to visit. It's usually valid from Sept.- May I believe, which is great for planning a day to go. Also, during a certain time of the year, the Aquarium allows Monterey County residents free entry with just their california ID as proof of MC residency. If you're a local, look into these options! If you're not a local, admission price is still definitely worth it! Get there early, like when it opens to make the best of it because there is a LOT to see. Allow yourself at least 3 hours to see everything, if not more, especially if you have kids because they'll want to stop and play in the Splash Zone and other kid-oriented areas. Hope this helps!"
717,2017-01-13,4,"We stopped by the Aquarium before heading home after Thanksgiving break when we went to visit Monterey.  The aquarium is always nice and clean, and is impressive how well it's ran.  There's so much to do there for kids learning wise, and it's the perfect opportunity to have them do something fun with also learning about sea creatures too.  They have tons of attractions there.  Really cool huge tanks with awesome fish, sharks, sting rays, and other stuff swimming around.  They have different showcases where you can watch them teach you about penguins or sea otters and you see them interact with them and feed them.  4 stars not 5 though because of how much it's still a rip having said all of that lol.  $50 is a lot to look at sea creatures."
718,2015-02-11,5,"This place is amazing! Definitely worth the money to see all the underwater exhibits that they had. We came here spontaneously after doing a spartan race in Monterey and everyone had a good time. It's huge, it'll more than likely take a few hours to see everything inside. They have shows  throughout the day, so be sure to look at the brochures for show times. Pick out your favorite show and be there early! First ones there get a full view of the aquarium, and if you don't, you'll more than likely have a sucky view. There are so many good exhibits, like the shark tank, the tuna tank, the little tiny horsefishes, and sea otters. But my favorite would have to be the jellyfish exhibit. There was just something about them that was almost hypnotizing to look at. It was just one of those things I had to spend some time watching for a while to try to appreciate its beauty. It was also cool to see some hammerhead sharks up close and personal and the otters play with some toys and with each other, man are those things quick in the water. The only bad part is the parking, There is no dedicated parking lot or structure for the aquarium. We parked several blocks away, but we didn't mind the walk. Overall, it was an awesome experience to see all those sea creatures! I would definitely recommend it to everyone!"
719,2017-06-22,5,"I went here about a week ago. Watched a lot of movies about sharks, etc. The cafe was pretty good, the atmosphere was cool and the prices were decent.Only thing I didn't like was there was a small amount of sharks, otherwise this was an amazing aquarium"
720,2017-11-12,5,We went to the aquarium yesterday with a large group of family and navy veteran. I was a  little nervous with it being a holiday weekend but it was very well staffed. I am always amazed about how great the aquarium look and how professional and polite all the staff is. As always a great time
721,2018-01-09,3,"We were told this was ""an experience we should not miss"", that it was the best Aquarium on the west coast, thus the high prices they charge. It was $45 per ticket, we bought 2, to go as a couple (thank goodness we did not have others or children going along). We were absolutely not amused with these costs; while the building was newer & very clean inside, the costs were simply too high for this experience. Neither of us thought this 2 - 3 hour experience was worth the $90 we spent. We would not recommend this location to others, use your funds for other things in Monterey; like to shopping on the wharf and eating at a waterfront restaurant."
722,2019-04-27,5,"Aquarium is world class of course! We have an annual membership & it is worth it. We also enjoy the amazing gift shop. There is always something special. Beautiful cards, books, decor for your home, gifts, t-shirts & so much more. Be sure to check out the sale section. The cashiers are always helpful & courteous. Excellent marine life & always amazing! After we leave the aquarium we take a drive down the most beautiful coastline on the peninsula, Asilomar State Beach! Another treasure of the peninsula!"
723,2018-04-27,5,"Love this aquarium!!! We bought annual passes and take anyone who is in town to see it. The sea otters are adorable but my favorite exhibit is the jellies! They have several different jelly tanks in a dark room it's really peaceful and beautiful. The open tank is pretty cool and they have a sunfish. There's an octopi exhibit that's interesting and not to be missed. This is a moderately large aquarium so prepare to be there awhile. Oh and don't forget to check out the penguins they swim along the tank, it's really cute. On a side note I would come later in the day, it's super busy early with lots of field trips and kids running everywhere."
724,2018-03-28,5,"He Aquarium was absolutely amazing! The exhibits were accommodating for the animals, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I was able to buy a very comfortable jacket from their shop, and everything sold was beautiful. I would highly recommend it as a destination."
725,2018-07-31,4,"My family had a great time at our first visit to the aquarium, the kids loved all the exhibits and there as a lot of variety in terms of what we saw. The large deep water tank was absolutely gorgeous, and the jelly fish were the star of the show! I also loved that while we were waiting to come in, they put bracelets on my kids with our phone numbers on them, just in case for some reason we were separated accidentally. Some draw backs were the hefty price of admission ($50) and the cafe/restaurant in the aquarium were a little expensive, but also just too crowded for us to even attempt to eat at, so we left and had lunch on Cannery Row. Also, the feedings (like the otter feeding and penguin feeding) were so much fun to watch, but they definitely need a better system for organizing all the people that come to watch. Standing 10 deep at the glass of the tank with people pushing and shoving, was not ideal for our family. Lastly, in the touch area with the Bay Rays, they definitely need an aquarium employee making sure that people are behaving appropriately. There were kids splashing water toward the Bat Rays trying to ""force"" them out of their hiding area, and throwing sand at them from the bottom of the tank to get them to move. Some adults (like me) said something to them, but no one from the aquarium was around to ask them to stop, or escort them out. I just felt bad for those poor animals! I prefer then Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, but this aquarium was great too. A few small annoyances, but overall we had a really good time."
726,2018-04-08,5,Great place to spend with the family went there today had a good time. Love the penguins and sea otters
727,2014-12-10,5,"Long before I was old enough to know that aquariums were tourist attractions and that there is almost one in every major city, there was just the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I'd stare into the great big tank and just ooh and aww over the giant turtles and then the sharks would swim by. Scary and awesome!Over 20 years later, I still get the same feeling standing in front of that big tank. It just never gets old, nor less amazing than the first time. This is as good as it gets to being in the ocean and being one with the animals without having to get wet or risk being swallowed by a whale. The only whale at the aquarium is a hanging sculpture.On my last visit I was fortunate enough to catch the seahorse exhibit. They were so cute and captivating. There are lots of things of interest at the aquarium and for all ages. From the amazing natural backdrop of Monterey, the Pacific Ocean, watching people kayak, spying the sea lions, to amateur scuba diving and snorkeling, feeling a starfish and showing up for feeding times, as soon as you get a hold of that map you gotta plan your day!The aquarium is pretty big and when you wander from room to room it can get overwhelming. I remember almost going crazy just trying to find an exit. Don't fret. If you want to step out and return, just get your hand stamped.Don't miss the penguins, sea otters, jellyfish, turtles, and stingrays. Pro tip: If you don't want to pay for parking, park a few streets down in the residential areas."
728,2015-11-07,5,"This place was great for our 21 month old. Plenty to explore and a great Childrens area full of slides, toys, and a massive water bed :-). Recommended for families of all ages. Key tip, Marriott nearby has 2 day passes for the price of one day!"
729,2018-09-16,5,In the beginning we were shocked by how much they charge but in the end it was well worth it. This is not so much about quantity but quality and there are plenty of volunteers and staff that give you a great education and entertaining experience. We spent 5 hrs in the aquarium and had to drag our 3-year old son out. Good half/full day experience. Would come here agin but once a year seems enough.
730,2018-09-04,3,"Maybe it was the hype of it all, but we were slightly disappointed with the aquarium. Yes, it is a first class space, and has a huge amount of exhibits and things to learn. But you can't possibly enjoy it all with the amount of people/kids that are in there. You're packed into the place, most of the rooms are fairly dark and you're trying to avoid stepping on any kids. On a positive note, the cafe looked pretty amazing and all the food looked good (though I didn't eat any, the prices were a little high). I recommend the Long Beach Aquarium and I felt it was almost as good with way less people."
731,2016-07-03,5,"My 400th Review!I love visiting aquariums!  Monterey Bay Aquarium is quite a treat!! The layout is great and there are many areas to explore!We ended up getting a hotel + aquarium package, so I didn't really pay attention to the admittance fee.  I'm sure we paid for it without much of a discount.I could watch the sea otters play all day!!  When we were here several years ago, there were otters in the ocean near the observation deck in the tide pool.  This last time we were here, they were way out far away, but we could see them through the scopes mounted on the deck.  They have otters inside, in the aquarium, so you can get an up close view of them.  If watching the cute little critters here isn't enough, then they also have a short film about them in the theater.Ok, enough about those cute otters which fascinate and entertain me!  This aquarium is sectioned into different viewing areas.  They have jellyfish, seahorses, lots and lots of fish, penguins, sharks, and so much more! They have a daily schedule for feedings, where you can watch while they feed and talk about the animals.  You can watch the Sea Otters,  Penguins, and an Albatross.  There's also feedings in the Kelp Forest and Open Sea.  Should you become hungry at some point in your day, there are places to eat in here.If you want to learn more or plan your day there, you can download their app called Aquarium App.  If you can't make it to the aquarium itself, you have the opportunity to take a virtual tour using Google Maps Street View.  You can access that by visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium website and click on Start Your Tour.Don't forget to stop by the gift shops!  So many cute things to see!I highly recommend a trip to this awesome Aquarium!  Plan a weekend, stay at a nearby hotel which offers Aquarium Packages (for 2 days visits), or just buy your tickets.  You won't regret it!!"
732,2016-08-23,5,Bottom Line: An amazing place to spend a day....but $50 a head?!I have been to this place a few times and most recently last weekend and we had a blast.  This place really does have a lot to offer - two days' worth of fun....but the price is steep.  Just make sure to get there early!!!
733,2016-07-09,4,"I don't think they're a terrific, spot-on aquarium, but I did learn some things during my trip here.  Conveniently, the aquarium is at one end of Cannery Row.  On the other end of Cannery Row is Fisherman's Wharf.  I did a bike ride down the whole strip and further north/then south to the 17-mile drive, and I definitely recommend it!  Parking is free down the street where houses are, or you can pay $10 for all-day in the lots around Cannery Row.  There's also some metered spots along the street by the American Tin Cannery.  In the morning, there's a line trying to buy admission tickets.  Do yourself a favor and buy them online.  You can just go to the entrance to have your tickets scanned.  They do have stamps for re-entry.  If you're an aquarium member, then you go through a different line.  Prices are now $50 for adults.  I think you save $5 or $10 for being a senior or a student.Penguins are my favorite!  I was disappointed they didn't have more penguins here.  But I enjoyed watching them being fed.  During the penguin feeding event, I like that they take questions from the audience.  I got there early to get a spot in the front, but they made everyone in the first few rows sit down so people in the back can see.  That's nice for people in the back, but what a waste of time on my part trying to get there early.. There are kids running around everywhere.  While that's great for the kids, I found myself waiting impossible amounts of time to get better views of some exhibits for kids and families to leave.  The windows of the deep sea/kelp forest exhibits are foggy and dirty.  Be careful at the end of the first floor.  Don't accidentally take the exit across from the restaurants because you actually leave the aquarium and have to beg the member holder line people to let you back in.I thought the exhibits about being environmentally friendly were creative.  There were some pieces of art that were made entirely from junk or recyclables."
734,2016-09-01,4,"The boyfriend took me here as a surprise day trip for us and I have to say, it was pretty cute. Lots of fish tanks filled with the cutest fish. My favorite would have to be the tanks filled with jellyfish.The price to get in however, is quite high -especially for the family or couple who is on a budget. So make sure to bring your Student ID with you, no matter what grade or age you are. It's $50 for adults (ages 18-64 or without college ID), children 3-12 for $30, any seniors (65+) are $40 and any person with a Student ID of some sort $40. You can also grab a behind the scene tour for $15 a person.There's tons to do here, with a very cute cafeteria area with very fresh food and tasty desserts / snacks. The downside, is the crowdedness in the dining area. It's pretty crowded and many people kind of just hang out in here. There's a cute 'touch pool' where you can feel stingrays and such, so remember to bring hand sanitizer for yourself. Lots of Snapchat & Instagram opportunities, lol. Also, if you play Pokemon here, there's tons of water Pokemon around."
735,2018-10-02,5,Always a fun experience. My children love going to see the otters.
736,2018-06-16,5,"World class, modern, and incredible. I try to visit at least once a year and I'm always impressed."
737,2018-10-17,4,"I used to love coming here when I was little, it seemed you could spend all day here. I decided to go back with my fiancé & had a good time. We were really only there for a few hours, & the entry price was a bit more than I expected. It was a total of $100 for the 2 of us. They have some great exhibits though, good photo ops, & a great view of the bay when you walk outside. It almost impossible to find parking though, we drove around 3 or 4 different parking lots/garages but didn't find a spot for 30 minutes. There aren't any parking lots/garages within a couple blocks unfortunately so you may have to park a little far away if it's a busy day. It was a fun day altogether, just a little more pricey than I expected."
738,2017-08-12,5,"Isn't it ironic you hear sigourney weaver's voice upon entering the aquarium which also happens in the movie finding dory? Hmm.. Been coming to the aquarium since I was maybe 10 or 11 and my it has expanded the last 30 or so years. Some of the exhibits they added from what I noticed is viva Baja and tentacles  on the 1st floor. For those planning on visiting the MBA for the first time, check if your work has special discounts, they do help with the price of the tickets. Come here early and make sure your patience is in check, this place does get crowded pretty fast. Also good to come here 2 hours prior to closing, not so crowded. Pack food and snacks for your lil ones, they will get hungry. Keep your kid(s) close to you, they can easily wonder off when they see something fascinating. It does take about 2-3 hours to see and experience everything. If you happen to be staying in Monterey, it's great to come back later in the day and visit the areas your kid really enjoys. My lil one very much enjoyed the splash zone, the open sea area with the school of fishes circling the ceiling, and the tidal wave area. All the staff here was very friendly and patient especially with so many kiddies running around."
739,2018-01-22,5,Such a peaceful and calming environment. love love this place. I know the prices are steep but there is a way to get your bang for your buck. Just think student. there you go!
740,2018-08-14,4,"It was about 92 dollars for my husband and I, they offer student and military discounts. I really enjoyed the tour, it was very crowded so we didnt get to have any hands on experiences or looks at every tank hit still was nice."
741,2018-07-07,5,Awesome aquarium! Make sure to see the feeding at 11am in the large tank. Get there a few minutes early to get a seat in the front. My 5 year old was very entertained. There's a lot of interactive exhibits for kids.
742,2014-10-05,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is about 130 miles from where we live but it will always be worth the more than 2-hour drive.  The exhibits are quite remarkable and both the young ones and the young once will surely have a wonderful time.  The Jellies Experience is an easy pick with those haunting sea nettles and cute little jellies dancing and glowing, but it is the ""Finding Nemo"" aquarium located at the Splash Zone that is my runaway winner.  It has the clownfish (Nemo), blue tang (Dory), and moorish idol (Gill) represented, among others.  If I could bring a couch, I would put it right in front and have a ball with those characters.Marvel at the size of The Open Sea and The Kelp Forest or get your hands literally wet at the Touch Pools.  However, don't forget to step outside and appreciate the splendid seascape, too. There's a lot more to say about what the aquarium has to offer, but I thought of using the rest of this space for the benefit of the photo enthusiasts like me.  During our last visit, I was approached four different times for DSLR-related questions.  Some people were apparently eyeballing my LCD monitor, which I really didn't mind.  I was happy to oblige because getting quality photos here is a bit of a challenge due to a variety of factors - low light condition, moving objects, and the tripod and flash restrictions.To start with, please don't forget to TURN OFF your flash.  This is for the safety of the animals since some of them are sensitive to light.  Do NOT shoot in full-auto mode because that will more than likely pop up your camera's flash.  If you have a DSLR, try experimenting at home before coming here, particularly with your camera's ISO setting.  This will greatly help with the unfavorable lighting inside the aquarium and will let you realize how much noise (grain) is acceptable to you.  For me, you can do a lot more with a noisy (grainy) but sharp picture than with a noiseless but blurred one.  Most of the subjects are moving, so learning the ""panning"" technique can be beneficial.Ideally, you would want a camera body that supports high ISO sensitivity and a fast lens (maybe f/1.8) in conditions like this.  Throwing away all the rules of thumb regarding focal lengths, shutter speeds, f-stops, and other variables, see if this will be of any help to you and your camera:o  Set your camera to Aperture priority (Av or A) mode.o  Adjust your f-stop to the widest possible value to allow as much light into the sensor (this is actually expressed as a fraction; if you see F3.5, it denotes f/3.5 and it is wider than F5.6 (f/5.6)); take note that this will change if your zoom lens has a variable f-stop.  This means that you have to avoid zooming in your lens.o  Set your ISO to 1600; this is a good starting point.o  Now the fun part: Point your camera at your subject and meter it by half-pressing the shutter; take note of the shutter speed displayed on the viewfinder - if it shows 1/50 or faster, then there is a very good chance that you will get a sharp (but a bit grainy) photo.  If it is in the range of 1/13 to 1/40, you can still give it a whirl but you will need to be really steady with your hands.  Shooting at 1/4 to 1/10 may be quite a stretch.o  Whether you get the desired shutter speed or not, fully press the shutter then review your photo.  If you're happy with what you took, then you're on your way.  Otherwise, adjust the ISO to the next level (3200) and re-focus on your subject; keep adjusting the ISO until you get a decent shutter speed.  If you've reached the maximum ISO level, then the camera and lens may not be suitable for low-light conditions.  You can still play with the exposure setting but you will have to settle for a darker photo.I am by no means a professional, but I have been able to take some decent photos by following the steps above.  I use these guidelines also when shooting inside a restaurant or any place where there is insufficient lighting. You may have to do a little bit of post-processing to clean up some of the noise or adjust the unwanted color cast by manipulating the white balance, but those are for another day.   Good luck and I hope this helps! =)"
743,2018-09-27,4,"Great what you can see there, with 50$ is much but worth it! Was a lot of fun, think 4 hours are a good time you should spend there!"
744,2018-04-10,5,"I've been coming to the Aquarium since before I can remember. I can remember when the Outer Bay exhibit was new, and how awesome it was to spend the night next to the fish tank in ocean camp, or dodge the splashing bat rays in the petting pool.I'm a lot older now, but the aquarium is more amazing than ever! I still enjoy all the things I did about the aquarium as a child, but now I appreciate the message of conservation and awe about the natural world in a way that never registered with me consciously when I was a kid. The otters are always cute, the kelp forest tank and Monterey Bay exhibits are like old friends, and the new rotating exhibits are always fun looks into other parts of the ocean or parts of the world! I 100% guarantee that if you take your kids here, they will have a blast (and learn a ton in the process, maybe even get inspired!), and the adults in your visit will see the world just out of human sight off in the bay in a new and inspiring light."
745,2016-11-20,5,Probably one of the best aquariums I've visited. We had the two day pass for price of one day through the hotel we stayed at. All the exhibits were cool but the jelly fish one was my favorite.
746,2018-09-24,5,"By far the best aquarium I have been to, (Sydney AU, Boston, San Francisco, New York, Waikiki). It is pricey, (sorry), $50 for adults, $30 for children as of 9/2018. Try to go on a weekday so you aren't shoulder to shoulder with weekend crowds, not to mention weekend traffic.The 3 story kelp forest tank is impressive. It feels as if you are walking underwater with rays, sharks, sunfish, tuna, and others I can't remember. The jelly tank is great. There is a large, dark amphitheater where you can view jellyfish pulse swimming slowly. It is hypnotic. If you have kids, the sea otters should not be missed. The outdoor tidal deck is a great place to get for some sun on your face. I could easily spend the whole day here. Try to schedule your trip so you can view some of the feedings. Located at the end of the tourist trap Cannery Row. The Steinbeck picture of Doc and the Boys or George and Lenny (""tell me how it's going to be George"") is long gone, but we should not forget tough times. If you are in the area, and it is within your budget, you should go."
747,2018-07-26,5,One of the best in the US. Get there early to avoid the crowds that increase as the day goes on. Jellyfish are spectacular.
748,2016-08-15,4,"I had high expectations and so did my fiance. I think she had much higher expectations because she thought it was just ""meh."" The most spectacular attraction here is the open ocean live feeding. It was mesmerizing to see the blue fin tunas, and the other schooling fish eating the chum. After that experience though, everything else was just....... kinda... EH. We paid $50 a ticket and I did not feel it was worth that much. I'd pay $20... but definitely not $50."
749,2019-04-20,4,"So, walking in I was looking forward to seeing some beautiful fish, but feeling bad because they are right next to the ocean but confined in a tank. (But not any kind of activist in any way) I was pleased to see and learn much, not only about all the animals but also, about our impact on their environment. I was sad to see the exhibits on how all the plastic junk we use affects them, but glad to learn this information so I can adjust my habits accordingly. I was then impressed that the cafeteria does not sell anything plastic. Nothing. They give free water if you use one of their reusable cups. Free? In an aquarium? These people are in it for more than the money! Yay! Right? Eh...Not all the way. I went to the gift shop and was blown away to see all the plastic junk they were selling. All the stuff they were showing in exhibits that kids lose at the beach and then gets whooshed out to sea to pollute the ocean. Hmm, maybe stop selling that stuff and people will take your message more seriously AND you won't contribute to the problem. All in all, a beautiful, educational experience, but get rid of the plastic junk in the gift shop please?"
750,2016-12-02,4,"Love seeing the jelly fishes and feedings of penguins and sea otters. Going during the week is better than the weekend, but it's usually crowded anytime of the year.Great place for kids and education!"
751,2017-05-13,5,"The Bottom Line - One of the best aquariums you'll visitThe Great - One of the best aquariums you'll visit.  Deceptively large, it has multiple unique exhibits with a wide variety of aquatic life, as well as sea otters, birds, and jellyfish.  The aquarium is built up against the Bay and includes great views of the Monterey bay and some outdoor exhibits - and outdoor wildlife.  A nice touch is an information sheet with all of the various daily activities (feeding times, etc.) so you can plan accordingly.  The Not so Great - Parking is extremely expensive, with nearby lots costing $10 or $15, and street parking can be a challenge.  The aquarium is also quite pricey at $50.  Nonetheless, it is worth the price."
752,2018-09-22,4,"Great place to visit, however it is very expensive.  Many better things to do in the bay area if you have kids and want to not spend an arm and a leg.  If you don't have an issue paying the high price for the tickets go enjoy!"
753,2019-04-05,5,"I have gone for over 15 years and it is the BEST!  Great staff, exhibits and overall atmosphere.  Even when it is full, you still can appreciate the wonder of it all.  I always learn something new and appreciate everything the staff does."
754,2019-04-05,5,We visited the aquarium on Thursday April 4th. My girlfriend and I come down to Monterey every April for our birthday month. This year we happened to mention that to Rae who was working at the ticket counter and she gave us both birthday pins. She was very friendly and very helpful. We then met Christine just inside who noticed our birthday pins and took us behind the scenes to touch jelly fish! She was awesome and explained a lot about the jellies to us. All in all it was an amazing experience and we will continue coming here every April.
755,2017-12-19,5,My husband and I went to the aquarium as a quick get away mini vacation. It was super fun very interactive as well. I touched a sea cucumber ! It's a big place with stunning views . I will def go back here with my entire family. I had a great time. I was able to get some really nice photos while at the aquarium.
756,2017-07-11,5,"TL;DR: Probably the best aquarium you'll ever visit.Going into my long road trip from Southern California up to Northern California, I knew that the Monterey Bay Aquarium had to be a stop for me. You always hear about it from people have visited it, ""It's the best aquarium anywhere."" Well, Yes, it really it is the best aquarium anywhere!The price is a little steep at $49 for adults, but it is worth it in my opinion. I love aquariums, but this one has everything you could probably imagine. We are talking from Penguins, to sharks, to local birds and even have an excellent representation of sea life in Baja California. Everything is clearly labeled with images and words which takes the guessing game out of what you are looking at.Some of the tanks here are huge! We are talking two maybe even three stories tall. Also all the fishes have plenty of room to roam around so it does not seem as if they are cramped into their tanks. On of the main tanks gives you a good view of some deep sea life which is not always portrayed at aquariums. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has done an excellent job of curating quite a diverse collection of sea life.Visit it, you'll regret it if you don't. Yes, I know the price is steep, but it will be a great experience everyone in the family can enjoy."
757,2017-06-12,5,"What is there to say that hasn't been said about the Aquarium? Their mission is to bring awareness to our environment, oceans and its inhabitants, which I find incredibly noble. I appreciate that each and every exhibit ultimately sends a strong message about our impact to the Sea/environment with our lifestyle. They all in some way challenges us to do better. Their exhibits and activities are engaging for people of all ages. I especially liked the auditorium with videos that takes you the behind the scenes. Animal feedings are always great to be part of. Who doesn't like touching sea creatures? Everything makes you realize and appreciate everything that goes into running such an incredible facility. No matter how old you are, how little or how much knowledge you have of the Ocean, and what you consider fun, this facility is incredible!"
758,2018-09-19,5,"This is one of the places that my husband and I love to visit every year or so since we started dating 8 years ago. Now that we have a 2 year old daughter, she makes this aquarium even more enjoyable for us. It is really crowded on weekends but it doesn't keep us from having a great experience;  however, at the sea otter exhibit, it gets really crowded during a feeding and you have to get there early to be able to see anything. I think the aquarium should renovate this area to be more accessible and open so everyone can see what is happening. They have a TV for people in the back to view what's happening but it's not the same experience."
759,2017-08-14,5,"Enchanting and magical! Be prepared to fall in love with SEA OTTERS big time!! Visiting from Berkeley, we drove down to Monterey on Friday night and were there for about 5 hours on Saturday. Tips: - Buy tickets online in advance because the ticket line is long! I bought my tickets online from AAA and saved $5/person. - Arrive when they open at 9:30am. We found street parking with no time limit (was $1.50/hour) just a few blocks away.- Go first to the sea otter tank. It was relatively empty when we arrived but by the early afternoon, there was hardly room to stand on the podium. - Go to a couple of the 15 minute programs. We went to the Luna one (about one of the rescued sea otters) and the Baja one. Both were great, but the Luna one really tugs at your heart. Went home with a sea otter stuffy. How could you not? Both programs were expertly narrated live by volunteers. It was infectious being around such passionate people. Overall, this aquarium really is not to be missed. The only downside to it is that I'm disappointed to see the admission prices these days. It was $50/adult and about 12 years ago (my old Lonely Planet tells me), it was only $22. I understand that it's necessary to keep the crowds at bay and it's for a great cause, but sad that it's not as accessible for working families. :("
760,2016-06-02,4,"Good selection of marine lifeLove the creative signs, informative displays and decorGreat education videos and knowledgeable staff to narrate and guide us. Nice seats in the small auditorium. Touch pools and educational play area for kidsLots of staffLove how live feeding in the giant tank with the informative scuba diver and speaker interactionQuite clean for a busy aquarium (RR too!)Overcrowded Chaotic during peak season/daysOverpriced (gift store is awesome, but pricy)Cafe food is not great for such a nice place and price**NOTE: Not their fault but maybe they should have a staff member telling people outside the bench area to NOT FEED THE PIGEONS!! They have signs but it's not enough! A family member was totally shatted on by a big fat pigeon, diarrhea style! (It got on her jacket, pants, beanie, all over her walker, water bottle, bag and splattered on her son-in-law too!) Nasty!!Would like to see the rest of the exhibits one day without the massive crowds (if that's possible) since I have a membership now. (Cheaper to get a family pack than pay for one day.)"
761,2014-10-04,5,"It's definitely a great place to take out-of-town visitors!  At $40/person it's a pretty fair deal considering you can spend hours on your own with the various exhibits.  They have feedings, interactive exhibits (you can pet a stingray!), and lectures and movies too.  Stamp your arm with their UV temporary tattoo for in and out privileges for the day!Some of our favorite exhibits were:Jellyfish - all sorts of different sizes, colors, and textures set across a beautiful blue-sea background.Cephalopods - lazy octopi of various sizes, nautilus, squids, and cuttlefish.  The videos showing the hunting and stealth skills of these animals were funny and worth watching.Deep Ocean - this is the gigantic aquarium where they put some of the biggest fish: hammerhead sharks, bluefin and yellowfin tuna, and the cute sunfish that tends to hover.  They have a couple of big manta rays too.Shale Reef - the anemones are so colorful, and it's cool how they have lens where you can see close ups!  This section tends to have lots of crabs and fish camouflaged against colorful backgrounds.Sea Birds - they have penguins which come up to you when you look into the glass.  Plus this real crazy sea bird that was flapping its wings in the water and making a huge mess.Another good thing about this aquarium - tons of benches and seating areas for resting, and lots of outlets to charge gadgets!"
762,2017-02-13,3,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium was fun, beautiful, and educational. Many people had told me it was above and beyond other aquariums, but I did not find it to be particularly impressive when compared to the Seattle and Long Beach Aquariums which I have visited in the past. Admission is very pricey (around $50 per person depending on your age/student discount), and while the money goes to research and perservation, it is still a steep price for a few hours in the aquarium. On weekends, it is overcrowded, especially with small children. There are few docents and when parents are not paying attention, the children were often rough with the animals in touch pools and tapping harshly on the glass of the tanks, not to mention screaming, running, pushing, etc.The Open Sea exhibit was easily my favorite section--it features a huge tank with schooling fish, two sea turtles, and a hammerhead shark. It is fascinating to watch the fish move as a group, and the tank is big enough that the bigger fish can stay out of sight of visitors if they choose. The jellyfish are also impressive, but the area can get crowded, and it's hard to spend as much time there as you would like. Parking is only really available in $10-20 lots in the surrounding area, which is inconvenient, but if you plan to spend a significant part of your day on Cannery Row (where the aquarium is located), it is worth it. Overall, I'm glad I went, but it's not a place I would plan on visiting again."
763,2017-09-29,5,"Loved this aquarium when I booked the tickets,Loved this aquarium when I saw the kelp forest and the other exhibits.Loved this aquarium even more after I saw the PBS Documentary."
764,2018-01-25,5,"One of the few places I support that works with animals and marine lifeThe Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the few places that I support that works with animals and marine life since I've read and seen footage of animal cruelty situations (primarily in zoos and circuses). My most recent trip was while I was exploring SF we decided to stop by. I've visited this aquarium many times as a child since we would come up here each summer on the way to a summer camp. There are a lot of researchers that work out and with this aquarium. I read stories of injured sea otters, fish, and even sharks being injured, nursed @ the aquarium, and then later released into the wild. I appreciate that the end goal is to get the marine life back into the ocean where they belong. If you know of any horror stories of animal cruelty here please let me know because I won't want to recommend a place that does not help and only seeks to monetarily benefit. My favorite things to see are the jellyfish, puffer fishTraveler Tip: There is a chilly breeze that often blows through Nor Cal so bring a sweatshirt and windbreaker to stay warm. Overall: This is an absolutely beautiful aquarium in a wonderful little town of Monterey. There are plenty of outdoor activities and natural wildlife to see outside as well.I'm a fellow traveler so I appreciate when other people have given me tips/recommendations while in a new city. If this information is helpful, please let me know by hitting the like button. Even if this review helps only one traveler then it's worth it to know I'm contributing towards making someone's experience better, giving to the global community, and paying it forward. Safe Travels!"
765,2018-09-30,5,"Always an enjoyable experience. Pleasant and helpful staff, knowledgable and eager to communicate. My favorite exhibit is this little happy fish in the baja section who always seems to be smiling."
766,2016-08-22,5,"I took my parents and my 6 year old niece to Monterey Bay Aquarium and they had a great time. There was plenty to see and we spent a good 5 hours absorbing all the information.The shows were entertaining and definitely a one time watch. The section for jellyfish, sharks and penguins were pretty amazing. I would not really recommend a membership as it may not really interest a lot of people who have been to seaWorlds and other aquariums worldwide.It is definitely worth visiting at least once."
767,2017-08-31,5,"This was an excellent reason to visit Monterey!!! We planned a Cali road trip ahead of time and included Monterey for the sole reason of visiting the aquarium. We went on a summery Wednesday afternoon and were not overwhelmed with tourists or kids. Parking was easy to find and we showed up for both the penguin and otter feedings on time and had no trouble seeing either. The otters are sooooooo cute! Besides the otters, I recommend seeing the jellyfish. the tanks with the schools of fish, and the deep sea exhibit. While we didn't see any whales or dolphins from the back deck, it's a beautiful view of Monterey. The price was worth it, especially because so much of the funding goes into preserving ocean wildlife. We showed up at 1:30, took our time and left by 4. Check this place out!!"
768,2018-08-31,5,Fun for all ages! The last time we came was 8 years ago. Not much have changed but it's still exciting to see the sea life and touch the rays. My kids loved the feedings and shows. I was able to bring in my water and kids snacks. They still wanted the big cookie from the cafe. Oh well! It was worth every penny.
769,2017-09-21,2,"Overpriced and overcrowded. Exhibits designed for children more than for adults, despite the $50 per adult admission fee. Parking was far. No whales or dolphins. Lots of TVs simulating aquariums. My husband and I got a grand total of 2 hours of looking at things after paying $100 to get in.My first time here was in 2005 and I loved it back then, as it was my first aquarium experience. My last experience was Sept 2017. Lots has changed, and not for the better."
770,2016-06-15,5,"It's a great place to spend the day. I picked up 2-day passes at the hotel (for less than a 1 day pass) we were staying at nearby, and it was definitely the way to go. By having ticket in hand, we did not have to wait in the long line to purchase tickets on site.The feedings were fun to watch. The Open Sea exhibit was my favorite."
771,2018-02-20,5,Lots of cool stuff to see here! Super busy on weekends. $15 all day parking just up the street if your lucky otherwise street parking is available. They also allow re-entry here so you can walk cannery row and come back if you want! Cool exhibits.
772,2014-08-13,4,"The last time I went to Monterey Bay Aquarium was back in elementary school. My childhood, naïveté, explorative, inquisitive years. I remember the aquarium being bigger and not as crowded... and I was able to touch the bat rays!Zoom by 15 years and I guess it's summer....but being a Thursday, there was a SEA of people waiting to SEE the exhibits. It was super crowded and super humid. Looking at the sea creatures just wasn't as satisfying or as enjoyable as what I would feel on a normal non summer season when the aquarium is less crowded and less noisy. I wasn't even able to touch the rays and people were disturbing the animals and patrons by taking flash pictures!Tips: 1) come earlier in the week to avoid crowds 2) bring a DSLR camera! Your after-the-fact-picture-scrolling-reminiscing-self will thank you3) WHERE TO FIND FREE PARKING: what Judy H. said below, drive past Cannery Row (the aquarium) and on OCEAN BLVD, drive past all the parking limit signs until you don't see anymore and you're safe! You'll enjoy a 10-15 min leisure walk and see the seals and the ocean enroute the aquarium."
773,2018-05-19,1,"So absolutely disappointed in the quality of the exhibits now. It's been 15 years since I had been. I remember being mesmerized by the number of fish and the variety of the exhibits.  I've been telling people not to miss it. Now? What the heck are you spending your money on MBA?  I kept searching for all the fish in the kelp forest and open sea exhibits, but then realized there just weren't any except for a handful. And what happened to all the variety of jelly fish? You are raking in literally thousands of dollars an hour on admission fees alone. Where is it going?"
774,2017-08-09,4,"So much to do, so much to see! So first, getting here. You'll find parking garages around the area, for $15, so just park and walk-in and buy your tickets. Admission is a little expensive ($50 regularly), but they have slight discounts for students, seniors, and children. All the information can be found on their website, which is extremely easy to navigate. I would suggest taking a look at their website first to plan your visit. They tell you that you can finish seeing everything in 2-3 hours, but we easily spent almost 5 hours there. All the exhibits are extremely large, and everything is really clean. It's super kid friendly too, with the touch exhibits and all the buttons you can play with. Every exhibit is very informational, if you take the time to read all the signs and listen to the videos that they have to offer. They have an outdoor area for you to just enjoy the bay too! So lovely on a nice day. It does get SO crowded here though. We wanted to do the 11:30 otter feeding, but ended up waiting till the 1:30 just because of how many people were already waiting. So tip! If you do want to see the timed exhibits, I would suggest showing up at least 20 minutes early to get a spot. But be mindful of the smaller kids who can only see so high. Also food is really expensive, but you can't bring in your own food, so unless you plan to wait until after everything to eat, be prepared to spend a good amount to be full. Although I'm sure all the money goes back to the aquarium to support their cause. They tell you all about the rehabilitation and conservation efforts that they have."
775,2019-03-24,4,Great place if you love the ocean and it's many creatures. It's 360 sardine tanks is really something to see. Of course who could forget those cute otters :). If your looking for something more vicious like sharks they only have about 5 kinds only about adolescents size of course. The one downfall about this place is the amount of visitors it gets. It's hit or miss no matter weekday or weekend on how people you can expect to visit the aquarium with. Be prepared to be patient and to have lots of little ones weaving in and out and all around to get better views. It's hard to find a clam place to watch and get a good look at the tanks
776,2016-07-17,5,"If you haven't been here before or to the Academy of Science, you will be in complete awe by this place.My favorite thing about this place is admiring the cute sea otters. The only downside to this place is the crowd. People kept shoving me left and right. Kids kept kicking me in the leg and running into by elbow. Tip: Arrive before 10:00 am if you want a decent place to park."
777,2017-08-01,4,"Awesome aquarium! I was so happy that we were able to come here. It's definitely a great place to bring kids. They have a lot of interactive displays, playgrounds and touch pools through out the aquarium. It's a very big aquarium, but we were able to go through it pretty quickly. There's a restaurant inside and multiple gift shops through out."
778,2016-07-04,4,"Finally got a chance to take my daughters here. Tip #1 - maybe don't come during a long holiday weekend. What should have been an easy under 2 hour drive over from the Bay Area took over 2.5 hours, not including an unscheduled lunch pit stop. I guess everyone has the same idea, and there are small roads leading to Monterey, so you will be stuck in some serious traffic mess.We finally made it, and love the wharf of Monterey. It's definitely a tourist trap, but it's a nice touristy area. The aquarium wasn't really what I expected - I actually was envisioning an Atlanta or Chicago caliber aquarium. But this was on the smaller side - still really nice inside, but not as vast as I had hoped. And especially for the $50 ticket. (secret - check your credit unions - I was able to get skip the line tickets for $35). Decent exhibits, but again too crowded to really enjoy. My fault really - I should have known it was gonna be crowded.So after parking for $15, tickets, snack at the snack bar, gift shop, and dinner nearby, it made for quite an expensive roadtrip!But why not. You have to visit here once."
779,2018-01-05,4,"If you are interested in sea life, the ocean, or learning something new, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a very enjoyable day for adults or children alike!  My only negative comment is that the price is too high at $50 per person.  I live an hour and a half away, and would come much more frequently, but I would not keep paying that price.  Maybe they marked it high, knowing they'd still get enough 1-time visitors, as it is very busy, especially on the weekends.  You can spend the entire day there, as there are several mini-lectures/feedings near various exhibits, that last around 15 minutes each, but people will start gathering several minutes before.  I would recommend getting there right when it opens, so that you have the option of listening to any of the lectures that interest you, have some time to browse the shop, which also gets crowded, and you can buy a snack or lunch in the café at the aquarium.   If you are one who skims through the exhibits, then you are in walking distance from Cannery Row, several good restaurants overlooking the ocean, etc.  It is a nice day enjoying the California coast & sealife.  The jellyfish exhibits are mesmerizing, and there are penguins, otters, and a multitude of other sea life to experience.  If ocean life isn't your thing, then, for $50, I would not visit the aquarium; but most likely if you are in Monterey, you have some interest in the coast, and it is definitely worth checking out at least once.  It is also a good option if you are from out of town, and it is a rainy day, since it is indoors."
780,2019-03-04,5,"I took a friend, and it was her first time and she had an absolute blast! What really started off the adventure on a really great foot was the fact that there was a girl name Audrey that greeted us with moon jellyfish in a glass cylinder and she was so informative, super sweet, and her customer service was outstanding! We ended up seeing her on different shifts throughout our day and she was exactly as she was the first time we met her, super outgoing informative and super sweet! You definitely have an all-star player on your team and we both want to commend her for making our day out standing, on top of all the exhibits, she was definitely the icing on the cake! Audrey definitely represented the Monterey Bay aquarium how it should be represented! We will definitely be coming back and hopefully she will be there again. As we left we actually ran into her for the last time where we had an absolutely great conversation and she was able to explain some of the questions that we actually had about jellyfish and we both ended it with high-fives and big hugs! You have an employee that definitely goes above and beyond! Thanks Martin and K!"
781,2018-01-21,5,My daughter and I had an awesome amazing time! One of many memorable moments we will cherish! I am truly happy that we made the 300 mile trip! Starting point from Visalia Ca to UCDAVIS (swooped her up) then BAM! FUN FUN FUN!!!
782,2017-09-03,3,"To start with the positive, the facilities are beautiful and the animals here are so interesting. We especially loved the jellies, otters, sharks, and sea turtle. Full disclosure: we visited the aquarium for the first time today over a holiday weekend. Taking a day off during the week when we knew it wouldn't be as busy, wasn't going to happen anytime soon so we rolled the dice on what to expect. We lost our gamble. From the time we arrived to the time we left, there was a line, wait, or struggle to get to the next thing. We bought our tickets (the cost is ridiculous) via iPhone before we arrived so that cut down our initial entry time but that was our only workaround. We showed up about 45 minutes after the aquarium opened and it was already packed. Instant mayhem consumed my senses. There were simply way too many people to enjoy anything. Other Yelpers have gone into detail about the close quarters here so I'll spare you the gory details. Suffice it to say, there was no level of serenity or ambiance in observing the wonderful ocean life here. It was a mess and so were we by the time our adventure ended. If the only way to enjoy this place is on a weekday, we'll pass going forward."
783,2015-06-18,4,"We had been out in Silicon Valley for about 9 months and spent a lot of time in Monterey/Carmel on the weekends.  We walked by the aquarium many times and were very intrigued.We noticed that the lines out the door last August and September were quite long.  We finally went to visit this past May on Mother's Day, we arrived at the aquarium around noon and the museum was still quite packed. As to be expected, there were a lot of children running around.  The aquarium has so many great exhibits, I would recommend spending about 4-5 hours there.We took a peek in the gift shop, souvenirs were very expensive."
784,2016-09-06,5,Beautiful and not too crowded. They need more restroomsAnd more seating area for feeding times
785,2017-11-27,4,"Another must stop attraction if passing through Monterey, CA! The views are beautiful, as the building is an old cannery that is on the coastline. Tons of educational materials, diverse attractions, good food and souvenirs. My favorite was the kelp forest. Make sure to head to the top floor to get an outside view of the entire kelp forest structure. There are tons of children friendly educational exhibits so make sure to plan on staying a while. My favorite educational exhibit was getting to pet a sting ray! And don't forget to support the aquarium by purchasing any of their wonderful gifts in their numerous gift stores!"
786,2016-07-10,4,"Findings to help with your visit:1) Monterey bay can get cooler even in summer, so dress appropriately.2) It should be easy to get 4 hour street parking nearby, particularly if you are early. Kids usually are quite contented with the visit within 4 hours. If you want to spend more time, one can always walk back to the car to extend the parking and come back with the stamp on the hand.3) Feeding sessions, the quiz and show in the auditorium, the outdoor show on ""The story of Monterey Bay"" all make the visit really worth, so don't miss them.4) Use the map to plan your stay, so that you don't spend a lot of time walking back and forth inside the museum.5) Auditorium shows fill-in very quickly, so need to be present in the queue a few minutes before the show.6) Remember to use hand-sanitizer (available near the exhibit) after touching the sea life.Enjoy the splendor of the sea world that the aquarium portrays!"
787,2014-09-21,5,"Yes, yes, YES!This is the best display of aquatic and marine life that you will find! I love coming here even though it's super expensive, and I will say that it is something you will NEVER regret ever seeing. The place is HUGE and they have so many different rooms with different subcategories of different animals.I've been a huge fan of aquariums since I was a kid and first developed my obsession with sting/manta rays as my favorite animals. AND YOU GET TO PET THEM HERE. I frickin' love getting to pet the sting rays. When I went here with my friends, they practically had to pry me away from the display. They hands-on rooms are so cool, where you get to pet things, pick them up, touch them, etc.I recommend you purchase your tickets online (I did), otherwise you may have to wait in a somewhat large line for admission. Definitely one of the best attractions in Monterey Bay. And I'll definitely plan on coming back, not only for the sting rays, but just to refresh my memory of the jelly fish tanks, and other interesting sea creatures we often don't take much time to think about or appreciate.Love Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
788,2017-09-03,4,"We went here for Evenings by the Bay, which was from 6 pm to 8 pm. You can get small bites fir $5 each. You can get 5 tickets for $20, which is essentially buy 4 small bites and get one free. You pay at the front and they give you one ticket per $5 or the 5 for $20.  You take the tickets and pick up small bites from the tables. They had tomato soup and grilled cheese, cornbread and bbq chicken, bb spare ribs and coleslaw, beef sliders, Mac and cheese, funnel cake, oreo cake, tarts, salads, and few other things. There was also a bar for drinks and live music for the 2 hours with dancing. Lots of people were having a great time AND you don't have to pay extra for the 6-8 pm entry. It is included in your ticket.However, the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is the event was a little too loud for me! And the food was all clumped together, which made it hard to walk. It bottlenecked and people kept cutting my in line so I couldn't get food. I recommend having a better line - do better line control or have the tables spread out a bit more. This spread out the crowd. The staff could direct people or provide a map or sign that shows where to get certain small bites.Anyways, aside from the event, it was fun. Honestly, without the event, I think it was overpriced, but they can charge alot since it is a huge attraction in the area and it supports the wildlife - so at least it goes to a good cause.We arrived earlier though to walk around the exhibits. Definitely huge! And I loved the educational bit related to the aquarium. I learned what seafood to eat vs. not eat to save our environment.  And the otters were so cute and the deep sea, big tanks we're the coolest.If you have a car, then parking is tough, but I think the aquarium might have parking. We stayed downtown so we took the free trolly to the aquarium. It was about a 15-20 drove and the trolly comes every 10-15 minutes at various stops. It was so hot though that the drive was pretty miserable so we decided to walk back after the aquarium event. Took us 20 mins to walk and was a nice by the Bay walk. I recommend walking. You get to see stores in the area too.Overall, good trip. It was a surprise for my birthday that my fiance got me. If you go on your b-day and stop by information, they give you a happy birthday pin to wear the whole day :)!!!!T"
789,2016-07-15,4,"+ Park your vehicle in the east/west garage. Address: Tyler St, Monterey, CA 93940. Catch a Free shuttle between the parking garage and Aquarium (Old trolley, pretty exciting ride). Parking fee here is $7 and is the cheapest. Plenty of parking available. If you go closer to the aquarium its all mostly roadside parkings.  + Decent amount of exhibits/shows for a day+ 5-6 hours worth of exhibits/shows+ Plan to cover many shows as possible. + Some of the shows are: Feeding @ Kelp forest is pretty informative (4/5), Story of Monterey bay aquarium (outdoors) 3.5/5, Albatrose encounter (3.5/5), Otter feeding (4/5).+ Cafeteria is pretty good, not that expensive+ Spacious lockers available outside that can take quarters (4 * $0.25)+ No outside food allowed insideBiggest drawback is the price. Kids @ $30 & Adults @ $50. That is COSTLY for an aquarium this size. I have visited Aquariums in San Diego, Cincinnati, Atlanta. This is easily the costliest of all."
790,2018-05-09,3,"I don't know what all the fuss is about.... I mean it's cool for a rainy day but i certainly don't love it. It's always so packed, parking is a nightmare, expensive, no shade over the outside presentations, and no seats (or space to stand) for the otters. The only way I would buy an annual pass is if they had stadium seating for the otters so I could watch the cuteness all day."
791,2014-07-09,4,"Hide your kids, hide your wife! Actually, you may want to bring them here. Since I've got neither of these it was a little overwhelming  to be in an extremely crowded aquarium on July 4th weekend. However, the chaos quickly melts away into the background once you get into the exhibits and see the beauty and diversity of life in H2O. Pro-tip: Come with an award winning marine biologist as your guide. Non redonculous Pro-tip: Purchase your pass at the hotel for quick entry via the members entrance. It's the same price and so much better for your sanity."
792,2016-09-26,5,This place does not need many more reviews to convince you that it is a great place to spend a day. I have been to several aquariums and this one by far is the best. They have great use of indoor and outdoor space and there is something great to see around every turn. The larger than life tanks really make the views breathtaking! A must see if you are in the area!
793,2017-11-22,5,"The aquarium is amazing. Staff is all knowledgeable and helpful. Exhibits change regularly. We have been members for over a year and always find new things to see when we go. There is a Lactation room upstairs in the far corner, but it is a bit tricky to find. Staff can help you locate it if you have a distracted nurser, or need to pump.My baby has been interested in the exhibits for multiple months (he's only 8 months old) but during busy hours it can be a bit loud for him. If your child is walking age you will definitely find lots of activities,including a baby play area, dress up area, water play area, touch tanks, and more. This is also a great place for adults. Tons to see. The cafe is not too crazy price wise compared to most amusement parks, stadiums, etc. but it is not cheap either. Cannery Row is not a great place for cheap dining either, so if you head into Seaside you will find a lot of cheaper options. Lots of out guests have complained about food costs when visiting us, so hopefully that helps!Parking can be tricky, but if you park in the mall and buy anything (even a coffee) you can get a few hours validated. There is also often street parking, which is cheaper than the lots. Get there early in the day for better parking and less crowds. Overall, we love the aquarium. Membership is a great option if you come more than once per year and includes other perks, like events. If you are local, they also have locals deals a few times per year."
794,2018-03-15,5,"This place is amazing. They've done an amazing job making it feel like less of a built exhibit and more of being able to just look at a piece of the raw ocean. I loved walking around there all day. It's an aquarium on steroids. My only complaint would be people not controlling their kids and letting them push people out of the way so they could see the exhibits and not letting other people see by standing in the way for a long time, but the aquarium has no control over peoples' kids so I can't blame them. Other than that it was perfection. The otter and penguin exhibits were my favorite places to be. All of the animals were so much more awake and interactive than in any other aquarium I've ever been. I would love to go again one day."
795,2014-07-15,5,"I can't say enough about this aquarium, you simply have to visit and see it for yourself!Yes, it is expensive, but if you admit that it is for a good cause, it can be considered your donation to the environment for the year! Because of the cost, though, plan to stay ALL DAY! There is more than enough to do and see... For all ages!Highlights:- The art exhibit about plastic waste included videos from the artists and interactive stations. My niece loved it and it was a learning experience as we thought about things we could do to reduce our plastic consumption.- SEA OTTERS! They are so fun to watch because they are frisky and playful under and above water.- Birds.... This aquarium has two exhibits with birds: the penguins and the puffins! Both are active and playful and it is awesome to see them ""fly"" underwater!- I loved how you could see the animals inside the aquarium and then go outside and see the same animals in their natural habitat. We saw harbor seals, otters and lots of birds when we went outside to the viewing station.- JELLIES! This exhibit was just beautiful. Visually stunning, these jellies are marine life that are not usually seen. Their connection to the ecosystem was also super interesting to learn about!- Lastly, the kelp forest tank was super awesome. I love that one of their most popular exhibits is an ecosystem that is so integral to that area. Did you know the water for that tank ones in from the ocean?I had SO much fun here and will be coming back to explore it more on my next trip to California."
796,2014-06-13,5,"""Tentacles!""  Octopussies, Squiddies & Cuttlefishies!  Oh MY!SITREPThis Special Exhibition of Tentacled sea-creatures was such a experience to behold and enjoy.  THE SETUPWhat are ""Cephalopods""?  They are related family & genus of sea creatures - such as Octopuses / Octopi, Squid, Cuttlefishes and Nautiluses (these are marine molluscs), related to snails and slugs. The cephalopods are found in all the world's oceans and at all depths and varied in their colors, their sizes, their neonness, and their transparencies (especially the jelly fishies).  Speaking of sizes, they can range from less than a centimeter to more than 50 feet in diameter - such as the heads of some jelly fishes.There are more than 800 known, catalogued & recorded species of cephalopods, and yet they share common characteristics along the foundational aspects of their genus, such as head & eyes, mantle & siphon, arms & tentacles, and a beak & radula.EXHIBITSThere are two (2) main exhibits - though the entire aquarium is swept up with ""Cephalopods-mania"", especially in the Gift Shop! - and they are broken out mainly with the Jelly-Fish exhibit, and then a bigger exhibit for all the Octopi, Squids, Cuttlefish, Nautiluses and related cousins.Each has great under-water demonstrations of these fascinating creatures in their eco-systems.  I actually got to watch a ""cuttlefish-feeding"" - where the staff deployed small anchovies into the water - and watch the cuttlefish go on a feeding frenzy!  It was NOT pretty!  (Fish pieces & shards floating around for a while after the first *burst* of feeding, but then the ""cuttlefish clean-up crew"" coming through and cleaning up the rest).  But was fascinating nonetheless!SEA OTTERSBut while aquarium, all the other main-stay exhibits are enjoyable to see as well, and none was more fun for me than getting to see the antics of the otters.  Swimming around on their backs.  Wrestling each other.  Trying to catch naps and other otters coming up, bothering them, and trying to wrestle with you.  hiLARious!I even made friends with sea-otter ""Whiskey"":yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Such a good time!COSTI know, I know, even I thought $40 was pretty steep to get into the Aquarium (seems to be a lot more than I remember from a few years back).  But I think the value of the information and fascination of the under seaworld was well worth it.The exhibits are very informative and diverse and provide a lot of explanation and science for what how these creatures interelate in their own ecosystems and what impact man is having upon them.THE LOWDOWN""Tentacles"" is a great temporary exhibition that you can see now at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and you really should hurry before it leaves soon."
797,2018-09-13,5,Located in a beautiful area. Really liked the artificial tide tunnel. Makes it very real. Had the membership pass so didn't have to wait in long line. Very crowded n certain days but still exciting.
798,2017-08-06,5,"I've been to many aquariums throughout the world including South Africa, Australia, Atlantis- Bahamas (my favorite) and many in the United States. This is one of the biggest and most fun aquariums. Wow! We spent the whole day here, well besides taking a break for lunch.We arrived at 1030am, luckily we bought tickets online. So our wait was not too long to get in. I would highly recommend doing that. The ticket line looked really long. We left at 6pm thoroughly exhausted but happy with our choice. We went to sea harvest for lunch. There was a wait but totally worth it for fresh non-greasy seafood. We stopped at the perfect crumb bakery on our way out. Very happy we did. It does get crowded at the aquarium so be prepared for that."
799,2016-05-26,4,My wife's roller derby team had a game scheduled in Monterey so we took the opportunity to spend our last day here with baby girl. It was a Sunday afternoon and purchased our tickets in advance so didn't have to deal with the line out the door.  My favorite thing about this place are 2 things the maintenance and the pistachio cinoli. My least favorite part of this place is the penguin room at feeding time. It gets crowded FAST and there is no ventilation. Other than that we had an excellent time!
800,2017-04-20,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is the destination on John Steinbeck's legendary Cannery Row. It's a very immersive experience, with the aquarium literally on the Pacific, and plenty of hands-on exhibits. There are majestic whales (unsurprisingly, the aquarium was used for the beloved Star Trek: Voyage Home movie), delicate jellyfish, plenty of fish.It's a fascinating&informative place, with friendly, helpful people. You can spend hours there. It has a spectacular setting in Monterey, with beautiful views. This place doesn't need to fish for compliments, because it's one of the best."
801,2017-07-28,5,"Of the few world class aquariums I've visited (Busan, New England) this one is my favorite, mostly because the educational aspect is done so well.  A clear effort is made to engage visitors (and not just the kiddies) in learning about the marine environment; technology and creative design are both used to great effect to create an immersive and thought-provoking experience.  Examples of this include the ""Wave Crash"" gallery in the Rocky Shore section of the aquarium, where the effect of waves constantly breaking on rocks in tidal pools is simulated *above and around* visitors with raw and filtered seawater.  It's hard to describe, but very effective and interesting.  The location of the aquarium right on top of the actual tidal pools along cannery row really enhance the experience, with great multilevel viewing decks all interconnected with the aquarium exhibits.Other highlights include the massive sardine school in the open sea exhibit (like a natural lava lamp on a giant scale - absolutely mesmerizing to watch, especially when stirred to action by a pre-scheduled broadcast feeding), the equally impressive ""kelp forest"" tank, the beautifully lit jellyfish displays, the always-active (and larger than life) sea otters, and the many large octopuses visible throughout the aquarium.  It's true that weekends seem to be very crowded, but I imagine that weekdays often get many large groups of children from schools and camps, so I think you have to be prepared for crowds either way.  It's definitely worth buying tickets online ahead of time and showing up early to avoid long waits just to get in the door.  Parking in the area fills up quickly too, so if you're paying the expensive admission tickets, why not commit and show up early to have a more enjoyable experience?If I lived close by I would consider a membership, as otherwise the ticket prices are prohibitive, but it's definitely worth going at least once."
802,2014-06-26,4,"The hubs and I haven't been to Monterey Bay Aquarium together ever in life and he thought it would be a great weekend date. I was hesitant to go because it was a 3 hour drive from Fresno, but I'm glad he persuaded me. It definitely was a nostalgic experience.  Walking around ""under the sea"" was an amazing experience.  I thought I'd be bored, but I honestly thought it was romantic to walk around holding hands ohing and ahing over all the underwater creatures the aquarium had to offer.I totally get why my parents brought my siblings and I here when we were younger.  Not only is this place a learning experience, but it was a controlled environment catered to children where they can touch things, watch videos, and there were no rides or lines!My favorite part of the aquarium were the jelly fish and the octopus exhibits.  I definitely felt like a mermaid there as I was surrounded by huge tanks filled with all kinds of large fish, sharks, etc.We were very fortunate to have been able to borrow member cards from a friend.  An adult admission is $40!  If you haven't been, you should go!!!  But I totally get why my parents brought us here only once.  If you have more than one child it can cost a pretty penny."
803,2014-06-10,5,"My favorite destination from home, a getaway that's far yet close enough to call it a getaway. It's my go to aquarium and my go to city for anything, especially when the weather is gorgeous outside. I bought student passes (woot is college actually paying off) It's 50$ a person and it covers for an entire year, unlimited visits and the members only entrance, sweetness. It's absolutely worth it and I've utilized it to quite the advance. It's absolutely mesmerizing here at the Aquarium because each different exhibit pulls you away from reality for a little bit. Each exhibit is different from the next and there's so much life and history around you. I love the tall, aquarium walls where I can almost feel the animals through and just watching them swim around lively. Each display always have informational plaques with pictures, great for young children and parents. The staff and volunteers do an amazing job of educating everybody who has questions and are curious about the underwater life. I've been here on busy days, holidays and off days and I can tell you there's ALWAYS a lot of kids running around, especially in the darker exhibits. So be careful to not run into one of them, or have them run over you. But it's so adorable to see young children get so excited about being around animal life and willing to learn. The new tentacles exhibit is awesome! Who even knew the different between cuttle fish and squid? I know I didn't but the colors of those sea creatures are just so beautiful. It reflects in the light and they swim so carelessly. There's even a giant octopus in the exhibit and a special speaker that explains everything. Truly great addition to the aquarium, check it out before it goes away. But with the passes, I just come in and out I don't even check out all the exhibits, but I highly encourage you to do so. There's so much to learn and explore and even has to hands on exhibits. Baby sting rays are my favorite and they're super soft at the top of the head. Plus, you can go outside and enjoy the water and the sights, great for outdoor eating and pictures. Take advantage of the fact that the Bay Area has so much to offer, Monterey Aquarium is really amazing. Plus, they have a sustainable cafe and serve local produce and FREE wifi! Free show viewings that are educational and encouraging. There's too much to say but just spectacular!"
804,2014-06-22,5,"AMAZING. I live in San Diego, but my family went up north to Monterey to visit our cousins, so we decided to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium. When you compare their aquarium to San Diego's Birch Aquarium in La Jolla, ours ain't sh*t. Although it's expensive, it's definitely worth it. It's two stories, so it is obviously bigger. The jellyfish section is my favorite part--it's beautiful. Another one of my favorite parts to it is the ""wave crash"", it's as if you're going to go down with the water.I like how this aquarium is much more interactive. There are more play areas for the children, within the aquarium, and the station where you could touch the ""creatures"" has different people who are friendly and answer questions. As you walk outdoors, you could see the big body of water... And people snorkel and such."
805,2017-11-04,5,I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Great selection of water animals and birds.  My favorites are the jellyfish and penguin exhibits.  Be sure to watch the various feedings.  It can get crowded so plan accordingly.  Buy your tickets on line and save some time.
806,2016-08-07,5,"What can I say that hasn't been said?! This place is still as awesome as ever. While parking can be a bit of a pain, if you're out on a nice day the walk around to re-up your meter isn't bad. The facility is clean, and that's one thing I really appreciate; being that there's SO many people there all the time, and that there are so many touching and and open exhibits. The aquariums are large and well maintained, the outside areas have a huge view out into the ocean and onto sea otters. There's a bunch of sea life that you can touch and hold. Many shows and things that you can watch throughout the day. Well adorned walls with info, and facts, art, and huge installations. It's great that they also split up the two main gift shops to make it a bit less hectic. Some really great plush aquatic toys that you just don't see everyday.I only have one gripe but, I'm sure they've already tried to make this as smooth as possible - the food court situation was kind of a shit show. and my clam chowder was primarily made up of uncooked potatoes... Overall - O'll always come back here because of the dedicated staff that take such good care of these animals and maintain this facility."
807,2016-07-16,5,Went on 7/15/16I must admit this was not on my bucket list. My wife and her sister planed the trip and I had to go. Turned out I really enjoyed it. The place is very well organized and things are timed so that it really does not take very long to see everything. I personally loved the shows. There were young women who describe what we were seeing as the show progressed.  They were amazing because it was totally going off the cuff. I am sure they do it daily but the timing was perfect. The had great voices and made the show very informative. I would go back again in the future. Well worth the trip from The Bay Area or further.
808,2017-11-19,4,"Always a pleasure coming to the Aquarium. Ideally we would definitely come on a weekday if possible with having a toddler, it was hard to let her really explore with so many other kids and families since she's so little but nonetheless had a great time and enjoyed everything the aquarium had to offer. She even got a wave from a diver helping to feed some fishies :)"
809,2018-02-03,5,The most wonderful experience my 3 year old had a blast here friendly staff clean environment beautiful sea creatures the only down side wad the people crowding the exhibits very loud and beware some kids are very rough with the sea creatures they let you touch not my child she knows better I felt bad for them but the staff got right on it the scenery outside wad beautiful overall one of the best places I've ever been good for all ages pm
810,2014-05-19,3,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion. I just know it. But I wasn't blown away here. I mean, it's large, and there's a lot of fish to look at, but the way people talked about it, I was expecting to be blown away. I mean, seriously, BLOW ME AWAY with the $39.99 price tag that I had to take a second look at. I don't feel like I've ever paid that for a ""museum"" before. Not in NYC, not anywhere. It was $$$. First off, it's VERY kid friendly, so if you have rugrats, they'll be entertained for hours. I felt like there were at least 3 play areas. I kept trying to go into regular exhibits, and they ended up being play areas. There were some interesting fish though. I loved seeing the octopus, the jellyfish and the large aquarium with the strange looking flat fish that I can't remember the name of, because it was so strange! But the penguin area seemed too small for me, and it was right up against one of the million kids areas. I want more tuxes! And, there's a whole section for Kelp? Really??? It looks kinda cool, but a whole section on a sea plant? Eh. I did love the outdoor area and the hunt for sea otters. Although my blind eyes were having trouble focusing, it was a beautiful view regardless. Moral of the story is, if the price wasn't so high, would I have thought differently about my experience? Perhaps, but it just didn't do it for me."
811,2014-08-28,5,"My  2 year old nephew loved it here!  We took him and my sister while they were visiting from Washington, D.C. and both had a lot of fun.  She had just taken him  to the Aquarium in Baltimore a few months ago and was very disappointed by that experience.  Because of that experience, she appreciated the Monterey Bay Aquarium that much more.  My nephew loved seeing all the fish, touching the sea cucumber and sting ray at the touch pool, and hearing and having the waves crash over him!  He didn't want to leave the Ocean Wave simulation area!  I loved the Penguins, Tentacles and Jellies Exhibits!  It was also fun watching the staff clean one of the bigger tanks in their scuba suits!  We ate at the cafe and were lucky enough to get there before the crowd!  There was quite a line waiting to get into the cafe as we were leaving the cafe.  People were also looking for tables for their groups when we left.  It really pays to get to the Aquarium early on a Saturday.  We got there about 20 minutes after they opened and we breezed through the line for tickets.  When we left at noon, there was a line along the wall by the entrance.  We were on my nephew's schedule so we were only there for a couple of hours.  If you can visit here on weekdays, do it.  You will have a less hectic experience.  Parking is quite steep too ($15 for the day), so if you have the time and energy to drive around and walk, it would save you the $15.  Had we gotten there earlier, I would have driven around to find street parking.We will definitely return here with my niece when she turns two!  It's so much fun watching the kids enjoy themselves!"
812,2017-07-30,5,"If I could rate it ten stars, I would.  The aquarium speaks for itself, even at the now high admission prices, this is a must see.  I'll speak about a bit about the real problem:  crowds.  If you go in with them, you'll miss out or not enjoy your visit.  Target your visit for days other than weekends lest you will be crammed into the place literally like sardines and you really lose out on the experience.  I love their music and drink nights with various themes throughout the summer.  Most of the tourists miss the extended hours that come with these events, often until 8pm, affording you an opportunity to see things during peak periods like a VIP.  It's an absolutely stellar experience to tour this aquarium with live music playing in the background, with a craft beer in hand.  Unmatched anywhere in the world in an aquarium.If you can't make a late night special event schedule, avoid the aquarium until a weekday.  You'll find mid-week during the day to be a very pleasant time to tour at your pace without crowds."
813,2018-09-03,3,"Parents please watch your kids!!!! I understand they are excited and the aquarium is a family place but there are to many people there to let them run around! There are some dark exhibits and it would be very easy for you to loose your child if you are not paying attention. Also, please have them say excuse me and watch where they are going. I had 4 kids step on my feet today and one literally put her hand on my hip and tried to push me out of the way. I have kids so I'm not trying to preach and I understand they get really excited, but please have them use their manners. Other than that the aquarium is amazing and so is the staff!"
814,2019-02-02,5,Crowded on the weekends. If you're a local I definitely recommend getting the annual pass.
815,2017-10-25,5,"It was a date with my husband to remember! We were like kids again playing in those touch pools. The 2 hours drive absolutely worth it! Every single person in the Aquarium are sooo knowledgeable about everything! Too bad we can't touch the baby jellyfish glass hehe (and i know it's for the best of their safety) I love that day! All the positive reviews I've read was all true. This place is perfect for kids, family and even couple!"
816,2017-11-26,5,Differently a must to visit if in the area always so beautiful and fun a bit pricey but if you make a day of it doesn't seem so much$ wise . The kids never get  bored of coming here we will be getting a yr pass this coming up year do to the fact that our 4 yr old can't get enough of this place and is always asking to come employees are so helpful and answer all the questions the children ask we love the touch areas and the kids areas truly a magical beautiful place to visit
817,2017-07-18,4,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is so much better than the Long Beach aquarium. There is a LOT to see here. It's amazing to see all the animals. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because of the amount of people were there.
818,2018-01-01,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is wonderful in every way!  So much great stuff to see...the otters, the penguins, and most of all the incredible jellyfish.I liked it so much that I purchased a membership.  Now I can go as often as I want for no additional charge."
819,2017-11-07,5,"Love this place ever since I first went when I was younger; the drive up from San Jose can be a pain because it feels like you've been driving forever but it's well worth it once you arrive. It's nice to see a lot of workers/volunteers around so if you have a question, etc. there is always someone close by. Plus everyone is super friendly. The cafe is nice but food is TOO expensive sometimes."
820,2016-07-21,5,"My favorite aquarium in the Bay Area. Lots of exhibits ranging from touching pools for kids to actual otters that they've saved. There are also a variety of big fish and octopus. Their cafe even has a few vegan and vegetarian options, which is great. Recommend watching one of their movies when you get tickets. They're really educational and fun! Plus it's always great to learn more about the area you live in or live near. There's even a cool ""cafe"" where you sit down and watch clips to educate you about overfishing and what you should order (if you cannot give up fish) in leiu of more endangered species.Looks like the Monterey Bay Aquarium is doing great work to rescue local flora/fauna too. I love the idea that they're both an aquarium and a hub for scientists to really make an impact on the environment!"
821,2017-09-01,5,"Wow, just wow. Absolutely stunning! We could have spent all day mesmerized watching the fish and kelp sway in the aquariums, but baby had had enough. We were still there most of the day and did get to see all the exhibits. The staff (all of them) were super helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be working,  which made our visit even more pleasurable.  The family and I will definitely be back and highly recommend this aquarium to your family."
822,2014-09-06,5,"I haven't been to this aquarium since I was little, and remembered it being AMAZING. However, I haven't gone back since because this place is a little pricey. Today, I went back, and paid the student price ($34.95) to get in.Yes, it is expensive. There is no arguing that. But the Monterey Bay Aquarium is an experience where you make it how you want it to be! You have to go in there, ready to find opportunities for excitement! Yes, you have to be proactive. Sure, you can come into the aquarium and just wander around, looking at exhibits. OR,... you can do that AND SEIZE AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES AS YOU CAN that this aquarium has to offer! Despite the large crowds, definitely check out the scheduled feeding times! I saw the kelp forest feeding and penguin feeding! After the kelp forest feeding, you can go up to the third floor to see the diver come out of the tank. If he has time, he will even talk to you about his experience and answer any questions you might have. If you have texting, DO text the phone number listed on the brochure the word ""feeding"". They will send you up to date texts about unscheduled feedings all around the aquarium! Because of this texting service, I was able to see them feed the sunfish, sea turtles, and birds without the crowds! Even though they are unscheduled, there were still volunteers at the avian unit educating us on what the birds were being fed! Want to sit down and still be involved? Go to the movie theatre on the first floor where you can watch whatever short film they have on that day! They are usually about 15 minutes long. Today's was about what goes on behind the scenes at the aquarium. It was a great way to keep learning at the aquarium even though I wanted to sit down and rest. Really take the time to look through every exhibit there. Some people tend to just skip over them and just go to the big exhibits. However, every exhibit has something amazing! If you're spending all that money, might as well enjoy every single creature the aquarium has to offer you. Overall, I LOVED my experience at the aquarium. The sea otters were very cute, sometimes even interacting with the audience! The open sea portion was breath- taking, with the huge sea creatures such as hammer head sharks and sun fish! I even got to see a baby sea turtle :) I really enjoyed the jelly fish and tentacles exhibits too."
823,2017-05-23,5,"This place just hit the top of my Aquarium list! Non profit ran, so don't be to scared about pricing for entry. Single Adult is $49.50, however if you're student or military you do receive a discount! Check the website for updates and other possible discounts that may need to be applied on purchases before you go. We went on a Monday, mid morning. It was Crowded. We didn't really mind, because most parents were actually taking care of their kids instead of letting them run wild ha. Try and get there as soon as it opens and maybe wait till after summer when kids are back in school if you don't want to wait to see each exhibit. The Volunteers were Amazing!! I believe one woman's name was Joyce! She was truly knowledgeable, sweet, patient, and really fun to listen to! They thought of everything for kids! Seriously the best aquarium for you to bring kids, and the smallest of toddlers!! Make sure to GRAB A MAP! To make sure you see everything, it can get a little confusing without one. You can also check for certain feeding times, and live viewing programs they show through the day! Ps. After watching Finding Dory, I felt bad for wanting to feel the sea anemone, crabs, kelp and other fun things in the ""touch"" zone. I was gentle and there are plenty of wash stations near by."
824,2018-08-14,3,I have been coming here for years since I was a child. I now bring my children here. But seriously where do they get off charging 49.00 a ticket for my husband and I it was 100.00 bucks! It's always so over crowded now. I love this aquarium and have had great memories here but sad to say I won't be coming back for awhile. It's almost like Disneyland over crowded and over priced it really takes the fun out of it.
825,2018-07-13,2,"Way over priced! Adults act like they have never seen fish in an aquarium, they were in the front of the viewing window with their phones out, so we got a great view of the back of their heads and the pictures of their phones, no regards for kids. Adults were hitting kids and walking away without seeing if they hurt the kid. Blocking the petting pool so they could touch the stingrays we couldn't get close!! This is the biggest rip off!! Go to San Francisco they have an aquarium at fisherman's wharf that you can walk through, and it's less expensive."
826,2018-09-08,5,"Yes, it is expensive, but they sponsor so many programs for sustainable fishing and for local schools to be able to visit at no cost. Wonderful place, very big, and LOTS of exhibits. Worth every penny!"
827,2018-02-19,5,"Amazing Place to VisitMy husband & I had an amazing visit on a very busy Sunday afternoon.  This place is a wealth of information and the staff & volunteers were helpful, informative and kind.  Any questions we had from....where is the restroom to please tell me more about this or that was answered with courtesy and a smile.  I really wish we would have arrived earlier to not feel so rushed.  I would estimate at least 3 to 4 hours for first time visitors to see everything.....we will be going again :)"
828,2018-07-20,3,"We went for the otter exhibit.  The ticket prices are way too expensive!!!!!  WoW $50 per ticket and you can view everything in a little over an hour.  Here in LA, many museums are free or charge very little for entry.  I think this is really taking advantage of the tourists.  Besides the otters, I do not think the aquarium is worth the price."
829,2017-09-23,5,"Awesome aquarium!The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the three best I've seen in the world, just below Baltimore's and Okinawa's. Really a great place and an adaptive re-use of a cannery site that I suspect won a ton of awards. It's stellar to see. The top displays for our family are the jellyfish, the sea lions, and the children's areas. The staff are super friendly and the exhibits do well in bringing you in as an audience. They also have some conservation programs they share information about. And the site is just down the street from Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station for any budding marine science researchers.Only knock would be the price-- adults are $50 each and kids 3-12 years old are $30 each. Our family membership is $225. So, not cheap, but a good investment if you want to support such a special facility."
830,2018-06-01,5,"My daughter went to the Aquarium with her middle school today. This was a special 3 day trip with her science class. My daughter realized she had laid her notebook in one of the gift shops, about 5 min after her bus had left the parking lot. She texted me right away. I called the gift shop and got a recording and left a message. I called back and was put through to Joe Jeffries in security and in charge of lost & found. Joe took my name and number and said he would send one of his men to look for  it. I got a little nervous and called back after 15 min. I spoke to Matt Abbott this time. Matt said after checking with Joe, that it had been found. I explained my daughter needed it as soon as possible. Since the Aquarium's shipping department was closed, Matt said he would personally bring it to UPS store. Once he got there, he had the sales associate speak with me to get my information. After speaking with the associate, who I thanked repeatedly, she hung up. No more than 25 minutes later, Matt Abbott, called to make sure that everything had been handled to my satisfaction. The customer service these two gentlemen demonstrated was outstanding. My daughter said they had a great time and she hoped that we could come as a family on our family vacation! Thank you again Matt & Joe! Catherine Overturf"
831,2016-06-05,4,"My family and I went on a busy weekend, so there were a lot of people which was to be expected. It was the first time going for some of us, me included, and the aquarium didn't disappoint. There is a lot to see and a lot of areas to explore and walk around. Since there is a lot of walking involved, it's important to bring comfortable shoes. There are seats to sit and rest, but if you go on a busy day, it may already be filled with lots of people. Restrooms are conveniently located throughout each area as well.I enjoyed my time here and the gift shops have nice (although a bit expensive) souvenirs. Getting in was quick and easy because we already had tickets. For those who didn't, you had to wait in a long line. I would probably come here again, but not too frequently unless they have new sections/additions or something of the like. Visit the aquarium if you haven't already though!"
832,2017-04-15,1,"So Disappointing. I went to have an exciting and memorable experience and I left feeling annoyed and ripped off. The main issue is the amount of people vs the amount of viewing space. It is virtually impossible to see anything without having to push your way through hoards of self entitled children and their oblivious parents. When you do finally make it to the front you feel like you have to move quickly to make space for the person behind you breathing down your neck. They seriously need to reorganize their admittance policy and schedule viewing times. They also need to ban strollers. Will never go back, sad to say."
833,2019-02-23,4,"We love this place, it is always exciting to take the kids. It can get quite busy so I suggest going during off times, like during the week and not during vacation season. It is a much better experience when it is not overly crowded."
834,2018-08-10,5,This place is so much fun!  It's really busy on summer weekends so be prepared for huge crowds.
835,2018-08-10,5,It was the best my daughter has a season pass we take the kids stay in joy they can run around and learn something as well the overnights in the summer is fabulous look into it .
836,2014-07-06,4,"It was a Tuesday afternoon in May. I decided to call my girls out of school and head to Monterey to the aquarium. I haven't been since I was little, my girls had never been. They knew about it though and wanted to visit. They had no clue where we were going, but were so excited once we got there. I believe for adults it's $30 and $25 for kids? I feel like I spent about $80 for the four of us to get in. Once we walked in, we tried to figure out where we wanted to go. The guide in the front said that people were looking at some dolphins out on the deck, so we headed out there. For days on the coast, we couldn't have asked for a more perfect day. It was probably 75 degrees and sunny. It was literally a picture perfect day. We didn't see any dolphins, like the ones they were talking about. So we headed back inside and started exploring. Like everyone else has said, there are a lot of great and different exhibits to see. My girls loved the jellyfish ones and the sea otter. The only thing that I have to say about the exhibits was I thought there'd be more sea otters? Maybe they only have one at a time now. Either way, the one that was there was super cute!  We went and watched the movie about sea otters and Luna in particular. My girls loved it, they still talk about Luna. Their other favorite part was the area where the water goes over the glass. They probably could have sat under there all afternoon, if I let them. The penguin exhibit was pretty cool too. One of my daughters had a stuffed animal and one of the penguins was following it around through the glass. The aquarium is a great place to come with the kids. They have things to do and see for every age, toddler through adult. It's definitely a place to visit if you're in Monterey."
837,2018-01-13,5,Such a fun place to go walk around and explore. It's beautiful inside and clean. You also get stunning views of the ocean from outside. There's no way you won't have fun here.
838,2017-06-03,5,Wonderful experience!!!  Everything was beautiful clean and the tanks are huge !  They have scheduled feedings cool to watch they explain everything so well. Friendly stuff and a lot of cool neat stuff to buy
839,2016-03-24,5,"Adult tickets are $39.95 which is very steep. However, if you are science nerd like me, the $40 is worth it!It was extremely crowded when we went on a Wednesday in March. The exhibits are packed so you have to be patient. Parking was $30 for us because the cheaper lots ($10) were all sold out. Cannery Row is a very popular place for tourists, so be prepared for the crowds!"
840,2019-02-20,5,"What a continuing gem it is to visit and revisit. It's an informative, well organized, beautiful aquarium in this part of Monterrey, nestled effectively along the Pacific for an added logical and obvious piece of understanding that the ocean, the seas are spectacularly important. My grandsons always have it on their list, when we visit family. They've learned so much marine biology, so many ways that sea life articulates with their environment as well as provides us with both beauty and food sources. They can see the effects of human behavior and choices on the environment and have taken those lessons with them. Thanks to all the knowledgable and helpful staff members there, the well written  informational pieces, and the Splash Zone area."
841,2017-04-11,2,"Am I the only person that was really disappointed by this place? To be honest I didn't want to go initially just because it costs $50 per person, but we had a rainy day in Monterey with nothing else to do, and our hotel offered tickets 2 days for the price of 1 so we decided to go.  I was not at all impressed.  It was SO unbelievably crowded that you could barely see anything.  We tried to see two different feedings, but it was so crowded you could barely see.  We spent an hour here, and I didn't even consider going back the next day even tho it was free.  I would suggest a walk along the Monterey coast to see otters and seals out in the wild for free, or a whale watch trip, which I'm pretty sure would end up much being cheaper and more enjoyable than this aquarium."
842,2017-04-09,3,"Disappointed. In a word I guess that describes the experience. I wish I could say it wasn't even their fault and it was just the experience of being crowded and eeeewwww people, but I wouldn't usually let that skew my experience and I didn't here either. Some of the exhibits are pretty cool, I especially enjoyed the deep sea exhibit, of which I posted a video. The jelly fish were also cool, but I see so much more potential and find its missing. Anyhow, if you wish to visit an aquarium to be beaten over the head about conservation, this may well be your jam. Personally, I visited to see critters and found it lacking a little. Don't get me wrong, they gave critters, but they also have space available for critters, not occupied by critters; instead it's messages about conservation and preservation. I was mildly entertained by the art exhibit made up of disposed plastic, but that wasn't why we visited. I'd even have enjoyed hearing or learning more about their research into their sea life and don't get me wrong while I appreciate conservation is important to sea life ask me to download an app and send me a daily notification about it, that just wasn't why I was here. Why would I visit the zoo to see a lecture about waste management? Yeah I know this isn't a zoo but you get what I'm saying. Was it worth the visit? I wouldn't visit again. Ironically at out camp ground in Moss Landing we got an up close and personal encounter with a sea otter for free, if I'd known I'd have saved the cost of admission; at least we know our admission fees are helping to support the critters."
843,2017-06-26,4,"Great aquarium! I was worried because I thought it was going to take the whole time (10AM-5PM) to see and experience, but my boyfriend and I arrived at 1:30PM and got to see everything in 3.5 hours. We were there up until closing at 5PM, and even at 5:15PM they weren't kicking anybody out. A lot to see, but not overwhelming. Doable in 3-4 hours. Love the care for wildlife here and their mission to restore ocean wildlife back to their natural habitat, especially sea otters. Very admirable. So much to see and do, but nothing extraordinary."
844,2017-03-26,3,"I know I'm supposed to be over the moon to watch sea creatures in captivity with gorgeous blue backgrounds...and I was impressed at times..especially by the jelly fish exhibit.But, then we got to the penguins and wow, those poor birds are not healthy at all :( Please hire the right type of trainers for your sea birds because they smelled bad and looked worked! I have video because I was one of those Snapchat-the-day assholes videoing everything till I saw those birds.. and i had to stop because I got sad.I don't think I ever want to come back here.. my OCD about kid's dirty hands everywhere was going off and causing great anxiety and ill thinking. It's a smidge on the costly side to only be open till 5. I could go off about a couple more things that bugged me but then I just sound like a whiner so, I'll stop.It's probably a great place to bring the kids because I was a bit underwhelmed by this whole museum."
845,2018-01-05,5,"Love the aquarium! We had so much fun there during our stay in Monterey! It can get crowded sometimes but when it's not, it's really a great place to take your little ones and have fun with the sea animals!"
846,2017-06-20,5,"Beautiful aquarium! Loved seeing the otters and penguins. I'm a big fisher""woman"" and what really got me was the huge tank filled with tuna and dorados. I could have sat there for hours just starring at them swim around. Wish it wasn't so far from me or I'd be here all the time. Loved learning more about John Steinbeck and his place in Monterey (I didn't expect to learn anything about him at an aquarium). We ended up buying his book Cannery Row at the big gift store. It's pretty pricey to get in but it's totally worth it."
847,2014-06-03,3,"o5.25.14My friend said, ""you can't go to Monterey Bay without the aquarium"". I replied, ""I can."" I kind of regret coming in here because it wasn't that fascinating. It's pretty much similar to other aquarium, like the one in Long Beach. And I touched a shark at the LB location. Anyway, I still gave it a 3 star because it has two sections with jelly fishes! They're like the cutest thing ever! I've always know they're in different size, shape, structure, and color, but not that colorful! Blue and green jelly?! What?! And up side down jelly?!! Ohhh sooo cute!!"
848,2017-06-24,5,"So this was the apex for our Monterey vacation.  My wife loves this place and this was her choice for the reason why we went to Monterey and it did not disappoint.Of course you know you are going to pay top dollar but well worth it.  We are big fans of the show Tanked so this place was like being in the show.  We got to see a bunch of the fishes on the show and more we never knew about.  I wish they had a Great White Shark display but that is asking a lot.They did have food offerings in their cafe but unless you want to hurt your wallet, I would skip and wait to go check out other options on Cannery Row.I would love to share some of the awesome pics that my family took but it doesn't do it justice.  Go check it out with the family."
849,2016-09-09,5,"My opinion for this place will be a bit biased.  Hubby and I were in town for a conference he attended and one of the features of the week was a private tour of the aquarium just for our group.A private bus took us from the Hyatt to the aquarium in the evening. The interior had candlelight tables spread throughout the main floor, along with a dessert and coffee station.  (I imagine it would be a cool place to have a wedding reception.)Our group walked around for about an hour and a half, and the staff had 2 special features for us, which consisted of a special diver in the big tank, and free feeding of the bat rays.  Feeding and touching the bat rays was my favorite part.  My second favorite was the floor to ceiling exhibit (don't know the name) of hammerhead sharks and massive school of fish.  Hubby and I would've like more time to walk around to absorb everything, but it was still a cool/free event to go to."
850,2018-04-17,5,My husband and I are here for our honeymoon. This was one of the places we wanted to go while we are her. We went there the other day. We both fell in love with it. It is one of the best Aquarium I have ever been to. We will definitely come back here again when we are back in the area.
851,2018-01-29,5,"This place is a touchdown for anyone with children and also for the children, they love it. Also be sure to check out the San Francisco Exploratorium very nice"
852,2018-01-27,5,What can I say. Every time I visit this place I am in Awe. The habitats are so awesome. I will be a continued guest until my last breath. Thank you for the great education from the staff.
853,2017-12-25,2,"It was ok.  I have been wanting to come see this aquarium for months after hearing from others how great it was.  It was very disappointing.  The best exhibit was the jellyfish and the large tank in the center off the aquarium.  Definitely do not recommend going on a weekend or holiday. It was overcrowded by rude pushy people not caring that there was a 2 yr trying to see the exhibit. The touch pool was very disappointing unless you have never felt seaweed.  There were no penguins! How can an aqurium have no penuins?!  Over priced for what they offer, it felt like there were as many gift shops as exhibits."
854,2018-07-17,3,"Visited the aquarium. It was okay. If you have been to Chattanooga, TN aquarium like my family you will be disappointed with this venue"
855,2017-10-21,5,"I love this place ! The open sea show that they do at 11 is incredible! I would recommend getting there when the aquarium opens so you can experience everything . There is so much to do and see. I also did the jelly tour this time and our tour guide Rick was funny and knowledgeable. I enjoyed being able to go behind the scenes and to touch a jelly fish. Every staff member there is incredibly friendly and nice . Also, very sweet that they gave my husband and I pins to wear celebrating our anniversary! Thank you"
856,2018-04-08,1,"Had a horrible experience at the cafeteria. A busboy by the name of Cristian was yelling at my pregnant wife for trying to find a seat at the cafeteria. She was 8 month pregnant and pushing a stroller with our two year old daughter in it for God sake. So once I go to the cashier with our food, she found a table and sat down, he again came by and told her to get up, and give up the table for someone else. I found out later and was furious. Complained to the cafe manager onsite, and she promised to take action. But it seems they've ignored our complaint as it seems to still happen to other people.It's ironic because when my wife travels on airplane, she gets priority boarding since she's pregnant. When she rides on buses, people give up their seat for her. But when she goes to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, she wasn't allowed to sit at the cafe.If the cafe doesn't have enough seating, then you should control the inflow of cafe guest. That's how normal restaurant does things. You don't have a group of busboys going around harassing your guest. It's a bizarre way to run your business.If you don't want to ruin your trip, go to the aquarium, but don't eat at the cafe, or it'll leave you with a sour taste."
857,2016-05-29,5,"We had an amazing time with the exception of the thousands of screaming kids so if you're not a fan of kids, steer clear of this place during holidays and weekends. This aquarium is one of the best in the States with lots to see and learn about in regards to sea life. The exhibits are very informative and there's so many beautiful species of fishes to see."
858,2018-01-21,5,"Excellent experience for the young and old! Bit pricey $49 for an adult ticket, but the experience is definitely worth it. Be sure to check out the Kelp forest feeding with a volunteer diver and penguin feeding! Otters are cute too! The jellyfish exhibit was really interesting and had someone on hand to answer all your questions!"
859,2016-09-12,5,"Can't think of anything to say that hasn't already been said.  Definitely deserves five stars. Go during the week if you want less crowds, better yet, when kids are back in school!  The aquarium was the highlight of Monterey for us."
860,2018-07-14,5,"the best aquarium in the bay area. cool fish, caring staff, and the most adorable otters in the entire world. this is such a humane aquarium, they make sure their animals are treated well. their focus is to rehabilitate and release animals12/10 has a lit timesometime it's kinda busy but that's it"
861,2016-02-09,3,"Coming here as a child will always be one of my most fondest memories. Pulling my mother's hands as we weaved our way through the tunnels of different marine life is something I won't forget. Through the eyes of 8 year old me, this place was a magical underwater kingdom. Through the eyes of current me (notice how I purposely omitted my current age), it's quite lackluster to say the least.Entrance fee is overpriced. General admission= $39.95. Student admission= $34.95But that's not a big deal because I assumed we were going to be in for at least 1 1/2 hours of fun exploring life under the sea. But I was wrong. Our adventure ended in about 45 minutes. And that's including watching the feedings.For the price they charge, I wish there was more to see/learn/do. This will be my last visit until I have kids of my own. Hopefully by then this place will have expanded. If not, I'm sure my mini-mes would still have fun nonetheless.*Get a stamp so you can re-enter at anytime during your same day visit."
862,2018-08-11,2,Honestly I had been wanting to go forever! It was such a let down. The exhibits were small and there were so many pushy people trying to see the same things. I would recommend The Oregon Aquarium or Seattle over this one. It was very expensive. I will say the staff was amazing and very nice and helpful.
863,2017-05-08,3,"I've been here about 3 and every time I'm here, it's quite packed.  The last time I was here was this past weekend.  As I approached the front door, I noticed that the line to the ticket purchasing booth was empty.  So I immediately thought, ""Yeah, this place isn't packed!""  Well, I was wrong.  This place was full of adults.  Every single one of them were either standing in front of the glass (blocking the view of the animals) or standing in the middle of the aisle (blocking people from going through).  After an hour of walking around, we decided to leave.  For the price they charge for entrance, it's totally not worth it.   Good thing I got free tickets for all 3 visits.  I doubt I'll be back."
864,2018-08-21,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a premiere marine treasure that neither resident nor visitor should miss!Our visiting children and grand children were so impressed with the incredible displays of marine life and deep down creatures of the oceans that they returned the next day to view all that the Aquarium has to offer. Young children and adults get a close view and a 'touch 'Experience that is both amazing and instructive. The staff and volunteers are very informative, dedicated and ready to answer questions. Visitors can attend informative programs and activities such as feeding the sharks, how scientists are tracking them, and how they treat their young. Children can take a close look at underwater creatures by participating in a special program using full body wet suites and breathing tanks under the watchful eye of instructors. It is a good idea to check the Aquarium 's website and be prepared before you wonder into the fascinating and intriguing world of our ocean creatures!"
865,2018-08-10,5,"Fabulous as always!  This time we did the Sea Otter tour.  Once was good, don't need to do it again.  Joan, our guide was great!"
866,2014-04-02,5,"Every time we drop by Monterey we head to the Aquarium.Usually after a stop by wine tasting, but still :DMy favorites will always be the jellyfish and their gorgeous exhibit but other favorites include the cute and cuddly otters, the starfish and the large chock-full-of-fish tank.The exhibit staffers are always incredibly friendly, helpful and the numerous and varied exhibits are clean and well-kept.I love this space and I love how it teaches youngsters about the environment and life outside in the deep!"
867,2018-07-23,5,So much to see and a ton of fun!  The kids loved the hands-on play areas.  You can definitely spend all day at the aquarium.
868,2016-03-04,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a one of a kind experience. Simply put, its one of the best aquariums in the entire country that offers just about anything you could ever imagine. The staff here actively engage in making sure every person that comes in the aquarium comes out having learned something new. It's more than just an aquarium where you see animals, you learn about them, where they come from, why they are in Monterey, etc.Some of the animals you do get to see up close are: jellyfish, sharks, stingrays, fish, crabs, lobsters and my personal favorite, sea otters! This aquarium also has many exhibits that go in depth about different species and they are highly interesting!I also can't praise the staff here enough. They are passionate about their jobs and always make sure every single animal is taken care of. They also raise awareness into issues in our society and ways we can help prevent them (all related to animals). Overall, this place is a must visit. Its in the historic city of Monterey- let's not forgot it was our capital in the 1700's- and the location of the aquarium itself is amazing! Right on cannery row. What more can you ask for? Look at some animals, learn their history, then take a nice stroll along the water and grab some food. The perfect day."
869,2016-07-29,5,We had an amazing experience at this aquarium.  The kelp tank was so beautiful and peaceful.  You can stand and watch it for hours without getting bored.  They have massive tanks where you can watch school of fishes dances around.  Lots of things to see and learn.  Entry tickets prices: $40 for students with ID and $50 for adult.  We parking in the small parking lot across from the aquarium for $15.
870,2018-08-06,4,"Me and my family visited the aquarium on a Sunday, so it was a little crowded. Everything about the aquarium was amazing! Some of the tanks were so huge and so rich with life. The ONLY problem we had was that the amount of people made the experience slightly unenjoyable, but that was not unexpected at such a popular tourist location. Overall, great aquarium!"
871,2016-07-28,5,"Being from Chicago we have the Shedd Aquarium which is a great aquarium but we were told that the Monterey Aquarium is a world-class aquarium. We decided to go there as part of our San Francisco city pass and it was spectacular. The aquarium was extremely family friendly and has a lot of hands on activities for kids which the shed aquarium does not have. In addition, the view of the ocean adds to the ambience of the aquarium. One of the volunteers had his telescope set up and he allowed guests to look through his telescope and you were able to see seals and sea otters in the ocean. Maybe this is an advantage of having an aquarium right on the ocean but it's a great advantage. We also learned that teachers get 20% off of all purchases. This made our trip to California coast so much better"
872,2018-07-21,4,"Even though it was a bit crowded my family and I were still able to get around. A bit disappointed on open ocean it seemed too empty and didn't really have enough animals to look at. Loved the stuff they were selling at the gift shop, employees there were super nice had a fun conversation with one I believe her name was Adrienne. Great job! We had a blast."
873,2017-04-14,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one the best aquariums I've been to! :) HIGHLIGHTS: - Several feeding shows throughout the day - during a 2.5 to 3 hour visit, I managed to see 3 different feedings! The staff here is also exceptional at making sure everyone can see the feedings and they'll arrange the audience to sit/stand in a certain way so everyone can see. - The Open Ocean exhibit was my absolute favorite and I think one of the most unique exhibits to this particular aquarium. The sheer size and diversity of marine life behind the glass is mind-blowing. - There's a spectacular view outside of the aquarium where you can step out and just enjoy the ocean air and view. PARKING: - Parking is difficult to find if you don't wantto pay an expensive flat rate at a parking garage. We had to circle around a couple blocks a few times to find street parking on a Friday afternoon. If you have the patience and aren't planning to spend your entire day in the vicinity of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, I would recommend you find street parking; it's cheaper than garage parking for a couple of hours. I only mention a few things that I enjoyed about my visit, but there really is just so much to see and learn here. I highly recommend making the trip here if you're in the area, it's seriously one of the best aquariums!"
874,2018-06-10,5,An amazing venue. Be sure to allow yourself hours to enjoy all the many intricacies..quite expensive! Invest in a membership if you live nearby.
875,2018-01-03,3,Great place. But way overpriced for want you get. I would not consider this place as one of the best aquariums. San Francisco Bay Aquarium has more to see and is more compact.  Academy of Science has more to see and more entertainment. $30 per adult and $15 per child would be a perfect rate for it. $50 for adult and $30 for a child is the current rate.It is not about money is just about value.
876,2016-02-20,4,"Love this place, but have to be honest it's the other visitors that drive me nuts.  I am all for taking a pic or selfie here or there, but people block every exhibit with their iPads and phones that it's hard to actually just see the exhibits.  I have to ask: what's the point when no one bothers to actually experience the exhibits' beauty?  Bragging rights on Facebook?  Maybe.  Add to that parents who don't watch their kids and strollers that hit your ankles, and I realize I shouldn't frequent here during weekends or holidays. When it isn't too crowded, this place is awesome.  The aquariums filled with so many diverse species are enthralling and memorizing.  I could watch the kelp forest all day.  Or the sardines that swim endlessly in circles.  The jellyfish exhibits are equally hypnotizing with their eloquent grace.  They have some new exhibits around trash and human responsibility that are poignant and moving for change. I love the message behind the entire aquarium of conservation, respect, and responsibility, especially since it reaches the younger generations and teaches then to create better, sustainable habits."
877,2018-06-26,3,"So, I get it, it is what it is,  but it seems this place has turned into a kid only fish and otter exhibit with regular reminders of the ecology agenda. It feels like less science, less species diversity and less to do over the years I've been here. It's okay, just be prepared to have screaming toddlers, apathetic teens, and backpacks constantly invade your thinking space as you attempt to read or do anything productive other than just watch fish move."
878,2018-08-02,4,This is pretty straight forward here: the Monterey Bay aquarium has something for all ages. My wife and I have gone multiple times and loved it!  It's fun to walk around and look at the attractions or even do the tours. Today we took our 2 year old daughter to the acquarium for the first time and she loved it. Despite being tired she ended up being engaged in many of the attractions there. The staff is very knowledgeable. Highly recommend visiting.
879,2016-08-08,4,"This place was a fun, smaller aquarium that did a great job of showcasing the naturals elements and history of Monterey. I am a college student and I went with a friend my age, and although some spots are targeted for kids, I feel like people of all ages can enjoy the aquarium.Tip- the open water feeding! Go to it! You'll see a giant blue fin tuna and the coolest part of it to me was watching thousands of sardines in a school rise from the bottom of the tank for their food. A nice little guided presentation with videos screens narrated the whole thing. Get there early because it gets crowded. If you're standing in the front they'll have you sit- so just be aware in case you have bad knees or would rather stand.The kelp forest feeding was also interesting because the diver who was feeding the fish had a microphone and would talk to the audience. Great for asking questions too.If you want to learn the history of the bay, the tide theater had a great, short presentation on the history of the area. Actors and videos gave a natural and historical overview of the area. It tied in really well with the exhibits.Although on the more expensive side for an activity this is worth it. There's a ton to do for all ages and to keep everyone entertained."
880,2018-07-17,5,It's expensive but well worth it. There's so much to see and do especially if you have young children. The staff is always great and the food at the food court is actually quite good. A must if you're coming to Monterey.
881,2018-10-12,4,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is probably our top reason to visit Monterey. We like visiting in the afternoon, because it's very quiet, so we usually plan to be there for two afternoons, and we stay until closing time. Try planning your visit after checking the daily schedule. We like to avoid the feedings of the otters and penguins for example, since it's very crowded, but like watching the feeding in the Kelp Forest, where you can interact with the divers, and it's big enough for everyone to see everything.Don't miss the giant octopus, the flashy fishes (we had a great time watching them play) and the interactive exhibits, like the Rocky Shore touch pools where you can get up-close-and-personal with a bat ray, starfish, abalones, sea urchins, kelp crabs and more.  The Coral Reef Kingdom offers a playplace for infants and toddlers, and a fun mini aquarium with lots of clown fishes you kids can crawl into.If you visit often, and want to try something new, take one of the behind-the-scene tours! We plan to do it in one of our next visits."
882,2017-11-01,5,Impressive! It's an amazing experience for children and for adults. So much knowledge it's put in every aquarium tank which has its own ecosystem!
883,2018-07-31,5,Love love love this wonderful place. Great for families and friends who come to visit. As well as locals. World class aquarium. Always stop at the sea otter exhibit located in the center of the aquarium and try to catch a fish feeding in the big tank. Usually eat before going in as prices can be rather high at restaurant located inside. But this is an attraction you do not want to miss on the Monterey Peninsula. Well worth your time.
884,2017-04-09,3,"We spent the weekend in Monterrey and EVERYONE suggested we check out the aquarium. I was immediately turned off by the cost, $50/person, but based on popular opinion, my wife and I decided to go for it. The best part: There are lots of areas to touch different types of plants and sea creatures. The stingray section was fun. They are so playful and swim right up to you and let you touch them!The worst part: The crowd. Granted, we went on a nice day and on a Saturday, but it was so overwhelming. Strollers and wheelchairs roll rampant in the nearly pitch dark areas of the aquarium, making it hard not to trip over everyone. There are no real suggested directions, so the crowd moves in all directions and they are ruthless. There were definitely some neat things to see, but nothing that stood out to me as to why this place is so unique or a must-see. I've seen the same creatures at other aquariums at a much cheaper price. And I have to say we were shocked at just how rude adults and their children were. Note to parents: If you're wearing your kid, watch who you're hitting him with. And maybe use some discipline on the kiddos who can walk, or run in those case. I'd never go back and, at least for my adult friends, it would be the last place I'd suggest they visit."
885,2016-04-21,5,"This is the best aquarium I have ever been to! They have (almost) every kind of sea animal you can think of. The only downfall was that there were no larger species of sharks which my BF was really looking forward to but they did have plenty of cute leopard sharks. I absolute favorite exhibits were the sea otters and the jelly fish. Make sure you check the schedule so you can watch the sea otters eat. They're so freaking cute! And there's usually an aquarium employee narrating during scheduled feedings which I thought was pretty cool. You definitely have to make time to see the jelly fish exhibit. They are so cool! There are so many different types of jelly fish so you'll want to spend some time upstairs. Overall, I'd say make sure you have at least a couple hours to see the entire aquarium. Everyone we spoke to suggested coming here and I'm glad we did. Great experience."
886,2018-04-29,5,"This aquarium is outstanding and a must see if your in the Monterey area. Friendly staff, cute gift shop and beautiful displays. The jellyfish and the sea otter exhibits are a must see. A+++"
887,2017-02-15,5,"I LAVVVV THE AQUARIUM. It's worth the price value if you don't have a membership or know someone who does and can  let you use their guest passes. Prices are $35-40 per adult. We came here bright and early when it opened. Everyone who works at the aquarium seems so happy, friendly, good hearted. I love the exhibits... the otters, jelly fishes, open sea, kelp forest, tentacles, penguins. We spent five hours at the aquarium during our visit. Last year I did 3 hours and realized that wasn't enough time to see everything. Maybe go 3 hours and then get lunch and do another 2 hours. I can stay here all day. Also make sure to watch the movie screenings too. You learn so much and the speakers are funny and knowledgeable. There is so much to see, but I think one part of the exhibit that gets overlooked and you don't have as much time to see b/c you leave it till the very last are the sharks, tentacles, and the new BAJA exhibit. The baja exhibit has seahorses!"
888,2018-12-28,5,"Just didn't all day there with many thousands of people and had only positive experiences. The staff and volunteers were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The restaurant food was delicious and interesting. And the exhibits are phenomenal. Hadn't been in many years and it's only gotten better and better. Recommend one if the guided tours that take you behind the scenes. Looking forward to taking my grandkids as it's super kid friendly. The octopuses, otters, jellies, penguins, kelp, sardines....all amazing!"
889,2016-02-05,5,"I love this aquarium!While many aquariums I have been tend to focus more on entertain-and-impress, Monterey Bay Aquarium focuses more on inform-and-educate. Sure, this aquarium still has many impressive displays such as the two-story tall Kelp Forest and the Olympic-pool-sized Open Sea, but everything in this aquarium is all about the aquatic ecosystems in Monterey Bay to give you an idea of the different universe under the blue water immediately outside. Plus, the scheduled and the unscheduled feeding shows that happen throughout the aquarium give awesome lectures on facts of these wonderful sea creatures.Because of this aquarium's popularity, expect this place to be crowded even on the weekday so come early, but even so, the aquarium layout makes the crowd much less overwhelming. Be sure to sign-up the aquarium text alerts for unscheduled feedings to make the most out of this trip, but whatever you do, you cannot miss the Open Sea feeding show, which the trainers give various feeds to vitalize different fish schools into some kind of dazzling dance! If you find your legs tired of walking, sit in the regularly-playing 15-minute movie presentations to learn more about the Monterey Bay sea life or the aquarium conservation efforts.Whether you come as a family, a friend group, or solo, you will definitely have a good time in Monterey Bay Aquarium!---MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THIS TRIP1) Come early so the crowd won't be too overwhelming2) Sign-up for the text alert for unscheduled feeding show3) Plan to go to the Open Sea feeding show4) Take a break from walking with a short movie presentation5) Go outside the lunch as the cafeteria is overpriced and overcrowded"
890,2016-05-16,4,"Everything has pretty much stayed the same since those elementary days aka the fields trips! Which has been over 10 years for me, lol! Majority of the workers are so nice and sweet, since this is run by non-profit, everyone here are volunteers I believe. Our latest visit, one of the employees really helped us out for my boyfriend's sea otter paper. Big shoutout to her for being freaken awesome and helpful (:They also added 3 other exhibits like the one for desert animals and fishes called Viva Baja, the Tentacles for Octopuses, Cuttlefish and Squids and Mission to the Deep where you get to see the marine life that are deep within the ocean. Really unique new exhibits that they offered beginning this month.Always kept clean and things have barely changed! If you want to return to the exhibit to run and get something or venture out for a bit, grab a stamp by the exits. Priced are quite steep now, getting a pass is worth it for families or else a ticket for once a year is fine for that splurge. I love taking a stroll down that pier and looking in at all the giftshops that have been there for year, such a quiet and nice town. Just some major traffic when you start heading downtown and closer to the freeway though. Its ridiculous like 101 -____-"
891,2016-03-10,4,"I think a lot of people feel like once they've been to one aquarium, it's the same all over the world. Well, I use to feel like that too but then I realized that each individual aquarium has their own uniqueness of what makes them special to their community and what they specialize in to help this world.When I came to this aquarium, I had no expectations of finding anything interesting, but it was genuinely the group of people I was with that made me more excited to find out what made this aquarium unique and I found it in the cutest otters ever in the 2nd floor! The aquarium fee is about $40 per person but we felt the entire experience was worth it as we spent more than 5+ hours there just walking up and down and around the whole entire aquarium and the best part is that we didn't feel rushed to have to finish seeing everything. We even caught the education show they had there which showed how the aquarium came to be and why it was formed. Awesome way to spend a free day while you're up in Monterey!"
892,2016-05-10,5,"The Monterey Bay aquarium brought out a childlike sense of wonder! This place is the largest aquarium I've seen, and there are plenty of fascinating exhibits to visit. It's huge so you can spend hours exploring the aquarium! The entrance fee was a little pricey but worth it.My favorite spots were the jellyfish as well as the open sea exhibit. My boyfriend and I arrived just in time to see their feeding time presentation where we watched giant tuna and sharks chow down. This is a multimillion dollar exhibit and the largest one in the aquarium so definitely check it out! I also enjoyed watching the cute penguins and sea otters. I suggest that you show up early to the shows to get a better view up front because they fill up fast! Some exhibits are small so you end up way in the back where it's hard to see if you don't go early."
893,2018-12-24,4,"A nice little aquarium for the bay area. We enjoyed our visit there. We have also seen the aquariums in Vancouver, Chicago and Boston. All of those were much bigger and had a lot more animals to see."
894,2016-01-02,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium deserves its top spot as the most visited attraction in Monterey. The marine life is well-cared for and facilities are well-maintained. Both staff and volunteers are pleasant and helpful; no matter how busy it gets, they always make an effort to make each visitor's stay a memorable one. It gets over 12k visitors on a busy day, so come early and prepared. If you can, try visiting on a weekday for a less harried experience. However, for a truly one of a kind experience, schedule an overnight stay during one of the aquarium's sleepover events. Our family spent our New Year's Eve sleeping over at the aquarium and ringing in the new year with a view of hammerhead sharks, dolphin fish and green sea turtles! We woke up and headed to the viewing deck to watch the sunrise with sea otters and seals in the horizon. Priceless!"
895,2017-08-21,5,I loved it! Also try and see the shows they have.  Everyone loves their job and knows a lot about the fish and other sea life.
896,2019-01-20,4,Nice aquarium. Was smaller than I expected however great that it was geared toward kids.
897,2017-04-20,5,"I remember coming here as a kid, and finding it completely amazing. As a parent of a young child, it's even better now.  My son loves it because he finds the interactive display fascinating, and he loves the tide pool exhibit where the waves crash over your head. I think he could sit there for an hour and be happy.As a family, we all love to watch the jellyfish, which are pure tranquility.  He's coming around to enjoy the sharks and deep sea area now.  He's also thoroughly entertained by the sea otters as well.  The mix of animals and interactive areas that allow him to make squid swim, help collect trash from tidepool areas in a video game, or watch the displays to learn about ocean acidification are some of his personal favorites.I still adore the kelp forest, and watching him experience the aquarium just a bit differently each time.  We're season pass holders now, and the season pass pays for itself if you're a family going more then 2 times.  One of their big upgrades is the food.  Cindy Pawlcyn worked with them to improve the food here, and it's local, sustainable, and some of it is really good. I'm very partial to the soup and salad bar, which is always innovative and flavorful.  It's a good day for the family to explore, and maybe learn something to boot."
898,2016-06-26,5,"I hadn't been here for 30 years, but it's always been one of those places that I was desperate to take my son.  Finally, I was able to do it.  It was so truly awesome and with its well thought out exhibits that I was as taken in as he was.Just really and truly fantastic."
899,2014-01-23,5,"Ok so some people may complain about the price but this place is WORTH EVERY PENNY! I have always loved the aquarium and their various exhibits. I have been fortunate enough to go when they had the sea horse exhibit and the penguin exhibit. I took the little girls I nanny there on Sunday and we tore it up! Every staff person and volunteer we came in contact with was nice, friendly, and tremendously knowledgeable regarding the exhibit they were working. This made it a really great experience, especially at the ""hands-on"" exhibits. We brought our own lunch which helped with the cost as I am sure it would have hit the wallet a lot harder had we eaten there. However, it is fantastic that they do have a few food places as well as a few gift shops. Along with having spectacular exhibits, they have lot of interactive material for everyone, even the adults were playing with the ""kids"" toys. I would HIGHLY recommend going if you have not done so before. It is an amazing experience and certainly something you will never forget. If I could go every day you bet I would!"
900,2018-07-04,3,"My boyfriend and I were in Monterey for the weekend and were excited to go to the aquarium here because he heard it was suppose to be one of the better ones. For both of us, the total price of the tickets equaled $90 something  it took us about 2 hours to go through it. It wasn't anything wow or better than any other aquariums. It is VERY kid friendly and a lot of areas were dedicated to kid activities). The only decent exhibit is the jellyfish and octopus ones. Definitely not worth the money since it felt more geared towards children (good for families with kids of course), but not for single couples."
901,2018-05-24,5,"Great museum if you're into wildlife! Very pricey though, so hopefully you can find a good deal! All the workers were very informative and helpful. I never received any attitude from them when I needed help with directions and trying to find certain animals. I'll definitely come back one or twice a year!"
902,2018-07-19,5,Love this place is killer. Cant wait to go back and see the great white shark swimming along the beach.
903,2014-04-15,5,"I've been a fan of Monterey Bay Aquarium for many years.  Each and every time I visit, I learn something new and am amazed at some of the exhibits.  The jellies have always been amazing to me and I still am mesmerized by their UFO-looking illuminations.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Seahorse exhibit in my previous visit.  It has since been replaced by the Tentacles exhibit.  Regardless of the spot light, I enjoy the entire exhibit very much.The only downside can be the crowds on the weekends.  But it's tolerable and worth all the hassle.  I feel very fortunate to have such an amazing aquarium in northern California.  If you haven't been, you are really missing out.  If you have been but not lately, go check out the latest exhibits.  You'll be glad you did."
904,2017-08-12,5,We love this place so much we go like once or twice a year! It is undoubtedly one of the best aquariums in the country  because you are in the creatures backyard! Walk outside to the patios and experience the sea breeze of the Pacific. The animals inside are exactly how you see them in Finding Dory the Pixar Movie. Expect to be entertained for a couple of hours as you interact and learn about our ocean here on the West Coast. Parking can sometimes be a bit of a hassle if you want close proximity to the Cannery Row.
905,2018-12-30,1,"I do love this place, but last time I was here I bought a shirt and I was charged $5 more for a large then for a regular shirt. I'm sorry, but there is not $5 more worth of material in my shirt. Apparently they just want to charge me a height tax. I guess now we are discriminating on height. That's enough of my rant. If you are here your first stop should be either the kelp forest or the deep sea tank. They are on opposite ends so I would start at one tank and work my way across the aquarium to the other. Build in some time to stop and gaze at the tanks, especially the deep sea tank. It's almost meditative to sit and watch the big fish in this tank. The otters are very cute to watch, but it can be very crowded at their tank."
906,2014-01-31,3,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium isn't actually all that large.  I watched two shows in the auditorium, peeked around many heads at the otter feeding, and had made my way through every exhibit in about 2.5 hours.At $39.95 for an adult, this is not a cheap day out, but I did enjoy myself.  My favorites were the Jelly Experience filled with a variety of jelly fish, and the octopus, once he got moving.Sure there were class trips going on as well as a bounty of families with younger children, but still it wasn't overly crowded on a Monday.  But when it got to otter feeding time - look out!  Get there early or be prepared to not see all that much.Be sure to stamp your hand before you head out the door if you might be continuing your visit later on the same day.  Or if you just want to check out the sea creature stamp of the day under the blue light.Restrooms are scattered about - a key to being a family friendly destination.There wasn't a parking lot on site, but I managed to find free street parking by the beach less than 10 minutes walk away.  And on the way back to the car, I noticed some wild seals languidly lounging on the shady beach - they're the dark looking boulders that I had initially overlooked.PS - Don't get overly caught up by the nice scenery outside while you're making your way down the steps to the Jelly Experience... or you might end up trip-falling down a short flight of stairs.  Fortunately, I managed to get my balance back just in time so I didn't leave a Vivian-shaped impression on their floor.  Hugely embarrassed, but saved from an out of state visit to the ER!"
907,2018-04-09,2,The food the that that is offered in the food court is pretty good. I would say it is typical for for the venue. The biggest reason I am not offering higher marks is due to people I witnessed working food service not using best practices. Like cleaning nails and teeth them working with silverware for customers. Also reaching under aprons to do something??? But not exchanging gloves for fresh ones.
908,2018-07-15,5,"Came into town for the weekend and this place was on top of my list for things to do. Just fish and the sea are one of my favorite hobbies so you already know the amount of excitement I was feeling. Every exhibit doesn't disappoint. It was a tad busy today so if you're not there quick enough you really can't see the feedings of some of the attractions(otters, penguins, etc.) Great place for your kids too. Food here is typical nothing compared to Disneyland but if you aren't prepared might as well grab something to eat while you spend hours gazing and looking at your favorite water animals haha."
909,2016-01-23,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is the premier Aquarium here in California. Others may be larger in size or feature larger fish but MBA has the history and holds a special place in all Californians' hearts. Located in Cannery Row where Steinbeck use to venture through, MBA sits overlooking the bay giving you not only an amazing experience walking through the aquarium but also a breathtaking view of the environment around it.So the MBA really tries hard to feature the best of the wildlife that exist around the bay area. They have beautiful kelp forest exhibits showing off all sorts of plants and fish. They have a child's play area so that you can occupy the young ones with ADHD. You have a look out with a looking glass that allows you to see the otters playing the bay. Heck, you don't even need the otter exhibit (which they do have by the way) because of all the ones you see playing by the kayakers. There are two things that I remember best about MBA: one was the opening of the jellyfish exhibit. Still the largest collection of jellyfish around, MBA takes the cake on this one. The other equally amazing exhibit is their deep ocean exhibit which once housed a Great White Shark that they caught off the coast. They also have giant blue fin tuna which you don't get to see very often and other large sharks and rays. MBA is the institution that works on marine biology in the area. They were closely with the Stanford Marine Hopkins Station which is right down the road where most of the world's tuna migration studies are done. I have now seen many aquariums in the world but his one is my childhood love that will forever hold a special place in my heart."
910,2017-05-06,3,My husband and I enjoyed the aquarium but the size of the crowd on a Saturday was overwhelming. I would not recommend going on a weekend. The exhibits were nice but it's quite small compared to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. We enjoyed watching the films they played in the auditorium that were narrated by a volunteer or staff member.
911,2018-04-10,3,"The last time we came to the Monterey Bay Aquarium the entry fee was $25; now it's $50.  We also opted to park in a nearby garage for $15. So, we watched every documentary in their theater; attended every live feeding and touchy-feely rays and starfish pools. We also learned the aquatic life at the aquarium dine on human quality seafood. One of the lecturers even mentioned, ""the fish at the aquarium are fed salmon that I cannot afford to eat"". This is probably why the entry fee is so high for such a smallish aquarium. Ref: Steinhart Aquarium, SF. $39"
912,2018-07-25,4,My kids absolutely love it here.  To beat the crowds go during the week.
913,2016-11-21,5,"My 6 year old and myself had a very nice day. The shows in the auditorium are very informative and entertaining. We saw the albatross and it was amazing. The aquarium is really good at educating and making awareness of keeping the earth clean and sustainable. On our way out, my daughter stopped at this desk next to the information booth, that too was very educational, when we were listening to the presentation a boy came to the table who obviously had autism, we were not bothered in any way whatsoever, and I was really impressed as to how the man giving his presentation was very patient and understanding to the boy. It really spoke of the quality of employees working at the aquarium. He really did an awesome job."
914,2017-09-06,5,This is the best aquarium I've ever visited. I always enjoy visiting as they are always making improvements. I do like the  themes but could use more species in the sea horses.A tip if you're pressed for time- do not go on the weekends if it can be avoided. You'll enjoy it more when the place is not crowded.
915,2018-02-26,5,"So much fun! It had been years since I've at the aquarium- brought some youngsters from Canada- and they were enthralled. Of course, everybody hovers around the otters. It was during December and Christmas vacation so the place is packed. Parking can be a pain in the neck. We ate before we arrived- a brilliant idea. You have to do it once."
916,2018-12-25,5,Love this place. Only downfall is when it is full of kids. I try my best to go during the week. I was a member a year ago but let it lapse only due to my time constraints.
917,2017-03-07,5,".. love, animals!!! So much fun, coming here. Seeing what the animals are doing and etc. also, you can't beat the views!!! Hehe. I'm a sucker for views and animals... I'm coming here, again.. for my son's field trip. Towards the end of the month.. can't wait to see the kids faces.."
918,2014-09-14,5,"Love this aquarium! There's plenty to see and it's very interactive. Enjoyable for both kids and adults - you could easily spend 3-4 hours here.I enjoyed seeing and learning about the various creatures, i.e. jellyfish, seahorses, and sharks. The penguins were probably my favorite! It's a little pricey - about $40 for admission, but I think it's worth it, especially if you're not from the area. A must-see when touring Monterey!"
919,2018-02-04,4,"This aquarium has a large number of and diverse selection of sea creatures. I got to see kinds of creatures such as lobed comb jelly, sea gooseberry, and garden eel that I don't think I've seen before. We also got to watch the feeding of African penguins and sea otters. The more aquariums I visit, the more I realize that I'd prefer watching sea creatures in their natural habitat, but nonetheless, this aquarium provides a safe and very educational place for children and anyone who wants to learn more about sea creatures. Many staff are stationed in each area just in case you require more information or assistance. They also have presentations in the auditorium. The one we attended on sharks was highly entertaining and informative. You can spend 2-3 hours comfortably. There is no parking so find parking elsewhere. Lastly, the admission is super pricey at $50 US per adult."
920,2018-07-21,5,"Lots of things to do and see there! My 21 month old son enjoyed himself very much! The place where the smaller kids can play and ""feed"" the birds was his favorite! He could've stayed there all day. Such a great first aquarium experience for him! Thank you, Monterey Bay Aquarium!!!"
921,2017-07-26,5,Best aquarium I've been to in my life nestled in historic cannery row in Monterey. Plan on at least 4 to 5 hours to see everything and I'd recommend starting after noon as attendance is slower later in the day.
922,2015-10-05,4,"They have a sea turtle! Loved the Monterey Bay Aquarium! We all had a great time! There was plenty to see that's for sure. What I really like about this Aquarium is the location. Most of the sea creatures are in tanks surrounded by their completely natural habitat. I am so fascinated by the sea! I am usually the one reading the descriptions next to all of the tanks. I really learned a lot here! There were lots of interactive learning centers too! The aquarium is very clean. Parking is pretty easy to come by and it is free! I wouldn't say it's a 5 star trip because it is too expensive for what it is. It's over $100 for 3 people and that's with the college discount! Additionally, they don't offer maps of the place unless you pay extras for them. We should have bought them because we ended up missing a couple exhibits. This is definitely something I would recommend doing once. It is a great place to have your first aquarium experience but its not all that different from others like Long Beach or San Diego."
923,2015-12-03,5,"Wow, what an incredible experience. This aquarium is truly world class and several of the exhibits are absolutely jaw dropping. My top 3:1) The Open Sea exhibit is probably my favorite. The enormous scale is incredible. It's not just the scale of the tank, but also the size of the creatures in the tank and the way that they interact with each other. It really must be seen in person to be fully appreciated. I recommend taking a moment to sit in the upper observation area to fully appreciate the spectacle on display.2) Giant Pacific Octopus. If they are not moving when you arrive, it's definitely worth it to hang around and observe. Seeing one of these other-worldly creatures on the move is absolutely marvelous and captivating. These animals are so unlike anything that walks the earth, I found it a little unnerving to see them up close and in the flesh. 3) Jelly Fish exhibit. Each tank is like a live piece of performance art. The variety of jellies is really impressive, especially the bioluminescent ones.Overall, it's well worth the price of admission. Certainly a great experience for both kids and adults! Pro-tip: Dont be a goober and use flash photography around the aquariums. The photos will not turn out and it disturbs the animals!"
924,2017-11-12,5,"Absolutely love it. It's a genuine educational experience with any sort of marine wildlife and biology. Great for families and the sights of the otters , jellyfish, and more are breathtaking. If you're around the Monterey area, come by and go touch bat rays or some sea urchin."
925,2017-07-24,4,"I love the layout of the whole place. Maybe it was just me, but I felt like the best place was outside. Where the tide pool is located at, and where you can just gaze over the ocean and relax. Overall, great aquarium and fishes. Will definitely be back one day. It's a tourist attraction, so everything is pricey. I'd suggest packing your own lunch and drinks. And if you want a souvenir, look for the ones on sale. I was able to get a cute little magnet, that had been marked down twice, for about $3. Score!"
926,2018-05-31,5,What can you say....it's the best aquarium I have ever been to.  The volunteers are so helpful and friendly.  A little expensive for a family but worth it.
927,2017-03-31,5,"My 4yo is absolutely obsessed with the Aquarium! When it's not over crowded, it's a WONDERFUL place to visit. However, the price.... during the summer/busy tourist times I would NOT pay $50 per to get in. You'll spend your time being run into, shoved, dealing with screaming, & crazy kids running loose, while not being able to get close enough to actually see/touch anything. Also, with all those extra bodies it becomes incredibly hot & humid in the building. And the Splash Zone/touch pool areas? Forget about it! However, when it's not crowded... wonderful! There's a wide variety of sea life to see, not just the same five fish and some otters. Plus the touch pools, which are well manned with volunteers who know their ish, we're a bonus for our wee one. Be sure to see the Tentacles exhibit (bottom floor, underneath the Outer Bay exhibit) with the cuttlefish and nautilus. So, so cool! A membership is totally worth it if you're doing repeat visits, and pays for itself in two visits (two adults 1 child). PS - if you insist on taking your cameras, for the love of all that is holy, TURN OFF YOUR FLASH!! As fun as it was to be repeatedly blinded by flash photography in a dark exhibit that was COVERED in ""no flash photography"" signs, I'd prefer to see fish, not spots, at the Aquarium."
928,2016-01-02,5,"It's been years since I have went to the aquarium here! I was so excited when my aunt asked me to come along with my cousins (ages 7&8)!Parking was a struggle and I would suggest bringing along a lot of quarters for the meters in the area. My aunt parked a few blocks away and parked at a 10 hr meter. The aquarium is a great place for children and adults to learn and explore! I'm 23 and I'm pretty sure I had a lot more fun than my baby cousins. Haha. It's super clean which is great, and the exhibits are awesome! My favorites were the Penguins, sea otters and the jellies!!!! I swear I could stay in that room forever. It's totally awesome for families, dates or educational experiences! I'll probably come back again and for Cannery Row."
929,2014-07-13,4,"My husband and I went to this aquarium during 4th of July weekend (on July 5th to be exact) and we're so glad we bought tickets online beforehand! Tip: buy your tickets online and do ""will call"" for pick-up. This method is so much faster because there was a line out the door to buy tickets to the aquarium when we arrived, and it's super busy on weekends.Because I picked up my tickets at ""will call"", I barely waited in line and got my tickets immediately to enter the premises. This was my 2nd time at the aquarium and my husband's first time, so it was fun for both of us. We enjoyed the open sea + jellies exhibit the most since there were so many fascinating creatures and ""open sea feeding shows"" to watch. Hooray!Although I thought the price was pretty high, but hey - it's not often that we come to this aquarium so why not? :) So many families came here with their kids since the entire place is kid-friendly and educational too.It's cool they have ""touching"" areas where you can touch the sea animals."
930,2018-03-16,5,Great and fun place! We have got the Ocean Advocate membership! Highly recommend!! Save money and walk! Part a little further down Ocean Ave!! You also get the view of the ocean! Free parking!!
931,2013-11-17,4,"""I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy"" -- Dory said it the best! My absolute favorite exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium was The Jellies Experience. And it quite an experience indeed, with two floors of gorgeous jellyfish, big and small. My favorite one is the Egg Yolk Jellyfish, which looked like egg drop soup. The decorations, signs, and lighting in this exhibit was almost like a time machine taking you back to the 1970s. It was a very psychedelic vibe compared to the more modern displays of the aquarium. Other fun exhibits:+ Kelp Forest: didn't know some kelp could grow over 10 inches PER DAY+ Sea Otters: definitely amusing to watch them swim around and play with each other. They are so fluffy!+ Deep Sea: I was so amazed to see tuna up close (they are huge!). Keep an eye out for my favorite awkward sea fish, the Ocean Sunfish. + Shark Presentation: loved all the shark trivia before the presentation. Staff seems very knowledgeable and passionate about their work and that is reflected in their presentation. Fun fact -- no one has ever seen/recorded great white sharks mating or giving birth. Things to note:- Don't pay for parking EVER! Just go up the hills past Nob Hill / 7-11 and there is residential street parking. It still takes you less than 10 minutes to walk back down to the aquarium. - Order tix online and print them out to avoid a line the day of your visit. Or pick them up at Will Call- Utilize your student ID and get a discount rate ($31.95)I spent about 3 hours here and felt like I saw everything thoroughly. Yes, it is pricey but it's worth it to visit at least once, especially if you're in the area. You can easily spend half a day here then take a walk out on Cannery Row or drive down to Carmel for the beaches.The Tentacle Exhibit with octopuses will open up April 2014."
932,2018-06-09,5,We love this aquarium. Our kids have a great time here. There is much to do for everyone.  I have been to many aquariums including one of the nicest in Chicago and this one is in the top 10 for sure. :)
933,2013-09-28,5,"Exactly one week ago, I took my kids here to kickoff my little one's birthday celebration. Since I am not having a party for him, I figured this is the best place to go. It's a win-win when they can have fun and learn at the same time. Unfortunately my little one was too excited to soak in the things I was teaching him. Like my former direct supervisor said, ""He is not even 2 - give him a break."" Well! We came early, like right when they open so that we can see some of the exhibits before it gets too crowded. What a smart idea but some folks had the same thought and went early. It was pretty packed at 10. We were able to watch the sea otter feeding w/o any obstructions. I like this exhibit the most, OK, my 2nd best because I adore sea otters. In captivity, they are fed clams and other shellfish w/o the shell to prevent the glass (windows) from breaking. We walked everywhere. My daughter was my tour guide. I had her look at the map and tell me which exhibit is where and so forth. It's frustrating when I come across people that do not understand a map; I do not want my daughter to fall under that category. She did awesome!The jellyfish cave is another favorite of mine. It was dark and crowded. My little one was running from one display to another, curious I am sure. I didn't have a chance to read the plaques per display because I wanted to keep my eyes on them. I used to have a salt water tank and had box jellyfishes. Those things still amaze me. How can something be so delicate and fragile be a predator and sometimes deadly? Freakin' awesome. What my kids like most are the tide pools area, where they can actually touch or handle the different sea creatures. I touched a sea cucumber per my daughter's request and screamed. Yup, the guys manning that section all laughed at me. The cute hermit crabs were handled by both kids. My little one had a blast. There is a section where kids can play and enjoy some water fun. This is where parents can usually sit or stand for a brief moment... my son was furious when we left this area. I am a parent that cannot stand the crying and tantrums. W/in less than a minute, he stopped. It boggles my mind when I see parents do nothing when their kids run amuck or cry like they're hurt.. ""You're the parent, control your goddamn kids!""My favorites: sea otter exhibit, jellyfish cave, tide pools handling exhibit, stingrays exhibit, and of course the penguin exhibit which BTW is my favorite animal in the universe. I love penguins! I am 50% sure that you can adopt a penguin; not to take home w/ you sadly but to help fund the organization and to keep such programs alive. I will look into it the next time I go.The price is steep but well worth it. If you are an early bird like myself, you can score free parking by the park and beach."
934,2019-01-04,4,"Beautiful. Love the locals nights and evenings by the Bay. Both start at 6pm. Delish food, wine and music. Lower prices. Smaller crowds. A must for locals."
935,2016-04-02,4,"This aquarium is really cool. Everyone I've ever talked has always told me to go and thankfully through my school (CSUMB) gives me a free pass to go once a year. It was really pretty. I went on a Friday and there was a lot of people, but not over crowded or anything. I was really happy with the cleanliness of the building. There was no smudges on the glass and the floor was kept clean as well. There was a lot of interactive things to do as well such as touching the kelp, sting rays, and talking with a worker and touching other under water plants/animals. There are a few gifts shops inside with a lot of cute items for friends and family. They even have a huge cafeteria to eat while inside. I enjoyed my time at the aquarium a lot and can't wait to come back again."
936,2016-01-02,3,"It's famous, but overrated and overpriced. Very typical aquarium, nothing really extraordinary. It's small, tedious to find a parking. Jelly fish collections were very inspiring."
937,2016-04-12,5,"Absolutely my favorite aquarium of all time.  We drove to Monterey from South Lake Tahoe just so I could share the greatness that is Monterey Bay Aquarium with our three year old daughter.  It is amazing that they can make it an aquarium and yet doesn't make you feel like you are exploiting the animals and marine life that are housed there.  It is educational, environmental, fun and has great history and architecture.  My three year olds favorite exhibit was the sea otters and their feeding time.  The sea otters were on display, but were also explained as otters that were not releasable due to health ailments.  Therefore they hold this gals and use them to help nurse and rehabilitate other sea otter pups that may get into trouble and need a little help before being released. I loved the section that offered a little history of cannery row and how the area came to be what it is today.  An absolute must on the PCH."
938,2015-10-05,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is absolutely magical. I had the luck of being raised in a family that appreciated animals of all kinds, and so several times a year, we would make the drive down to the aquarium so I could stare at the penguins, make squeaking sounds to the otters, and marvel at the massive kelp forest. I may not make it down that enough, but every year I renew my membership, and head down for a fantastic weekend. There are some fun gala events every year as well, which are well worth checking out."
939,2018-06-19,5,This aquarium is great! It is super cool to see all the cool animals and I loved it! I went with my bf and we really enjoyed it! It is very pricy but it is worth the cost!
940,2015-09-08,5,"This is one of the nicest aquariums we've ever been to. If you're ever in Monterey, this is one stop you and your family should make. This aquarium is simply amazing. Getting here early probably wasn't the best plan when coming here. The lines were out the door and around the building. But once inside, everything was smooth sailing! All of the exhibits were so beautiful! The Monterey Bay Habitats, Kelp Forest, Open Sea, Sea Otters, and Splash Zone exhibits were just some of our favorites!We liked seeing the Leopard Shark (well, all the sharks for that matter), wolf-eel (with ""the face only a mother could love""), and those adorable sea otters and puffins playing. The Jellyfish exhibit was great too. The best way to end our visit here was by sitting on the deck at the Great Tide Pool outside. It was a lovely spot to enjoy those wonderful views of Monterey Bay. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is so much fun! There's something wonderful here for both children and adults alike. To learn a bit about the area's history and see those beautiful exhibits and local habitats, this is great stop when visiting Monterey!"
941,2017-07-16,5,"I would like to take one star back for the CROWDS of people, but it's not the aquarium's fault that it's so awesome we ALL want to see it.  Best aquarium I have ever enjoyed.  This was my 5th or 6th trip.Five stars for quality of entertainment and effort in giving back to our world.If you do not have children with you and you walk pretty fast, you can cover the whole place in about 3 hours.  But take your time!  You may want 30 minutes or more to sit and watch the otters or the Open Sea exhibit.Plan your visit!  Get here EARLY because the crowds just get thicker as the day grows long.  Check the map they give you when you arrive and make note of the location of any exhibits you MUST see or the times of any feedings you want to attend (or AVOID, if like me you hate the crowds).Some of the most interesting exhibits are in the smaller tanks, so don't just focus on the big ones!Several gift shops are scattered on the property and they all carry different items and most of them have ""Sales"" racks, so shop around before getting your souvenirs.Also, skip the cafeteria food.  There are about a billion places within a 4-block radius of the aquarium that serve better food.  (I always choose Sea Harvest Fish Market for lunch.) My advice: Arrive early, go out to eat lunch, then return to finish touring the aquarium.Be sure to step out those back doors and enjoy the views!"
942,2015-11-22,5,"always wanted to visit here since I was a kid, my class never visited for a field trip others classes did smh, so I was super juiced to see some sharks etc. my kids were super excited too we had a wonderful time, kinda disappointed they didn't have a great white shark but a hammerhead will doits a wonderful place to take your family the area where they have the jellyfish was awesome, we also saw a show about great whites that was educational and saw the penguins feeding which was cool, plus afterwards we hung out on the pier enjoying Montereys beautiful weather, I can see myself bringing the family back here at least once a year"
943,2015-12-16,5,"I took my boyfriend on a surprise birthday adventure this past summer to Monterey, so of course our main destination was the aquarium! We live about 2 hours away in the East Bay Area and have been coming to the aquarium with family and friends every few years.This is by far the best aquarium we have been to and are never disappointed when we visit. There are so many exhibits, informative presentations and opportunities for hands-on interaction. The kelp forest and deep sea are my favorite areas.I love coming to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and always spend hours admiring and learning about the wonderful creatures. My boyfriend enjoyed it just as much and it was the highlight of our day! We will definitely be back sometime soon."
944,2013-11-06,5,"There's a reason they show commercials for this aquarium all over the country - it's a very special place!  Whether you just love museums or are truly enchanted by the sea, this place will bring out the kid in you, the scientist in you, and will remind you how much wonder and beauty there is in this world.  No experience here is ever the same, you'll see new things each time!  Sometimes the eels are poking their heads out of their caves, sometimes the giant octopus is on the move, sometimes the sea otters' antics just cannot be contained!  I was also treated, I suppose, to penguin mating season this year when I visited in late September!  And if you're a geek like me, wandering the halls and walking past the kelp forest will bring back smiling memories of the Enterprise crew's visit to San Francisco in 'Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'!  My favorite area is called the Deep Sea.  The entrance alone is astonishing, almost zen-like.  The open tank here is nothing short of incredible - if you ever had daydreams of being a mermaid, this is your happy place.  The best photo op in the whole place is of course the Sea Nettles - make sure you find them and get that shot!  Walking distance from many hotels in Monterey and otherwise parking is nearby at a reasonable cost.  Plan to devote at least 4 hours to your exploration of all levels of the aquarium, especially on a Saturday.  They've also newly renovated and improved their cafeteria, which is spacious and has tons of decent options, plus a fine dining restaurant tucked away from the mayhem - I bet that is worth a return visit!If you are in the area, this is THE must-stop attraction - come explore!"
945,2016-03-02,5,Well i was there today and it was an insane mad house of way to many kids to many kids means to much noise evev with the earlpugs i couldn't handle the noise and of course the kids are getting in the way when one is taking picture or video. I will never have kids no way i also notice when i'm out in public parents don't always have an eye on the kid or control like they should in a public place. Way to many kids here today!!!!! Which is why i left when i did to keep my sanity intacted. Was way to much for me.They keep this place very very clean.
946,2015-12-29,3,"I know I'm not in the majority on this.... but I'm here now. Waaay to many people and the displays and such are small so you got about 100 ppl per square ft  in one hot, musty, dark, dreary, stanky area. I'm not kidding it smells like fart in all the inclosed areas. Tons of small kids and older people so don't expect to move freely. I do love all the ways that they support marine wildlife, and appreciate all they do. I came on a Tuesday,  and it was packed. So idk when it's not crowded. Don't even get me started on the parking situation. It's not a very large place but theu do offer many shows and feedings, as well as audio tour. I spent about an hour in here then I had to be on my way. Surrounding area is beautiful outside of the aquarium."
947,2015-10-13,5,"Aquariums never fail to amaze me!It was about $40 for general admission but we used out student ID's to get about 5 bucks off! I know it's a bit pricy but it's worth it!They have one of the largest tanks in the world, I seriously could not stop staring at it. It had huge turtles, 500lb tuna, and hammerhead sharks swimming around in it. Not to mention the thousands of anchovies swimming around at the bottom!!They also have a great kelp tank. It's a 3 paneled tank, one of the first tanks you see when you walk in. Very beautiful.The jellyfish exhibit was also awe-mazing. Especially loved the egg yolk jellyfish LOL.And right when you walk outside, you get an amazing view of the ocean. Go up a few floors and bam! an even more amazing view. I loved how the aquarium is located on Cannary row, so after we were done, we took a walk all the way down. It led us to some cute shops, delicious candy, and relaxing beaches!Great place for a day-cation!"
948,2018-12-15,5,This is the best place to bring your kids or grandkids if they want to see and get up close to any marina life. And that they will do over night trips for the kids is even better!! When our families come Friday m put of state this is the first place all the kids want to go!! I would recommend this place for everyone because it is fun for everyone!! And they have a section for just the little kids that is the best ever for them to play
949,2017-04-12,5,"I believe this is the best aquarium in California. My son had so much fun. We got to see them feed the fish, which was entertaining for adults and kids. Especially, their 100 lbs sea bass, since he ate his food whole. Sucked it up like a vacuum."
950,2015-11-30,5,"I've probably been to this aquarium more times than I can count on my hands, and it's spoiled me. There are very few aquariums in the country on this level and even fewer with such dedication to research and conservation.Let me rehash what I'm sure everybody else is saying: the jellyfish are way cool. There are so many different types, and the lighting in the tanks highlights their beauty perfectly. The enormous, wall-to-wall glass exhibits are incredible, and it's so cool to see so many fish, sharks, rays, corals, etc. all coexisting so well. I love watching the packs of sardines swim over me. But there are a couple of exhibits that consistently use a little work, and those are the ones that aren't inhabited by marine-only animals like penguins and otters. Those ""tanks"" are much harder to keep clean and sometimes it shows.The kids' tours are fantastic. I am so impressed with how amiable the young tour guides are. They are incredible with the kids and know how to make the experience both educational AND fun. The touch exhibit is also a lot very enjoyable for all ages--I'm always game for touching stingrays and starfish.I'm sure by reading other reviews you're concerned about it being crowded. Yes, it can become uncomfortably packed inside, BUT there are also times when it's quieter and when you can have meditative experiences. The trick is coming as early as possible Monday through Thursday, preferably in the winter. There might be a class or two on a field trip, but the kids are generally on a short leash and won't ruin your experience.Also, admission is expensive. There's no way of getting around that, unless your company rented out the Aquarium for a private evening event (hello, Google!) but that fee is reflective of the research that the organization does in the Bay. Plus, like I said earlier, this is one of the top 2 or 3 aquariums in the U.S. If you have money to spend on educational adventures or touristy trips, I think the admission price is worth it."
951,2018-07-11,3,"With the online accolades and bragging done by everyone you meet when you mention the Monterey aquarium  I guess I just expected more. For a ticket price of $50 for an adult I definitely expected a lot more. I've been to many aquariums across the nation and this one doesn't really stand out over any other (besides the extra friendly staff) except for their over the top admission charge. It's definitely worth $29.99 but a $49.99 admission is just outrageous unless you have something in the aquarium that is not in any other. Touching rays, feeding otters, and endless fish in a tank are just as abundant in many other aquariums across the US"
952,2016-01-21,5,"This aquarium is awesome! (even for adults). Overall, I was really impressed with the amount of interactive activities that the aquarium offered. Tickets aren't cheap, but the aquarium definitely uses the money to upkeep their facilities and make sure that everyone (yes even adults) have a great experience. Adults: $40, Kids (3-12): $25, Student (13-17 & College): $35, Senior: $35.The aquarium features some amazing animals (the sea otters were my favorite!) and what makes this aquarium really unique is that they have creatures that you would never otherwise be able to see (jellyfish, anemone, sharks, bat rays, etc). One of my favorite exhibits was the deep sea animals (including sharks and turtles). These animals are kept in an enormous glass tank and are absolutely incredible to see!"
953,2017-02-09,5,"On Cannery Row of the Monterey waterfront the Bay Aquarium has more than what is inside to offer. Numerous restaurants, novelty stores and bay excursions (whale watching) attract as much attention as the aquarium itself..With a few hands-on exhibits, this is a great place for curious children. They may touch a living stingray, starfish, abalone and sea urchins. I'd recommend going on line to arrange a schedule that will allow them to witness the numerous feedings and other events offered at this beautiful aquarium..I am a fan of the Jellies, Cuttlefish, Kelp Forrest and the Open Sea Exhibits, which at time have Sunfish and Hammer-head Sharks. Nothing remains in captivity forever so call to enquire what is actually on exhibit before making the journey to Monterey..If you are partial to just the aquarium, they offer a theater with informational film, two restaurants and several gift shops. I hop you enjoy your visits as much as I have over many, many years."
954,2017-08-30,5,Awesome place! Spent all day there yesterday! It was even better then the last time we were there.
955,2015-08-21,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is the 6th largest aquarium in the world according to Touropia! I love aquariums and would much rather go to an aquarium than a zoo. Since I only live 6 hours away from the aquarium, I decided on paying a visit here because why not? I was lucky the person at the Air BnB I was staying at provided her membership card to those staying so the aquarium was technically free. Comparing the Monterey Aquarium to the Aquarium of the Pacific or Aquarium of the Bay, it is noticeably larger and also offers more exhibits. It was crowded but it wasn't too bad and everyone just looks for a little and then leaves. It was clean and the employees were educational and helpful. There are huge tanks everywhere with so many different types of fishes and lots of things to look at. I have a thing for jelly fishes; they are mesmerizing and beautiful, yet deadly. The Jellies Experience exhibit is like a little 70's dance party and it's so cute! It was my favorite exhibit out of the bunch that I saw. There are so many different types of jelly fishes it's ridiculous. Mission to the Deep and the Open Sea were wonderful exhibits as well.Overall, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is such a pleasant experience! I loved the large tanks and plethora exhibits to go through. You would be able to see the whole aquarium at a decent pace in about 2 and half hours."
956,2015-08-10,5,"Noelle's Yelp Notebook 2015Monterey Bay Aquarium opened in October 1984- my parents were members and we frequented the aquarium often. It's amazing to see how the aquarium has evolved over the past 31 years. Back in the day there was a huge water exhibit where you could reach in and ""touch"" the bat rays- being a little girl it was always difficult to reach the bat rays, sometimes I'd be lucky and my finger tips would touch one of these majestic creatures, oftentimes I would end up getting my dress splashed with the water. The current bay ray exhibit is smaller and divided now into to pools- not like the large one they had in years past. On the second floor there was a balcony (metal grate floor with a metal railing) where you could see the Monterey Bay Aquarium employees feed the sharks and other fishes in the open aquarium area, this balcony has since been blocked with a clear plastic barrier- meaning you can still see them feeding the sea creatures you just can't access the balcony any longer.The second floor has a great play area for babies, toddlers and the under 10 set! There is a large play structure complete with a fun slide, in this area you will also find sea creature costumes that the little ones can dress up in when playing in and around the large play structure. There is an enclosed area for babies and kids under a certain height requirement- this area is pretty cool as its set apart from the bigger kids play structure. They also have a water play area- one for the big kids and one for the little kids.There are many hands on exhibits where you can touch the sea life and gather more information from their friendly docents. A favorite area of mine is the Jelly fish - such a wonderful exhibit showcasing these fascinating sea creatures. My favorite area is where you can see the fish in the open aquarium and there is plenty of seating for the entire family to enjoy the sea life- you can sit or stand right next to the glass for a better view (my favorite area to sit is on the second level).There are two restaurants located in the aquarium:Cindy's Waterfront RestaurantReservations are highly recommended. We waited 30 minutes and scored a table with a great water view. Food is overpriced and somewhat mediocre but there aren't many delicious options on Cannery Row.CafeThe line is out the door and people are fighting for seating. The cafe is a cafeteria setting but with high prices. Shopping:There are two stores inside the aquarium- one geared for kids and the other for adults. Both stores are really amazing and the staff are uber friendly and helpful. If you're a member be sure to use your member discount.Membership definitely pays if you come here more than once with your family or friends. I'm glad we're members. It's important to keep places like the Monterey Bay Aquarium open to educate the greater public on the conservation of these beautiful sea creatures. I love the ocean and the Monterey area in general. This is one of my most favorite spots to visit with my little family of 3!Noelle's NotesBeautiful Aquarium Skip the restaurants insideConsider becoming a memberArrive early and get street parking"
957,2015-09-11,3,"Oh The Aquarium  - I went there with the highest hopes and lowest of expectations - both were met. I went there with my whole family (4 of us).The Good=========Is the aquarium cool? - Yes, veryIs the aquarium loved by children? - YesIs the surrounding area cool? - DefinitelyThe Bad=========Is it a little pricey? - YesThe Ugly=========Is it crowded? - Oh my, yes, yes, yes!Is it worth it? - Hmmm, yes but I won't be returning anytime soon. Pro Tip=========Buy your tickets ahead of time.Find something else to do if you are in Monterey for more than a day.Recommmend Los Lobos hiking."
958,2016-12-29,2,"Lame. Bye bye $50 dollars. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on gas and take trip up and down the coast. The exhibitions were made up of more video screens than actual live creatures. If I wanted to see fish on a screen, I would've rented it from Netflix. The Long Beach aquarium is way more extensive, better exhibitions, less people and more peaceful, oh not to mention less expensive. This might be a great place to take your kids, but I wouldn't even put them through the screams and crowds that prevents one from taking in what little bit this aquarium has to offer. Anyways, I don't think I'll be going to the aquarium as much in the future, I feel guilty enough without supporting the captivity of live creatures.Ps The aquarium was not doing anything to regulate flash photography and kids banging on the glass, my heart goes out to these creatures who have to bare the mindless acts of humans."
959,2015-08-15,5,"One of the better part of the trips, the Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can park in a parking structure for $18 or find 4 hour street parking if you can. (metered parking of course).The aquarium opens at 9.30am, but the line starts earlier. If you're a member of the Aquarium, your door opens at 9am :) You wait inside in the ""lobby"" and then wait for the rope to clear at 9.30am :)))You go to the right and you'll have the special exhibitions. You have the sea otters right there (: They have feedings 3-4 times a day and you can see them eat. It's a nice show, but tons and tons of crowding. Suggestion tho.. go to the Open Sea, far right, immediately. You'll love it. I'm not going to say anything else. The rest of the special exhibitions, incl. the jellyfishes are also there for you to see.On the left of the main entrance, you have the kelp forest, habitats, and the touch pools. You can touch some of the sting rays (: And wash your hands afterwards :PPenguins on the 2nd floor as well (:I'm not going to say anything else because you have to see it for yourself :DNow, you must come here if you ever go to Norcal and just enjoy yourself for 2.5+ hours. You also gotta get to viewings early so that you can find spaces to sit at and enjoy the views (: Look, enjoy, and learn!Hungry? Food is on the first floor.Tickets are about $40, but if you have AAA you can get it for cheaper by a couple dollars."
960,2017-05-11,5,"Best aquarium I've been to, didn't realize it was gonna be so expensive. $50 for adults. If you can get discount tickets do it. My Job is part of recreation connection and they have them there. I regret not ordering them before we came. My favorite part was the customer service. Every employee we came across was above expectations and really seemed to love their job. We accidentlu walked outside trying to find the special exhibits in the second building on the first floor. You must go to the second floor to get to the second building first floor"
961,2017-03-08,5,"This aquarium, when it was built was like none other. Now many aquariums have followed their lead. What is spectacular isn't the exotic unusual animals and fish, it is the setting they live in. Fed directly from the Pacific Ocean and two story tall window exhibits for all local marine life. It's main goal is to educate not entertain. There is something for all ages here and even their cafe has very good food with an ocean view. Plan to spend the day there as tickets are pricey. The money is well spent on the conservation of the Monterey Bay and this amazing aquarium. For the kids they often do night time camp outs there which is the best time to see many of the residents who hide during the day."
962,2015-09-27,5,"Although it was supposed to take only 2 hrs to get to Monterey from San Simeon, it took us almost 3 hrs to get there since it was traffic on Highway 1.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium was going to close at 6PM and it was almost 4P by the time we arrived in Monterey, so we still had plenty of time to explore the Aquarium.  Monterey Bay Aquarium has always been a favorite of mine, so I was excited for the L.O. to check it out herself.  The place has expanded since I was last there.  We also lucked out that it wasn't too crowded, so we were able to take our time checking out the exhibits without feeling rushed or irritated.  The sea otter exhibit is an oldie, but goodie and I love sea otters especially since they are native to the area.  I also enjoyed the Jelly experience.  I am glad that we were able to check out the aquarium and check it off the list of places to visit as a family."
963,2019-06-26,5,"beautiful​ place, it is quiet, peaceful​, and nice!"
964,2018-06-26,5,"Definition of world class aquarium. It's clearly EXTREMELY competitive to work here, as every single staff member I've spoken to has had intimate knowledge of both flora and fauna. I come back once a year, and every time I'm there there's a new exhibit or modernized feature. The aquarium is the epitome of high end. These guys keep with the times. 10,000 thumbs up!!!"
965,2017-09-15,4,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium but my only complaint is that their pricing is outrageous! 50 dollars for 1 adult?? Otherwise, this is a great clean aquarium. Their habitats are well maintained and clean and their animals appear well taken care of. I would recommend going early since the aquarium is so popular it can get quite crowded at times. My husband and I will continue to visit but not as often as we use to because the pricing is so high now."
966,2016-04-12,5,"What can you say that already hasn't been said?  This place is awesome.  It is set up so well, and every exhibit is very nice and informative.  The Jellies are beautiful.  The volunteers there are super helpful and insightful.  We loved it.  It's a great place for families, and I can't wait to take my granddaughter here someday when she's old enough to enjoy it."
967,2018-06-09,5,This place is world famous for a reason! When we moved here the first thing we did was get a membership and my children ask to go every week. Well worth the price of admission!
968,2017-11-04,5,"As the name suggests, the aquarium is beautifully situated in Monterey Bay, right on the boardwalks of Cannery Row.  We we're lucky enough to borrow some guest passes, otherwise it would have been very pricey for our family of 5, but still worth the visit.  Plan on spending about 5 hours and be sure to grab a schedule on your way in so you can enjoy the different informational animal feedings.  You can also get a stamp and take a lunch break and come back."
969,2015-10-15,5,"As you can see from my 20 photos I really enjoyed my time spent at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, located right next to the ocean in beautiful Monterey California.We visited the aquarium on a field trip for my sons fourth grade class. The staff/ volunteers at the aquarium made this trip awesome. They were friendly, knowledgeable, good with kids, and just overall fun to be around.We got to see all exhibits in about 4.5 hours (.5 hours for lunch) and really loved the feeding ""shows."" At the feelings a volunteer comes out on a microphone and speaks with the crowd as a staff feeds the animals/ marine life. We saw the Penguins, sea turtles and kelp forest (sharks, fish, etc.) feelings. Awesome!The facility was clean, well staffed, had good signage and was just down right beautiful with several observation areas and glass windows showing great views of the Monterey Bay.Recommend"
970,2015-12-27,4,"The aquarium is always the highlight of my trip to Monterey, a stroll through the jelly fish section has my deep sea imagination run through its course.A pro tip -- if you're staying at a nearby hotel, tell the front desk to get you the tickets and have them ready before you head out; will save you some time waiting in line at the aquarium.The cafeteria is nice and had a pleasant staff, so you won't go wrong if you plan your lunch there. Try their clam chowder, it's delicious!The feeding sessions tend to get crowded, try to get there a bit early. They have a number you can text and you will get a heads up when an impromptu feeding is about to start."
971,2018-04-03,4,"World Class Aquarium!!!  Pricey admission fee, but the two times that I've gone, were thankfully using guest passes from a friend who had a membership.  A membership to this aquarium would be a fabulous gift, by the way...  We went on a Monday, during Spring break...  We arrived by 10:30 and the aquarium was already bustling with lots of kids and their parents.  Before our visit, I researched the aquarium feeding schedules in order to better plan our arrival.  We got there just in time for the Open Sea feeding, which was narrated by a local aquarist.  It was a great way to begin our visit.  Initially we thought we'd only be on site for about 3 hours.  We left for lunch on Cannery Row and came back to almost close down the Aquarium at 5:30...they close at 6 p.m.  We sat through five 15-minute Auditorium programs, all excellently produced and informative.  Favorite exhibit was the jellyfish, of course.  These beautiful creatures mesmerize.  Of course the sea otters and penguins are adorable.  Go say hello to them too.  I wish I had thought to schedule in their feeding times...  We did enjoy watching an aquarist feed the fish in the huge Kelp Forest.  Looking forward to going back again...in a few years.  :)"
972,2015-07-30,5,"***************************** 1348 **************************   One of the nicest aquarium in the country, a MUST VISIT, not only for kids, but for elderly like myself. It teaches you how to love the ocean, living things, and Mother earth more.    Jelly Fish, the Penguins, the Stingray, The Sharks, and the outdoor exhibits are some of my favorites. When I was a little girl lived in Saigon, I never got the chance to see any of these. I've always dreamt of some day I got to see all these living things in real life.    See, dreams do come true! Now I come here as often as I can! Service is always great here, Plenty parking lots in this area and you can always stroll down on Cannery Row after your visit."
973,2018-05-25,5,Awesome! Great for kids of all ages and adults too! Restaurant is amazing as well. Good food and beautiful ocean view
974,2016-08-15,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is THE BEST aquarium I have been to.It IS expensive, but definitely worth it. But I was surprised at the children's admission prices-- I thought the aquarium would encourage young children to explore the wonders of the ocean... but not all parents are willing to pay so much. Some of the nearby Inns/Hotels offer deals and discounts if you buy tickets through them.We took my 4 year old son to visit the aquarium as his birthday gift, and he LOVED it! He had previously been to the Steinheart aquarium in SF. I wasn't sure if he could handle everything there is to see, since the MBA is an all day experience, but he made it. (Conked out immediately in the car lol) He was so excited to see the different kinds of sharks. And octopi, and everything! He also really enjoyed the interactive displays.My favorite was the 'tentacles' exhibit."
975,2017-08-15,5,"We are members and attend the summer, ""Evenings by the Bay."" We love it. The music is great, the ""little bites"" are interesting and often delicious and a great value when you buy 5 tix for $20. I especially love walking around the exhibits when so few people are around. The Jellies are always mesmerizing and I love the Baja exhibit. The Garden Eels are something to see. This is a must see for visitors. For resident, the membership is a great value if you visit a few times a year or have guest."
976,2016-01-06,5,"LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL STUNNING AQUARIUM! I am so excited that I had to type that statement in ALL CAPS. A true gem in California. There is something for everyone of all ages and it is such a treat that we get to explore/discover/learn more about our oceans and its creatures that live within it. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I only had 2 hours to explore the aquarium but I can definitely see how people could spend an entire day here. There is so much to see here from sea otters, penguins, Sharks, jelly fish, and so much more! The aquarium is split up into different exhibits depending on the region of the deep sea. There is a kid friendly zone, feedings (we watched the sea otter feeding! Cutest thing ever!), shows, the list is endless. Coming from Southern California, the Monterey Bay aquarium is significantly larger than the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Although it is a bit pricey, $40 for adults, it is definitely a must visit. Bring your kids if you have any, they would love it!"
977,2016-09-07,4,"I wish I had more time to walk around, because the experience was very fun.They differ from other aquariums in that: They discuss the animals during feeding events, which is cool, and feeding times are  spread throughout the day. They also have an outdoor viewing area with free telescopes. We got to see small craw daddies, a stork, and lots of small fish and seagulls. Apparently there are many seals during the winter. They have rotating exhibitions in a different building. They're very informative. If you have a young child, there are many displays that are perfect for young children.However, the map is difficult to use, which shouldn't be a problem unless you want to get into every nook and cranny, and the overall price is pretty high, which is probably because of the name. Parking is also a nightmare! Try having someone drop you off. Overall, definitely worth the experience."
978,2016-01-04,5,"I have been coming to this aquarium at least annually since I was a child, and to this day it is as magical as it was when I was young.  We have our typical routine - rotating exhibit (70's style Jellies, Tentacles, etc) on the lower level, jelliws and Depp Sea exhibit, lunch in the cafeteria, stop in at the sea otters, then on to the touch pools and to see ""our"" octopus downstairs.  Now that I have three kids, we spend a lot more time in the Splash Zone letting them explore and play the games.I imagine that if you went without kids you would spend much less time here, but seeing the wonder in my kids' faces as they discover some of the same things I loved as a kid (touching the sea cucumber and the decorator crab) makes me want to spend the whole day here.Holiday weekends are NUTS so if you hate crowds come during the off season at closing time."
979,2017-02-12,4,"Beautiful place, very well put together and a lot to see and learn here. Literally the only reason I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5 (which might seem silly to some) is because of the parts in the aquarium that have ""touching pools"" where kids and whomever can put there hands in the water and touch certain creatures and just mess with their home. This really bothered me, a lot. I walked by one and saw beautiful stingrays all in one corner of a pool away from people as kids splashed around. I felt so bad. I had to skip looking at the rest like that."
980,2015-09-12,3,"The good: Kelp Forest. Open Sea Tank. Jellyfish EVERYTHING. The ""meh"": Otter exhibit. Penguin exhibit. No sea lion exhibit?!!?It is clear that the staff at the aquarium are doing amazing research and rehabilitation right in their backyard; therefore, I'm not upset about the admission fee ($39). I'll believe that it is all going to the efforts to care for orphaned baby sea otters. I was sorely disappointed with their Sea Otter exhibit.  It felt TINY for FIVE otters and the crowd that wanted to take roughly 50 pictures while standing at the glass. You could comfortably fit a maximum of maybe 12 people in front of the windows. And the otters are so darn cute that people would stand there with Snapchat on rapid fire for way too long. I wanted to stay for the feeding, but realized I'd be watching the back of human heads rather than the otters. The penguin exhibits (while there were two) were also way too small. While you could catch a glimpse from far away, I was still not impressed. The PPG Aquarium at the Pittsburgh Zoo dominates the MBA's penguin exhibits. Monterey should take notes. If you pay a visit, keep your expectations low and go hang out with the jellyfish."
981,2017-03-24,5,"We absolutely love the Monterey Bay Aquarium and compare other aquariums to it.  Love how there are so many local species and the focus on conservation.  We've seen sea otters, sea lions, and even whales in the bay from the deck of the aquarium.  The aquarium staff and volunteers are wonderful and incredibly knowledgable.There are lots of places for small kids to play and explore.  The splash area on the upper level (near the penguins) can get quite crowded, especially around the times for the penguin feedings.Pro Tips:1. Try to get there right away in the morning. It's much quieter in the morning before lunch, especially at the touch pools.  2. Decide if you want to go to any presentations or feedings and plan your day around that. There is usually one feeding at the Open Sea exhibit, and that one is the best of all of them.3. Get your hand stamped and leave for lunch.  Pack a picnic in your car or walk a few blocks to avoid the overpriced cafeteria.  4. If you think you'll go twice in the same year, get a membership.  Two trips will pay for the membership and gets you a discount at the gift shop."
982,2018-11-20,3,"We have gone to Monterey aquarium four times now and usually have a great time. Today was rather busy as it is Thanksgiving week and MBA didn't seem up to the task in keeping the aquarium clean. One area smelled as if someone got sick and it wasn't cleaned up properly and downstairs in the Tentacles section it was also putrid, smelling of bad cheese and a stinky locker room. Other rooms were stuffy and stale. In confined area such as the enclosed exhibits, they should be well ventilated!!"
983,2017-08-08,5,Erin at the ticket counter was so patient & helpful! It was our first time here & it was such a very good experience. Everyone was so chill & laid back . We'll definitely visit again
984,2016-01-21,5,"What can I say? This aquarium is magnificent! The premises is enormous and there is so much to explore! I was a little taken aback at the ticket cost, but quickly realized it is totally worth it. This place really is incredible. I'm from San Diego and we have the Birch aquarium there, but this one absolutely dwarfs the Birch. This is a must-see if you're in Monterey!"
985,2015-09-28,5,"Each time I come here I feel like a little kid again. From seeing the Penguins swimming around to when they are fed, seeing all the different kinds of jellyfish. Even getting to touch some of the sea animals. And then getting to just step outside and take in the view of the bay! So beautiful!!! The price to get in is $39.95 for adults. Children from 3 - 12 years is $24.95. Students 13 - 17\college ID and Seniors are $34.95. I say it's worth it. You get to see a lot of sea animals and it's very educational too. There's different areas, upstairs and down. There's an area for kids too. They also have a cafe and sitting area with a view of the ocean. The cafe is pricy, but it's kinda given since it's inside the aquarium. That's also the area where you could go outside to see the ocean better and get some fresh air if you've been inside for a couple hours. Breath taking view!!!You could easily spend 3+ hours here just getting lost in watching a school of fish swim by or by entertained by the sea otters. Watching the penguins swim. There's even shows to watch like documentaries, sounds boring but it's really neat. Just if you can try NOT to come on the weekends. I know that might be hard to do. I went on a Saturday a week ago and it was Insane!! Too many kids, idk why their parents thought it was a place to let your kids run freely, but it was not cool. When your ""in line"" to touch a sea animal, a kid comes up and just stands right in front. Then your try saying something nice to them about not cutting and how there is a line and they just look @ you like your talking a different language! Some parents did get their child, but most of them just look @ you with a smile like ""Oh you'll let them cut cause they're a kid :]]]"" NO! I'm a nice person, but come on! Making me look like that bad guy here. So yeah if you don't want to get caught in that situation, trying to going on a weekday. Overall, I love this place. I learn something new everytime I come. This a definitely a place to see! :]]]"
986,2015-10-21,5,"For aquariums, it really doesn't get much better then the Monterey Bay Aquarium.Kids and adults alike will be amazed at all of the incredible sea life habitats the aquarium offers. What an educational and totally fun experience.Worth the price of admission - but plan to spend the whole day!  They have food (albeit so-so ""meh"" food and pricey, as expected) so you can plan an entire day excursion.  Great gift shops.  Make sure you get to see the sea otters... They are one of the best features (if you can catch them and if you can see them, because there's usually a huge crowd).So much to do, the kids will love it!"
987,2016-12-03,2,"I was quite disappointed in the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  It is quite expensive, considering they offer very little to their guests.  $50 per adult, and it simply is not worth it.  If you have small children, I guess it is ok, but I got through the entire aquarium in about an 1.5 hours.  It really is geared more toward very small children, but older children may get bored very quickly.   I love marine preservation, but the price will keep me from returning. In addition, what they did have plenty of were gift shops and places to get food.  They have a gift shop around virtually every corner, which is disappointing, as it takes away from the experience.     Too many gift shops and cafe's, and too expensive."
988,2016-05-24,5,"Awesome!! Great local sea life. Very well maintained, and fascinating. Could spend all day there, if it wasn't for all the loud kids, and people not paying attention while taking pics on their phones. Google has way better pictures than I can take, so... Must be getting old."
989,2017-06-25,5,"What can I say? This place is great for people of all ages. If you love animals, you'll love this place. I really love the message of keeping the oceans clean for the safety of all ocean life. It's crazy to think of all the crap that ends up out there! It's not our first visit and it definitely won't be our last. Listen to their message..."
990,2015-10-24,5,"I was so lucky! My husband and I were walking toward the main entrance, and a lady with her son stopped us and told us she had an extra pass and could let one of us in. She let me in, and I enjoyed my time here all the more! Thank you, sweet lady!Even though my last visit here was a field trip in grade school, I still enjoyed as an adult. They give you a map/guide showing you all the times for the different presentations and special exhibits. We watched the otter presentation, and it was really nice to get to know more about otters and about how Monterey Bay Aquarium is helping the endangered otters. Walking around through the different exhibits was fun. I think I was surprised at myself because of how in awe I was at some of the things I saw. There was a moment where I walked in to part of an exhibit and I was just blown away by what was in front of me. Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must-see for tourists. Can't wait to one day take my future kids here :)"
991,2015-07-20,5,"Jesus...... I love aquariums. This aquarium took it to the next level. We came around 4PM, after driving down from San Francisco. I think it is wise to buy the city pass, because it includes seeing the Monterey Bay Aquarium, California Science Museum, and also the Exploritarium or the De Young Museum. $94 for the whole package and individual passes would be $35-$45 each person.The Open Sea exhibit blew my mind. It was just so peaceful and beautiful in here. I was very inspired and awed by the beauty of the sea animals. It definitely is a good place to check out if you are not from the city or from the area. There are cafes and restaurants in the aquarium as well. Bathrooms are very clean, which is one of my biggest thing... I hate public bathrooms. There are so many interesting fishes to see! I saw some people snorkeling, taking lessons from  pro's. I definitely want to check it out next time I visit."
992,2018-05-30,5,Simply beautiful. I have been to one other aquarium in my life and was very impressed but after visiting Monterey Bay Aquarium I have thoroughly grown to appreciate the beauty and importance of marine life. The aquarium is by far my favorite place to visit in Monterey.
993,2015-08-11,5,"Hi-Ya!Parking $10, tickets--varies (buy the membership pack because it's also a tax write-off), enjoyment for pretty much everybody--worth it.I know a lot of folks have posted reviews for the aquarium already, but I'd like to add a little too:  adults and kids alike can't help, but have that look of wonder and or amazement at the exhibits there.I'll skip the main stuff a lot of peeps have already commented about, but here is an obvious freebie. On the second floor there is a kids play zone nearby the restrooms.  If you need to rest and not worry about your kids roaming about let them play in the enclosed area."
994,2017-02-14,4,"This place is great. Awesome place to bring the kiddos on a week day or weekend. Prices for a one day visit are pretty steep and if you plan on coming again later in the year you might as well get a year pass. The exhibits are cool, some are cooler than others like the open ocean aquarium ITS HUGE. They get a bit too busy for my liking some times but that's the nature of a tourist destination. Either way make sure you stop by if you are looking for a good day out."
995,2015-10-19,5,"Simply put: an amazing aquarium!You won't need more than a couple of hours to see it all, but you could easily spend the day just watching the jellyfish, kelp forest, sea otters or one of the many other exhibits.  The absolutely massive tanks and varieties of sea life are astounding.  Watching the swarming schools of anchovies split as a shark swims through, being stared down by a giant tuna or seeing an octopus change its color and texture in an instant are all fascinating to watch.At $40/ticket, it can be pricey, but there's really nothing else like it around."
996,2017-03-05,2,"We were so excited to come here from SoCal. Heard that this was the best aquarium with lots to see. Ticket were a little steep at $49 thru AAA. But thought it was worth it- turns out it was not. It took us maybe 2 hours to see everything almost twice. It was packed with screaming kids that run wild and block every viewing point. I have 6 nieces and nephews so yes I am familiar with kids. But this totally ruined it for my husband and I. We hardly got to see anything- but honestly there isn't much to even see. Otters were super cute, jellyfish, 2 octopuses, lots of fish, and the ocean view with the turtle, hammer head and stingrays. And your done! Still neat to see, I just would have rather saved my 50/ each on something else."
997,2018-05-16,4,We made an overnight trip out here. It was pretty neat. Our 1 1/2 yr old daughter loved it for the first hour and then pretty much lost interest In it. Which was expected. I just wish there was alittle more room when watching the feedings. Everyone was so cramped and the adults pushed their way in front of me and my daughter. But I think we will try it again at a later time.
998,2015-07-03,5,"First time here and I am 50 years old !  Where have I been all this time ?  I wish they had this when I was a kid.My 2015 Mother day outing started off here at Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I had never been here before so I was very excited.  We drove from Santa Clara, CA so it was a little drive.  Myself, daughter & Cousin came out to make a memorable day for Me.  Tourist everywhere !!!  Not to worry there are enough signs so you can't miss the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  We found parking really fast.  This parking lot Guy was selling parking All day for $20  so we jumped at the chance.  Just a hope skip and jump to the Aquarium. Tickets are like $40 each, students a little cheaper.  As we walked up the long zig zag line came all the way up on to the side walk along side the building.  It actually wend really fast.  They even had a employee to give out maps of the Aquarium and for sure you will need it.  Once I entered I was in amazment of all the large indoor aquarium.  There are many levels of area to venture off in So i suggest you bring your walking shoes !!  Alot of the area is very dark to see the fish in the natural water.  I hear we are not suppose to use flash.  I took so many picture as memories.  This is a super exciting place for young children to learn around the sea life.  There is never a dull moment each area has it own music and feel.  I had such a great time here with my daughter I really didn't mind the $ for the ticket.  It is well worth the adventure."
999,2016-01-04,5,"Not much to say that hasn't been said already, just giving them their well deserved stars.Beautiful job with everything guys. U had me in awe all over ur property.Very informative staff and Volunteers.Clean. And well laid out. Couldn't have asked to go somewhere better for my birthday. Always happy to ""check in"" hereGot tix online and went on a Monday. It was cake. Not many crazy kids and room to stretch ur arms. Made for a very good day."
1000,2018-01-06,5,"Be prepared for noise and crowds around exhibits that were designed for much more intimate and smaller audiences. I am a local member, and I have taken to wearing noise canceling headphones when I visit. Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother with such a crowded venue if it weren't so special.If you want understand why the entrance fee is so high you should take the behind-the-scenes tour. This tour shows you what (money and energy) it takes to sustain these beautiful animals above the water, and without their natural food sources. I have seen truck after truck pull up with huge pallets of human quality seafood into the aquarium - fresh, high quality halibut, tuna,  shrimp, etc. No doubt there is a lot of educational good going on here (which seafood is okay too eat, how to keep plastic out of the food chain, etc.) At the same time, the message is pretty sad that humankind is polluting and killing the ocean. The environmental message at the Aquarium can be a real downer. Not saying that message shouldn't be delivered, but I really have my doubts about whether most of visitors can hear such a penetrating message."
1001,2015-07-14,5,"Big, and allegedly the best in the west coast. The 28 foot high Ocean's Edge Wing (one the world's largest single-paned windows) was the first in the world to grow live California Giant Kelp and is full of 80 species of seaweed.  I'm gonna have to write a Kelp review.  Stingrays, jellyfish, and otters can be checked out both above AND below the water line.  Another tank is just like you when your order pizza- it ""holds the anchovies"" --- 3000 in fact.  There's also puffins and penguins and sea turtles.  Splash Zone is cool. But if you see Splash Zone on your hotel TV, don't order it. They spent 3.5 million on the jellyfish exhibit.... I don't think you're ready for this jellyfish exhibit."
1002,2015-06-08,5,"This is not, primarily, a review of the Aquarium itself, which of course is fantastic. This is a review of the Sea Otter Conservation Tour, available as a $15 add-on to your admission ($12 for Aquarium members). The tour lasts an hour. Is it worth it? That depends. The main focus on the tour is to explain how Monterey Bay Aquarium takes care of its otters and the local otter population. You get to see some employee-only areas, hear about the history of otter conservation in the Monterey area, and learn some interesting facts about otters. The tour guide will answer any questions you have about otters and the Aquarium, and will share some great stories. Don't expect to touch an otter, or to see otters up close in the employee-only areas. The Aquarium is primarily focused on conservation and education--it's not a zoo, per se--and they have to be careful to prevent the otters from imprinting on humans. The only live otters you'll see on the tour that you can't see with just a general admission ticket are in the rehabilitation tanks, and you'll only see them on TV screens. That's good for the otters, but probably not exciting for young kids. If you want to learn about otters and how the Aquarium benefits them, your $15 will be well-spent. We enjoyed it, and I don't regret paying for it. If you're hoping for an up-close animal experience, try a petting zoo, and leave the otters alone."
1003,2018-06-16,5,I remember coming on field trips at this place as a kid and I always had such a blast learning about ocean life. I want to visit again soon as an adult and definitely bringing my future kids here :)
1004,2018-04-19,5,"This was just outstanding. They did such a marvelous job with the layout and keeping plenty space to view at the wildlife. Amazing exhibits and I learned a ton. Loved it, I'll be back."
1005,2018-08-07,3,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon during the summer, so I expected it to be quite busy and packed. It actually was not too bad, judging how nice the weather was this day. They have a really awesome selection of fish and wildlife displays. I found the setup/architecture of the building to be be a bit inconvenient and clumsy. It would be nice if exhibits were more easily connected and accessible. It seemed my touring of the place didn't quite flow. We spent a lot of time going back and forth. It was also smaller than I expected. I was happy with the amount of time I spent there. 2 hours was just enough to take your time browsing back and forth between exhibits, I even had time to visit my favorite displays twice! Very cool setting located right on the Monterey bay. We found parking reasonably close as soon as we pulled up. They don't have a parking garage if any sort but the street parking is ample. The hallways/pathways thru exhibits is a bit narrow. Please do expect this place to be crowded a bit and touching shoulder to shoulder or brushing people as you pass. Can't come here with a ""personal space bubble"" expectation. That part didn't bother me at all though. I wish they had a few more interactive exhibits and history highlights for adults, rather than just the auditorium/listening/study zones. Very kid friendly with a cool snorkeling class so children can swim and check out the tidal pools live under sea. I'll probably come back next year to visit, definitely worth seeing at least once if you're from the Bay Area."
1006,2017-07-10,5,"Second time visiting, once while pregnant and this time with my 18 month old. She LOVED it! I'm so glad we came. I was worried that she would be too young. Nope! She got a little nervous in the ""open sea"" area because it went from tranquil to loud in a heartbeat, but that was okay, we walked outside and she became enameled with the ocean (I love that this!). She really enjoyed the bird area where she got to pretend to be a baby bird. We were there running around for a long time! (Probably only about 30 minutes in reality, but it felt like forever.)She also really loved the penguins. I can't wait to bring her back! We were here on a Sunday afternoon in July, so it was crowded (totally expected)."
1007,2017-06-19,4,"My boyfriend and I visited this aquarium for our anniversary and had a great time! We were there during ""prime time"" but the crowd honestly wasn't too bad and we were able to enjoy every exhibit. The only thing that bothered me happened at the octopus exhibit. There was a sign above its tank that clearly prohibited flash photography. Despite this sign and several constant verbal reminders from staff to stop, people continued to take close-up pictures with bright flash. If the constant flashes were enough to annoy other visitors, just imagine how the poor octopus felt! Sigh. People who do this: just stop. It's disrespectful."
1008,2017-09-02,4,"The exhibits are amazingly beautiful. The aquarium itself is beautiful, everything about it is remarkable. I made a huge mistake of taking my two little boys ON THE WEEKEND, and to top it off--a holiday weekend. So, for the amount we paid to get in, we were really let down because of the crowd sizes. You guys, it was so crowded! So much body heat caused the entire aquarium to be uncomfortably warm, my little guys couldn't see much because there was barely room to wiggle around ANYWHERE, the dark rooms made it hard to keep track of my kids because of the crowds... I would say mid week is probably ideal to come. We will come back again, hopefully when there are less people."
1009,2018-12-01,5,Very cool and well-kept. There are a lot of activities for children throughout. Everyone should experience the MBA at least once.
1010,2017-12-18,5,"Often crowded, but so worthy! The aquarium is beautifully maintained, the docents really know their stuff, and the exhibits are fascinating. The jellyfish are out of this world and we just loved the otters."
1011,2015-08-19,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is about as good as it gets for aquariums in California. The place the absolutely dripping with character, but is still very easy to navigate and explore. The only reason I am giving this establishment a four instead of five, is because of its price. Realistically you are looking at a couple hours max at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, so $39.95 for an entry fee is a little bit steep. My family came here while in-laws were visiting. They brought their three year old who absolutely loved the exhibits, and plentiful children activities. We started off going to the left side of the aquarium as you walk in. There was a ton of stuff for smaller kids to do, as well as a very impressive two story display. In the display there was plenty of fish, a diver, and their token sea kelp. Our three year old had a ton of fun petting all of the different animals, and interacting with all of the kid stuff.We stopped for lunch at the cafeteria after finishing that side of the building. Their sandwiches, salads, and pizzas are all pretty good, but absolutely overpriced and expensive. With a drink expect to pay at least 14$ a person for lunch. The water they sell comes in a recycled box for $3.50. Recycling is great, but not that great. The open sea side of the aquarium is where this place really shines. This is where you see the fantastic jellyfish displays which the aquarium is known for, as well as the huge open sea tank. The tank houses a ton of fish, shark, and a sea turtle or two. There are rooms that branch out and show a few other types of fish, as well as a few more activities for kids. Overall the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a fantastic way to spend a few hours. It would be amazing if they would reduce their pricing, and maybe make the cafeteria a little bit less opportunistic. With a ticket and lunch you are looking at roughly $55-$60 per person, not including parking. This can add up quite fast, but is worth it once or twice a year."
1012,2016-05-27,5,Wonderful place to go to especially  for kids.Cafe food is great.Try the classic mac n cheese.Brownies from the cafe is good and moist.
1013,2015-10-05,5,"Now this is an aquarium.When I was a kid, I wanted to be a marine biologist, and the two aquariums I remember the best were the National Aquarium in Baltimore and this one.  Sadly, as a Los Angeles resident, one area where we get our asses handed to us is with aquariums.  We've got the Aquarium of the Pacific, where you can barely see the penguins through the algae (granted it is in Long Beach, so... *shrug*).I hadn't been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in probably close to twenty years, and I'm happy to report it's still one of the nicest, most impressive aquariums I've ever been to.  It is pricey to get into, not the largest aquarium, and the termination point of the touristy Cannery Row, but it is still totally worth it.  Here are some reasons off the top of my head:- Unlike the Aquarium of the Pacific, where the only cleaning the outside tanks get is when a seal accidentally rubs up against the glass while falling asleep from bored sadness, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is near spotless.  It's beautifully organized and - although most people might not notice this - there's background music for certain areas.  Maybe the higher admission fees are being put to good use.- There are constant shows or feedings - you can sign up to get text alerts for unscheduled feedings - and an enormous ""Open Seas"" tank that is absolutely awe-inspiring (and further feeds my theory that the worst thing to be in Monterey is a sardine).  - Also, unlike other aquariums that are right by the water (*cough* Long Beach), this aquarium is actually set right into the bay, with the water becoming part of its tide pool area.- There's a really impressive cafeteria area (I think Aquarium of the Pacific has some pretzels and soda or something, OK I'll stop beating this dead horse).If you're in Monterey or even live anywhere by the Bay, you should make it a point to visit this fantastic aquarium.  In my mind, it's one of the most compelling attractions around.  ""Dear Bay Area, can we trade aquariums??"" - Love, LA"
1014,2018-04-13,4,I used to drive a zodiac for Longs Marine Laboratory staff photographer whose whale photos are featured here named  Bryant if memory serves was 13 years ago.Great place I love the octopus who reaches into the next display case for snacks they are really intelligent creatures.Give yourself plenty of time and try to catch the feedings in the tank by divers.
1015,2018-05-13,4,"Had a great time here with my GF, a lot to look at and a lot of great information. Parking wasn't too bad and staff was very friendly."
1016,2017-03-12,5,"the monterey bay aquarium is truly amazing! it's large... we spent two hours in there but could have spent much longer. we didn't even see any of the special shows, feedings etc... if you did that,you could easily spend all day there! i love that the aquarium only takes in injured animals as well. my favorite part was probably the room overlooking the ocean, with a natural tide coming in for some kind of birds. it was so beautiful!"
1017,2018-05-12,1,"Outrageous prices for entry, parking, and for food. Thankfully they allow you to bring in your own lunch. The Steinhart Aquarium in ""The City"" was much better as far as quantity and variety of fish on display and with way less environmental indoctrination."
1018,2015-10-05,5,"Wow this aquarium is amazing. It looks a bit outdated from the outside but don't let that fool you. I enjoyed the open ocean part of the aquarium-I was in awe watching the jelly fish, very mesmerizing. Another cool part was the one million gallon exhibit that features large blue fin tuna, a sea turtle, hammerhead shark, schools of fish, and a SHARK! It's pretty amazing. My favorite part of the aquarium is the sea otter exhibit. They are so darn cute-wish I could have one as a pet. Aside from all the noise level from the little ones running around, this place is pretty darn awesome."
1019,2017-02-26,4,"I went for the first time and I really enjoyed myself!We went on a slow day, but it also had some school children visiting.I didn't know about the itineraries, but had a blast anyway. We just took a map and went full circle checking things out. I saved the jellyfish exhibit for last since it was a my favorite. So relaxing. It's a really cool experience to see all these varieties of fish just swimming everywhere!If you plan to go, I say look up the events they have throughout the day at certain exhibits if you want to see some interesting things like feeding times, meet the otters etc.One thing that irked me was this one moment we got to see the octopus come out and like 7 people were taking pictures with flash scaring the octopus back in. Despite all these signs, I guess people prefer to show off a cool photo of an octopus than care that the flashing is freaking it out."
1020,2015-08-22,5,"This aquarium is AMAZING and worth the pricey admissions fee. We were in Monterey for the weekend and we're thinking about visiting the aquarium on Sunday morning but by the time we got there, the line was all the way down the street so we decided to go the next morning. However, since we walked from Pacific Grove to the Wharf, we walked by the aquarium on Sunday afternoon on the way back and saw that the line was gone so we went for it. We got inside and realized that they were opened later than usual for Evenings by the Bay and even had a jazz band playing at 6:30pm. We went through all of the exhibits and my favorite was The Jelly Experience.  It was awesome!  And even more amazing because my fiancé is such a Jimi Hendrix fan so he was so enamored by the quotes on the wall and all the psychedelic touches. I was obsessed with the jelly fish... they were so beautiful and their movement captivates me. I could spend all day in the jelly exhibit or spend all day talking about them, but I won't. We touched a few things and I even let a hermit crab walk on my hand - ewww! I hate feeling little legs... and we also saw a shark egg sack thing with a little shark fetus moving around inside - it was crrrrrazy!  The jazz bands were great too and it is great to see so much talent in our youth. Overall, it was such a great experience and I want to do it every time we're in Monterey!"
1021,2015-08-13,4,"This review is specific to the sleepover at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Have you ever gotten no sleep but been happy about it? OK, other than that time in college you went to Cabo, or the first two months of dating someone new? Well that's how I felt leaving after spending a night in the MB Aquarium. It's a unique experience, and the staff do a great job coordinating everything. It's quite a feat to coordinate and manage hundreds of people--many of them children--but they make it look easy.We loved being able to see the exhibits without the crowds, to take the behind-the scenes tours, feed the bat rays, and to roam the place while it was nearly empty. There's a great orientation where they tell you the benefits of each area where you can camp out (for instance, if there's a well-lit tank to act as a night light). We camped by the massive tank in the Vanishing Wildlife area. It was a great spot, but we were sharing the area with an utterly inconsiderate group of screechy girl scouts. Did we care? Yeah, it was annoying but those of us who kept getting woken up by them spent a good part of the night staring at the tank full of sardines, hammerheads, tuna, anchovies, and other beautiful creatures. Just so you don't get the wrong idea, I walked by other areas and they were quiet. So you can find a quiet spot if you're aware of your fellow campers and choose your sleeping spot accordingly. We simply chose . . . poorly.The next morning they served a very respectable buffet, and we shopped in the gift shop before they threw us out so they could open to the general public. It's a great experience!"
1022,2016-10-04,3,"My eyes popped out of my head when I saw the cost of admission ($49.95 for an adult, $30 for a three year old). Monterey Bay Aquarium wins for most expensive admission for a museum-type experience I've been to on three continents. The place was magical, but when my three-year-old wanted to leave after an hour, I felt I'd wasted my money. Don't go if you have a toddler. Wait until your child is at least seven if you want to get your money's worth.I think that $130 admission for a family of three passes the tipping point between educational experience and luxury consumption. The second-most expensive museum I've been to, Cal Academy of Science, was $36 for an adult, and I thought that was already in the realm of the unreasonable. While it's believable that this actually is needed for operating costs, the huge differential in cost between this and similar institutions makes me think the Aquarium doesn't have a good development program for reeling in high-value donors, and isn't a truly committed educational institution. Nice museum. Questionable values."
1023,2017-03-07,5,"This aquarium is simply beautiful! The jellyfish exhibit is simply magical. When you walk in, you feel like a kid again. I could sit there and watch them all day. They have a great combination of indoors and outdoors and many kid-friendly exhibits to get to interact with marine life. I was able to touch a sting ray :) It was a great day."
1024,2017-05-12,5,"This is one of my favorite aquariums in the world! We visit about once a year, and I always feel like a kid in a candy store! The exhibits are all beautiful, and there's always something new to see. That being said, do not miss the sea otter feeding, and the octopus and jellyfish exhibits. There's also a great touch area for kids to get interactive with rays and other aquatic life.The location is great, with amazing views of the Pacific, and the aquarium is wonderfully integrated with its natural environs. Wild sea birds and otters are not infrequent visitors to the rock pools outside.The staff & volunteers here are very knowledgable and enthusiastic - they do a good job engaging visitors, and provide interesting bits of information. The focus on conservation is authentic and very inspiring to say the least. Do note that there are no large mammals like whales and dolphins (which definitely do not belong in captivity), and they're certainly not dancing/performing for you (thank God & the aquarium for that!) Yes, it is pricey but worth it. Membership is definitely a good idea if you plan to visit more than twice a year.To sum up, Monterey Bay Aquarium will give you a real feel of the interaction between the ocean, the  animals that call it home, and us who live on shore. You'll also get a new appreciation of how we can take better care of the ocean. Honestly, once you have been to the this aquarium, every other looks . . . ordinary."
1025,2015-10-03,4,"This is a great place to bring your kids. It's a lot of fun with tons of great animals to see and things for them to do, including inside play areas and play equipment type stuff, and hands on animals like hermit crabs and starfish.There is a lot of great information and education tools regarding all the fish and animals displays, and plenty of kind and helpful volunteers strolling around looking for people to answer questions and help.My only complaint is the price. It's $40 per person now, ($39.95), with practically no discounts available. (There is a $2 discount for tickets purchased from a AAA office), but that's hard to get without prior planning. Also the prices of the souvenirs and things are way overpriced too. That's to be expected, but in my opinion they should be 40% less and they would still make a ton on money. The one great improvement since we'd been there last is the food. They have many more choices and the prices aren't too bad, and they even have sodas with free refills! Also they have moved the table area to a glass walked area that is great for viewing the bay and the animals or possibly whales out in it. Great place to bring your family, but certainly pricey. Next time we go to Monterey maybe instead of the aquarium we will take that money and go spend it on cool stuff to keep down on cannery row. You can get a lot of cool souvenir clothes and trinkets for that money."
1026,2017-06-14,5,"We recently visited for the first time in over 10 years and was simply wonderful. The animal displays were clean and full. The sea otters, penguins, and jelly fish were a favorite. They even had marine artwork and interactive displays for the kids. You will pay a hefty price for admission, but there are family passes available where you can go multiple times and bring family or guests. Great family activity!!!"
1027,2016-10-19,3,"I've been visiting this aquarium about every 5 years since they opened more than 30 years ago. I'm disappointed that the experience they provide is continuously changing tack in the direction of entertainment over education. The most jarring experience on a recent visit was in the new ""Baja"" exhibit. They have several exhibits that feature a flat panel video where live animals had been displayed. In one area is a large floor to ceiling interactive video game where people can manipulate virtual fish. Opposite to this is a real tank, populated with beautiful fish native to the Baja peninsula. As we passed by, the vast majority of children and adults were busy playing with the video game while the real tank was ignored. This trend was apparent throughout the aquarium, gimmicky video games and interactive displays. One whole section was devoted to an area where people could sit at a monitor and make an ""angry face"" and have that projected on the wall above. Fun fun fun. Do kids really need all the games and technology to learn anything anymore? Does the aquarium need to look like a playground to hold relevance for children?"
1028,2013-07-06,5,"If I win the lottery, sign me up for the rich man's lava lamp: an in-house jellyfish wall.  Jellies are my favorite undersea animals and are the reason I make repeated pilgrimages to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.Hugging the rich waters of Monterey Bay, this former canning factory is truly one of the must-see attractions in California.  The employees and volunteers are incredible in their attitude and the knowledge that they share with visitors is first-rate."
1029,2015-07-13,5,"If you don't fall in love with the the Jellies then you are a cold fish!A must stop. Fun for the whole family. Sounds corny I know, but there really is something to attract everyone in your group with beautiful and strange creatures to see and lots of info for the techies."
1030,2015-07-06,5,"+ come pet a sting ray+ come pet a starfish+ come look at sharks+ come look at turtles+ come look at jellyfish+ come look at octopus+ come look at birds+ come look at otters+ come learn about the impact of pollution on ocean habitats+ come learn about more sustainable fish eating practices -  lose out on $40The bottom line?  A very worthwhile visit to behold the wonders of the deep sea.  A number of attractions for both young and old.  They do have ordained feeding times for most of the exhibits in case you really want to watch an otter eat or something.  Clean, well maintained, and good for dates and families alike."
1031,2016-02-20,4,"Always fun to visit this place on field trips with my kiddos. A few down sides would be the parking and over priced food in the cafe. I know that down Cannery row there are many eating options, but if you're on a strict no leaving the Aquarium rule you end up spending $40 for some pizza and a few diet colas. Other than that, the exhibits were amazing and my eyeballs endured much amazement. My favorite part of the aquarium, would be the large shark tank with different types of sharks!"
1032,2016-02-17,5,"One of the best places on earth to get in touch with the ocean!  People of all ages will find something amazing here.  Prices are reasonable but I recommend purchasing a membership.  2 visits will more than make up for it!  We are always amazed by the sea life, regardless of how many times we come here.  They also have a nice looking cafe that we did not have a chance to check out."
1033,2018-02-12,5,This place is wonderful for my kids. we keep visiting Monterey Bay Aquarium because we love it. When you come to monterey  never miss this place. This aquarium is third largest aquarium in California and 8th largest in USA.
1034,2017-10-16,5,"This is one of the best aquariums in the US.  Many of the tanks are gigantic and offer great views of aquatic animals.  The kelp forest is visible from all three floors and be sure to visit the third floor where you can see the equipment that maintains the environment for the kelp.  We saw a ""feeding"" in the kelp forest.  Very friendly and informative.  The otter tank is extremely popular and difficult to get near to, but totally worth it to watch them swim and play.  There was a sea bird room where the birds actually have no barrier to keep them in.  The docent told us that at night the birds will find places to sleep within the building, but they always come back into their area in the morning.  Some of the birds have been found injured in the wild.  They are brought to the aquarium to recover and then are released back into the wild.  The message at the aquarium is to respect nature and to be more environmentally friendly by recycling and not tossing trash indiscriminately.  That one little wrapper you drop at the beach *is* important when multiplied by the millions of people who think their ""one little thing"" won't make a difference.  It can easily take three to four hours to properly visit this place.  It's extremely kid friendly.  There are many activities just for children.  Loved it here and can't wait to come back."
1035,2017-06-07,4,"This place is definitely worth seeing. I will say it is very expensive and I understand they have higher prices because it's also a research facility but it's pricey. Worth going to, even just for the view on the back observation deck. The kids had a great time and so did the rest of the family. Especially the touch pools! Touch a starfish and a decorative crab!! Wish I had more time in the area  because there seemed to be lots to walk to right next to the aquarium!"
1036,2015-09-15,5,Love this place!My 2nd time in 2 yrs and I don't mind going here every year.Food in the cafe is really expensive tho.
1037,2015-06-08,4,"I was shocked at entrance fee! $40 p/p is pretty steep, particularly when you consider that we got through the entire aquarium in an hr. They were extremely crowded on a Friday (late morning), to the point of having to wait in line practically before moving up to where you could briefly see the exhibits before getting out of the way of the waiting throngs. Most impressive by far were the jellyfish exhibits. Beautiful and photogenic! The gift shops across the street provide more local souvenirs if you're not into stuffed whales."
1038,2017-07-31,5,Great experience. I have been here several years ago and they have added many new exhibits since then. I would recommend skipping the shows early in the day and visiting the the exhibits. This place gets super crowded very quickly. I would also recommended eating here as the food was amazing and reasonable priced considering the area.
1039,2017-06-29,5,Oh my- what can I say. Packed as it should be for such a great place. My teen as well as 2.5 yo had a great time but packed by the oh-so-fun sea otter feeding.Tons of helpful staff.Indoor and outdoor areas (cool unless sunny).Lots of hands on for the kids.Restaurant looked clean but we didn't eat there.The family membership gets to be a great deal if you have a few kids or will be back even once in the upcoming year.
1040,2017-02-17,4,Overall this aquarium is a popular place to visit when your in the Monterey area.  There is a good variety of different sea/ocean life to observe.  And there is a variety of kid friendly stations for them to feel included.  The gift shop has a wide variety of memorable things to buy for you or someone you love.
1041,2017-05-14,4,"A visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium makes for a really enjoyable afternoon out! It's pretty busy on the weekend, but I would say it's worth a visit, particularly for the young ones. The rescued sea otter exhibit alone was worth the trip; watching those sea otters splash around in all their hyperactive glory was definitely the highlight of my visit!"
1042,2016-01-31,4,Great place to bring kids with all of the interactive things they have. There is plenty of room and the windows are big enough for large groups to see all the animals without feeling overcrowded. Around $40 for adults. $5 off with a student ID.
1043,2015-12-12,5,"What an awesome place! I've been coming here for the past 3 decades. I enjoyed it each & every visit, time well spent.  The kelp forest is pretty cool & it's fun to watch the diver feed all the fish. They even hand feed the shark!  There's a large variety of sea life throughout the aquarium all of various sizes and forms.  It so interesting to see the diversity in organisms. My absolute favorite part is the Open Sea exhibit with its constant motion like the open ocean. It's the Aquarium's largest exhibit, a place where tuna & sharks speed past, sardines swarm in huge, glittering schools & sea turtles swim lazily across the 90-foot window. Nearby, colorful puffins await their next meal, & brilliant jellies pulse through the water. The enormous scale is incredible. It's not just the scale of the tank, but also the size of the creatures in the tank & the way that they interact with each other. It really must be seen in person to be fully appreciated. I recommend taking a moment to sit in the upper observation area to fully appreciate the spectacle on display. Be sure to visit for the 11am feeding, the tuna dart past at speeds approaching 30mph.It can get crazy packed on weekends & holidays, but you will find virtually empty during a weekday. It's absolutely worth every red cent & then some for the $30 entry. Memberships are available for frequent visitors. Not only do they get a members only entrance, they are offered special access without the general public in attendance. I'll definitely be coming back!"
1044,2017-10-16,1,"We thought we would take our Granddaughter to the Aquarium this morning for a fun time.  What we didn't realize is that we would be broke in the process.  Entrance fees are completely outrageous, plus they charge nearly $30.00 for a four year old child!!!!?????  Really??  No senior discount offered, no military discount offered.  Well we paid because we were there and the Grandbaby was excited to go, but it took all of our budget for the day. So no fun lunch out after. Once inside we couldn't see any of the exhibits because adults were pushing children aside so they could get in front to take pictures.  I literally saw a grown man, push a child away from an exhibit so he could stand in front of it and have his wife take a picture.  An Aquarium employee, or volunteer was right there and saw it and did nothing.  Not a fun place.  Crazy expensive plus the windows on most of the exhibits were filthy with hand prints and who knows what else.  This Nana would not waste her time or money again.If their mission is truly to educate, as they claim, the cost for children four and under four should be free.  Children over four should be no more then $15.00.  Before you go double check the entrance fees.. Be assertive about senior or military discounts.  Their prices are completely outrageous and apparently they won't offer you any discount as with us.  Good luck."
1045,2013-02-19,4,"Immediately upon entering, our first instinct is to find the sea otters. Much to our dismay, the otter habitat was closed for reconstruction. Awww, bummer! Just watching those little cuties swim and play in the water is so entertaining.Despite not being able to see the otters, we watched the penguins in their little habitat. There are pufflings, sharks in a ginormous sea tank, sea turtles, I don't recall seeing them several years ago. There is an interactive children's area, where the little ones can touch live sting rays, sea cucumber, sea anemone and numerous other sea creatures. Seeing the jellyfish tank is quite awesome, and so is the school of fish swimming around in this circular window that encompasses the ceiling of the entryway to the jellyfish exhibit.Now the entrance fee has gone up to $34.95 for adults and my teen was $32.95. I think the kids price is $21.95. On the day we went there was an hour wait and the aquarium was swamped with people. My daughter claims it was even more crowded when she went with her grandparents. In my opinion, this aquarium is well maintained and has so much to see. I've been to the aquarium in Chicago and it wasn't nearly as nice as this. although the price is a little steep, it can be a fun, entertaining and educational visit for all ages. There is an outdoor viewing area which overlooks the Monterey Bay, there are a number of telescopes to look through and on my visit there five years ago, I got to witness a school of dolphins! You never know what you'll encounter!"
1046,2015-11-24,5,"Stopped in at the aquarium with the family.  Lots  to look at. My girls got to stick their fingers in the tide pools to touch little live creatures. I passed on the experience and instead opted to just look with my eyes LoL  I suggest doing 1/2 of the aquarium when they open, grabbing lunch getting and return to finish the rest. They allow in and outs if you have your hand stamped. We brought snacks but were still starving . Its such a cool experience that you don't wanna rush through it because of an empty stomach."
1047,2015-09-07,5,"Love the aquarium, the animals are a little nuts and by animals I mean people. ;-) Minus the crowds along with their germs this place is amazing. Took my 9 month old here today and he only cried when we had to change his diaper in the smelly bathroom. The room with the ginormous tank which housed the sea turtles, hammerhead sharks, tuna, and dolphin fish was incredible! It literally had my son clapping. The jellyfish are also quite stunning.Brave the crowd and take your family here! It won't disappoint!"
1048,2017-11-30,5,"Prices up to $49~ but if you stay at an affiliated hotel you get 2 days for the price of one, which IMHO is more than enough to see mostly everything if you haven't ever been or haven't been in a while.This time around we came on the Monday & Tuesday after Thanksgiving - it worked out perfectly this way in terms of crowds. We came Monday afternoon for a few hours and it was awesome. The Open Sea exhibit was amazing to be in with virtually nobody around at a quarter till 5... Same thing when we went back shortly after they opened Tuesday morning ;) On either day and during the times we visited, it was pretty uncrowded in general.Love coming here whenever we get the chance. I'm just glad this time I didn't ruin my GoPro in the ray touch pool (on that note: think twice about dipping a GoPro in because the attendants may scowl and wag their fingers at you... I'm not sure why because there are probably thousands of filthy hands dipped in that water on a daily basis and my GoPro case is probably cleaner than all of them. If cleanliness isn't an issue, I'm not sure what would be - I'm not attacking the rays or trying to harm them, and I wasn't aware that video footage was prohibited in the aquarium in certain places. There are no signs indicating so, at least)"
1049,2015-08-11,5,"Very impressed. Well executed concept, the exhibits are great, the decoration of the place is very appealing and the layout helps visitors to visit all of the areas. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The Aquarium gives you the feeling of been a ""science oriented"" version of Sea World. Great combination of animal exhibits and media elements. Highly recommended for parents who want their kids to have fun while learning about the animals that lived in the ocean. For parking, there are a couple of structures and lots around the aquarium, be prepared to pay around $30 on the weekend."
1050,2018-03-25,5,We went on a Friday and it was perfect. Parking was easy to find and wasn't too crowded inside. The aquarium has two wings and upstairs so it's pretty big. I like that you can go outside and get some fresh air. I would definitely take my family again in the near future.
1051,2018-10-26,5,Love love love the aquarium! Seriously one of the my favorite places in the world. The staff is so informative and nice! The tanks are huge and filled with life and so much educational information is throughout the space. I loved everything about the aquarium and cannot wait to come back some day!
1052,2016-09-01,2,"Absolute disappointment. I was so excited to come to the aquarium in Monterey, but was ultimately let down by their offerings. Way way too many artificial exhibits and videos and not enough actual wildlife. I visited the Long Beach Aquarium last year and was blown away by how amazing it was and totally expected the same scenario here, but sadly, not even close. It had an overall touristy Disney-esque feel and the shops surrounding the aquarium were awful as well. With a $50 price for an adult admission, in my opinion, it just isn't worth the cost."
1053,2015-11-20,5,I fell in love with this place. So many beautiful creaturesMy favorite view was jellyfishes. So beautiful. It's pink :)I went alone and it felt so nice to knowing we have beautiful creatures/animals in the world. I will come back with family or boo next time Make sure you take a lot picturesAnd also you can touch ray :). It's smooth :)
1054,2017-04-15,5,This place is very amazing. It teaches you a lot about the ocean and the sea life. The only downfall is its very crowded but they still get five stars for me because it is an amazing place. We will definitely come back.
1055,2017-08-06,4,"Amazing place! It was clean and the jellyfish exhibit was incredible. Also enjoyed the octopus and squid tanks. My 4 year old really enjoyed the hands on parts, levers and buttons and he spent 30 minutes handling the little critters upstairs. Only reasons for 4 stars: the admission price was too much (in my opinion) and it was super crowded. At times, the crowds were overwhelming. So paying the inflated entrance fee (and parking) and when we got in, had to be a little aggressive to get a turn looking at the fish etc. Some adults seem to forget there are little kids trying to observe the sea animals as they would take multiple selfies and block others from being able to see (not directly the museums fault). Compared to the tiny aquarium in Honolulu, this place rocked..."
1056,2016-02-27,5,"This place is the best place to visit while in Monterey.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium is the best value for locals.  The Individual (single) Membership is $75.00 a year (also tax deductible), considering that the general admission entrance fee is $39.95 per adult.  The exhibits as just a great wonder of the Monterey Bay and beyond. Plan on spending at least four hours or more here.  There is a lot to see.I am especially fond of the jelly fish exhibits, but the Open Sea is really worth the time to visit and see marine life. There are gift shops and food service as well as a full service restaurant. If you do become a member, I recommend that you take advantage of early opening hours and late evening events during the summer.  Usually, less crowded and a chance to network."
1057,2016-12-21,5,"Recently visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium for a second time and loved every minute of it, even as an adult! The aquarium offers a range of activities suited for children and adults alike. There are a number of touch pools to get up close and personal with marine life, including touching sting rays! Check the schedule they give you for the feedings for animals throughout the aquarium. We watched the otter, penguin and kelp forest feedings because we were able to plan our visit to different exhibits around the times that feedings are offered. Get there early for the feedings - especially the penguins and otters were very crowded. The best place to view the otter feeding is the second floor balcony, and you need to show up at least 15 minutes early to get a good spot. They also gave the otters frozen blocks of water filled with shrimp. This happened BEFORE the official feeding, so we got a double dose of otter cuteness. The penguin feeding is right nearby many of the children's activities and touch pools, so it gets even more crowded. If you want a front-row view, plan to camp out 20 minutes early! The jellyfish exhibit is spectacular - check out the photos in the yelp gallery to see what you're in for because words don't do the wildlife justice! As a child, I was mesmerized the first time I came to MBA's jelly exhibit and as an adult, I couldn't stop taking cool pictures and studying the many different species in this exhibit. SO COOL! The cafeteria offers great views of the bay and is a pretty place to catch a break from the exhibits to grab a bite. We read that the cafe has great food, but ate a big brunch beforehand so we didn't try it. Tickets are pricey - if you have a student ID you can get in for $40 instead of $50. We stayed at an airbnb nearby that offered 2 free passes to the aquarium. If you're planning on going to the aquarium, seeking out an airbnb that offers this is a great option to save some cash! It's expensive for a 2 hour visit, but the exhibits are well done, feedings are fun to watch, and there's something for everyone. This is one of the best aquariums I've ever been to!"
1058,2015-11-19,5,Went here for a private dinner event.  This place is so awesome.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Great for kids to learn about our underworld.
1059,2017-06-12,5,"I'm partial to the Stephen Birch Aquarium in La Jolla because I'm from that area, but I have to admit I love this place!  The price seems high but it is such a magnificent place, it is worth every penny!  The variety of species is wonderful. The aquariums are beautiful!  Other exhibits are engaging for all ages. Although some are brilliantly designed for young children with many opportunities for touching, pushing buttons, getting your hands wet, and scrambling about. We didn't get to experience everything so I recommend a two or more day pass.   I would love to spend more time watching the octopuses. We were also able to view whales passing by and otter in the wild.  I can't wait to go again!"
1060,2018-05-08,5,"This is a wonderful place that educates everyone about the wonders of the sea life in the Monterey bay area (except they do have visiting penguins).  Obviously, the sea otters are the favorite attraction since they are so cute.   The grandchildren simply loved the hands-on exhibits, rays, crabs, kelp.  This is a must see attraction. Please become a member to support the critical research they do."
1061,2015-06-10,4,"For starters, Yes, dear husbeast, this is where they filmed parts of a star trek movie. As we arrived we found out that this was National Oceans weekend. What did this mean? Lots of tables of different vendors. Lots of different people there, children and adults that were there to experience the aquarium at its finest. Since the husband likes to see things behind the scenes.. we went on the behind the scenes tour, which was pretty awesome. Seeing all the things that people don't usually get to see, like the food that the animals and fish get to eat. Seeing what the habitats look like beyond the glass. Especially the kelp forest! The set up for that is pretty awesome. I loved the Jelly fish and the tentacle exhibits, those were large and amazing. And the deep sea exhibit was pretty cool too! I'd come back if I was in the area again!"
1062,2018-08-01,4,"We spent a couple nights in Monterey, and the hotel we were staying at had two days for the price of one tickets. The tickets were expensive for the seven of us, but it was nice to be able to take our time and do the aquarium over two days. My daughters and nieces loved the big aquariums, there were several big fish that were amazing and weird, like the sunfish, and a huge tuna that must have weighed a couple hundred pounds. The smaller exhibits were also nice, one of my daughters became entranced by the tropical fishes, she would have spent hours there if we had more time."
1063,2018-04-21,5,"It might be a bit expensive, but they have a lot of mouths to feed! And the work the aquarium does is amazing. As are all the exhibits. It's none stop action between the feedings, the movies, the touch experiences and on and on. Every visit is unique and fun. A fantastic way to spend the day!"
1064,2016-04-07,4,"Considered to be one of the best aquariums in the whole country, it definitely holds up to that title.I remember having a great time here when I went as a kid, and I still had that same excitement when I went very recently. I came here on a Sunday, very soon after it opened because I knew it would be busy. After about an hour, there was already more people in the place than I anticipated. Be warned that it is a huge tourist attraction (a very great one at least) so expect a lot of families with their kids. There was so many people that my girlfriend actually felt quite claustrophobic.My favorite exhibit here is The Deep Sea , which is extremely fascinating; with a 20,000 gallon tank making it a grand sight to behold. What is neat about this place is that throughout the other exhibits, there also a theme of ocean preservation and has small descriptions and interactive media on the topic.Also, If you find park in the lot closest to the aquarium, the machine gives out dollar coins for change!"
1065,2018-04-07,3,"Great tech and aquarium. Not worth 50 bucks, maybe 30ish at best. 4.5-5 for aquarium, 3 in price."
1066,2016-04-22,5,"Best way to get fantastic pictures of sea creatures without going diving yourself! Also great practice if you're trying to improve or test your photography skills since it's one of the most challenging places to try to take pictures due to no flash allowed, how dark it is, and crowds!Also do yourself a favor and get a map of the place otherwise you might miss some stuff. First time I visited I almost missed the seahorses because the way the place is designed with twists and turns and subdued lighting everywhere it's easy to miss a section! Also there are sections outside that I'm guessing a lot of people miss because they probably don't think they can go out there or into certain sections."
1067,2018-04-19,5,Parking garages are nearby. Awesome customer service. Love the otter exhibit and the touch pools!
1068,2018-10-08,4,Always a blast.  Did not realize they have daily in n out privileges! Love the aquarium but can't stand the wharf cannery...
1069,2018-04-06,5,"Well worth the fun and education. Also, if you stay at participating hotels, you get 2 visits for the price of one!"
1070,2018-03-17,5,"This aquarium is great! It is very pricey, but there is so much do to it is *mostly* worth it. If you're visiting from out of town I feel like you just have to go to say you've been. Finding dory was based off of it and they've done a beautiful job upkeeping it and their enclosures are spacious and well made. They have a TON of stuff to do with kids so I mainly recommend it if you have kids, but even 2 adults can spend 2-3+ hours walking around!"
1071,2018-04-17,5,I love the aquarium. It is one of the best ones that I have been to. Every time I go I feel like I'm in a different place with all the exhibits and shows.
1072,2017-05-07,4,"YES, YOU SHOULD GOWe love marine life and water and are residents of the bay area. It was a return visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium after several years. Downsides: It cost too much & Lots of tourists.It was $50.00 per person to get in. A bit high and unnecessary I believe. Plus, you have to pay to part down the street and walk to it which adds another $15.00-$28.00 just for the parking. The place was packed with tourists so it was a little frustrating to get through the place.Upsides: Beautiful ocean life and education on the the water and ocean life as well as seeing the ocean views themselves from their deck but you can get that for free outside. It is beautiful and it is good to see at least once. The work they do is great and they provide important information on saving the environment. I would donate to their research but I'm kinda disappointed that they charged us so much just to get in."
1073,2016-09-10,5,"Having been to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, I was super excited to visit this aquarium! It is huge! The exhibits were astounding and the sea life here is beautiful. The main attraction was the giant tank with the hammerhead sharks and tuna swimming around. If you stay there long enough, you'll see the big fish eating the little ones. I know it sucks but that's what they do.Being Labor Day weekend, it was busy and packed with tourists but the aquarium is so big we hardly noticed. It is dark in some parts so if you come with grandma & grandpa, make sure that they don't have any problems navigating the exhibits."
1074,2018-05-01,5,"My family had a wonderful time here. The aquarium is beautiful, unique, and very educational. There are so many different exhibits for adults and children, and it is located overlooking the gorgeous Monterey Bay! The food is a little pricey, but that is to be expected. My fiance even lost his wallet and someone was kind enough to return it to lost and found. Everything was there when we got to it! Overall great experience."
1075,2014-12-22,5,"We had an amazing day at the Monterey Bay Aquarium!Though it is a far drive from Lake Merritt, we thought it would be a great day trip.  I brought my friend here about 2 months ago and we really did not get to enjoy everything due to time constraints, so it was time for a re-visit.  She really enjoyed the small aquarium in SF a few months ago, so why not take her to the BIG aquarium where she can be mesmerized by the fish all day long?  We arranged for a rental car for the drive, something way more roomie and comfortable than either 2 seat vehicle at our disposal.  We grabbed our rental and were on our way.We arrived in Monterey early enough to really enjoy our time.  We were given complimentary tickets and cashed them in today.  There were tons of families and fish enthusiasts all around the area.We enjoyed so many exhibits.  I think the best was the large tank full of hammerhead sharks, sting rays, large tortoises, and big yellow fin tuna.  We probably spent over an hour in this particular location.  We ventured through the jelly fish area to reach our destination...well worth the trip.After this, we discovered the ""touch pool"" where we could 'pet' fish and other sea creatures.  We also toured the octopus exhibit which was one of my favorite spots of the day.There was so much to do, so many things to see, and a whole new world of discovery.  From the sea otters to the clown fish, this was such a wonder way to release stress from the day to day hum drum.  Thank you Monterey  Bay Aquarium for allowing us to have a relaxing day out of town--but not too far.  We will be back for sure!Stephani Smiles for MBA ;)"
1076,2018-04-30,5,Monterey Aquarium is a must visit for anyone around here and the Bay Area.  2 million visitors can't be wrong!  They are amazing and help immensely with conservation.
1077,2015-08-30,5,"Definitely one of the best aquariums i have been to especially with how it sits right on the water where you can watch a fleet of birds going crazy and waves crashing in the sun. The whole place was well organized and while it was super crowded, we did go on a Sunday afternoon so that was our bad. Best parts: jellies, tentacles, otters."
1078,2016-08-06,1,"I was pretty disappointed when I came here today.I feel like the aquarium has a lot less animals/fish/creatures than before.  There are tons of people.....everywhere.  So, if you don't like being bumped into, having morons cut directly in front of you without a care in the world, and lazy parents sitting on the display cases while texting, not paying attention to their bratty little children rolling around on the floor, then I would not suggest this place for you.The employees are friendly, but, for how small the aquarium is & dealing with out of control kids + their parents, the price of the tickets are outrageous.Carson C.El Dorado Hills, CA"
1079,2017-10-27,4,I'm just here to see the otters. They are so cute and swim around and do tricks. My advice is to get there a bit early to make sure you get a good spot by the glass to see the otter show. Good luck!
1080,2017-03-23,5,The sea otter conservation tour was amazing and the tour guide we so friendly and informative.10/10 would do it again!
1081,2018-04-29,5,Love the Monterey bay aquarium. So much to see and do there. The cafe there is nice. We have a membership there and we go almost every weekend. My favorite part of the aquarium is the octopus portion.
1082,2015-05-30,5,"Monterey Bay aquarium is World Class.Opened in 1984, it was founded (and funded) by David Packard, the ""P"" in HP, another world class entity.  This is a nonprofit institution and a renowned research center, but people love it for its exhibits.Admission is $40 for adults, and about half that for children.  The architecture is stunning, and it is best if one plans to spend an entire day there, since there is so much to see.  Every day has a rhythm, and there are feedings, movies,  and events scheduled for virtually every hour of every day.  Upon entry, someone will hand the day's schedule to you, and offer to help you find where you want to go.  It is an extremely well-run organization.  It is also spotlessly clean and neat, despite thousands of folks visiting each day.Although one can obtain a re-entry handstamp, the cafeteria within the aquarium is quite nice, and prices are rather reasonable, so stay in, and eat.  Or, sit outside on one of the several overlook areas and enjoy the beautiful view of Monterey Bay. And, if you are lucky, spot some frolicking sea otters below, near the rocky shoreline.  The coffee is excellent, and just sitting for a few minutes and absorbing the scenery can be quite relaxing.For the brave ones, there is a bat ray petting pool.  You can touch one as it glides by, an activity not meant for the squeamish.  There are so many incredible exhibits, and several feedings to watch.  The feedings are narrated and are amazingly informative.Interestingly, there is a very nice exhibit of shore birds in a separate section, with a wave machine providing small onshore waves to complete the natural setting.  The birds love it  there!Locate the Puffin exhibit and watch these nutty little birds for a while.  They are fine entertainment.It will be a day well spent at this magnificent institution."
1083,2017-03-22,5,A must see Aquarium! Perfect for young and old and set in beautiful Monterey. We go at least once a year with friends and family. Mid week is the best  time . I could spent the entire day watching the Jellyfish!  Hope you enjoy it!
1084,2018-04-12,5,"Outstanding! It has been years since we last visited (20+) and so much has been added and improved. We went on a Wednesday morning in April and it wasn't terribly crowded--But I can imagine what it must be like in summer or vacations. Don't miss the penguin feeding. We especially enjoyed that, the octopuses, and the huge kelp forest. Good food in on-site cafe."
1085,2015-05-26,5,"I'm always amazed at all the sea life they have here! It makes me really appreciate the ocean and the effort they put in to preserve it! I LOVE the jellies! BTW Super crowded on holidays, if you can avoid it come on a non-holiday."
1086,2018-09-30,5,Amazing aquarium! We vacation in the area every year and always visit here.. it's such a fun learning experience for kids as well although it does get pretty packed it's worth it!
1087,2017-04-25,5,"As a student and I got in for free through CSUMB. My boyfriend and I had an amazing time, they have a lot going on right now although personally I loved the tentacles exhibit! Would go again just for this exhibit. The Baja exhibit was great too, very kid AND adult friendly. Next week I will be taking my kindergarten class on a field trip there. Showing at the Monterey Bay aquarium can be good for both a romantic date AND for kids!"
1088,2016-09-21,4,My 1st visit to this aquarium and it was quite memorable! I love how the layout is easy to navigate around. We were able to get to each exhibit perfectly fine without asking the guides/employees.The only reason why I wasn't able to give them 5 stars was because I felt like there should have been more interactive scheduled events...Overall it was a nice date!
1089,2018-10-26,5,Beautiful aquarium and so much fun! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The habitats are well kept and the animals are beautiful. My favorite part is the ocean education!
1090,2015-03-17,5,"This is hands down the best aquarium, and probably the best educational attraction, that I've ever been too. It's good for all ages and has enough content to keep you entertained for almost an entire day. Make sure to at least glance at every display, because even the tiniest little windows can contain some cool looking critter or a bit of clever interactivity.Exhibits:The highlights of the museum were: the jellyfish exhibit (NOT the Jellies Experience), Tentacles, and Open Sea. Those exhibits contained a ton of beautiful and colorful creatures I'd never seen before, including Jellyfish that flashed rainbow colors. The Jellies Experience was very childish (our party was all adults) and was just a stripped down version of the jellyfish exhibit on the floor above. There was a bit of redundancy from exhibit to exhibit, but make sure to stop and look at each one, or you'll miss the little things. One of the neatest exhibits I saw was a tiny little window where you could turn a crank to make the water flow around. As the water started flowing, you could watch all the barnacles inside reach out these little webs to start filtering food from the water. That little bit of interactivity really made the exhibit enjoyable.Shows:They have a number of shows going on throughout the day, some of which are in the theatre, some of which are feedings at the animal's tanks. They also have unscheduled feedings which you can sign up to get text messages to alert you to. If you want to see the feedings, make sure to show up at least 10-15 minutes early to get close to the glass and enjoy a good view. For the shows in the theatre, we were able to walk right in and sit down at show time.Personally I didn't think the penguin or otter feedings were that interesting, since it was mostly just tossing out food with a bit of commenting on the names and ages of the animals. The ""Mysteries of the Deep"" show in the theatre was not a movie as expected, but instead a very knowledgable marine biologist showing cool clips of deep sea creatures and answering questions. I definitely recommend going to the ""Mysteries of the Deep"" show."
1091,2016-01-21,5,Such an amazing aquarium! We go often as our daughter loves it and we just can't seem to get enough of this place. The feedings are fun to watch and I love the speakers and learning more from them. It totally adds to the experience. It's also alot of fun to just come during the week when the crowds aren't as bad and to just slowly cruise through and enjoy all the sea life. They also have changing exhibits that keep it extra fresh and exciting.
1092,2015-09-21,4,"A huge aquarium with a ton of exhibits. I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty packed with families. Tickets are around $40 each for an adult. Be sure to buy tickets online beforehand because the ticket window line looked like a good 20 minutes long.My girlfriend loved the penguin and sea otter exhibits. They have daily feedings and we were able to catch the 3:00 penguin feeding and the 3:30 sea otter feeding.There is a parking garage near the entrance, but I think it was $5 for the whole day. There is street parking all around too, but it was pretty packed, and still costed almost $5 for half a day.We spent a little over 2 hours at the aquarium and afterwards walked down the street to visit all the souvenir stores. This could easily be a full day event for people interested, and they have a cafe indoors when you get hungry or thirsty."
1093,2017-06-14,5,I loved this aquarium! It was exactly what I remembered it was like when I was little girl. I did notice that there was only one sea turtle. I absolutely loved the Otters.
1094,2015-09-23,5,"The gold standard for aquariums. I'm a bit of a marine wild life geek (my Netflix list can attest) and anytime I'm visiting a city for more than a couple of days, I make it a point to visit the local aquarium. Having never visited Monterey and hearing all the hype for years, needless to say, my hopes were high and my expectations even higher once I planned my visit. Even so, this place still managed (excuse the obvious idiom) to blow them out of the water. Monterey Bay Aquarium is absolutely world-class.I really don't want to get into too much detail, because if you've never been, you should really experience it for yourself. Just know the aquarium is HUGE, but even more impressive is the quality of all the exhibits. From the Kelp Forest, to the Open Sea, and every exhibit in between, you'll be left in awe of all the wondrous creatures on display. My personal favorite is the Open Sea-- the display is gorgeously laid out. As you enter, above you is a school of sardines swimming in an O-shaped aquarium. Walking in further, you'll view a variety of beautiful and tranquil jellyfish displays. Finally, the coup de grace, you end the exhibit looking through an enormous pane of glass and on the other side are sharks, tuna, sea turtles, and schools of smaller fish. It's difficult to describe the display in words, it's just absolutely beautiful.Monterey Bay Aquarium succeeds in providing a fantastic and magical experience for all its patrons, both young and old. Whether you're 3 or 73, a visit will at times leave you speechless and will at times make you inquisitive. But the entire time you'll be appreciating the colors, sights, and sounds of creatures most of us don't usually see in our everyday lives. There is so much that we often take for granted. So come for a visit to see, learn, and experience a small, but important part of our world."
1095,2018-04-06,5,"My wife and I visited here several times while we were dating, This is the most amazing aquarium I have ever been in. One exhibit is just glass between you and the bay and you can watch the otters place and eat. We visited in 1988."
1096,2017-01-15,5,"One of my favorite things about this place is that the entire staff is trained to help you out and educate you in a friendly manner about the oceans and their environments. The volunteers are excited to be there, and you will undoubtedly learn more about that passion from your stay. The text alerts that you can sign up to get are guaranteed to keep you in the action for all the feedings so that you can see the animals in action. I went a second time within a year, and I was just as entertained and curious as the first. It is worth the ticket price to me."
1097,2015-06-04,5,"The drive is always fun! Last summer they had Jazz in the evenings. Check their website for seasonal activities and themes. Whenever in the area, we stay at the Monterey Bay Inn and walk to the Aquarium: montereybayinn.comMake sure to use Yelp for places to eat in the area."
1098,2018-04-06,5,We absolutely love it here! Last May we decided the membership was worth it and now we make frequent Day trips (2.5 hour drive from us) our 2.5 year old absolutely loves it! Fun and very educational. I highly recommend the membership if you plan on going more than once a year :)
1099,2018-04-06,5,So much to do here! So many things to sea  they have beautiful exhibits with lots of information and hands on exhibits too! They have some great areas for the kids to touch things and interact with the exhibits. They even have a kids play area with dress up costumes. The feeding programs are very fun and educational. Simply looking through the telescopes is fun too. Probably time to expand the aquarium...they have so much behind the scenes.
1100,2015-09-08,4,"I loved the aquarium very much and they had a wonderful variety of ocean life. Probably my favorite thing there was to watch the humongous fish tank. They had a two story tall tank with schools of fish and sharks and turtles together. On both floors in front of the tanks there are seats to relax and just watch the inhabitants swim around. The other attraction was the otters.  We got to watch them swim around and play and also feed. The jellyfish were very interesting to look at. They had so many kinds and a lot of them were put in dark rooms so that we could see how they glowed. There are definitely things to do for at least three hours, more if you've never been there before and want to try all the hands on exhibits. My gripes about the aquarium are that its way too crowded and it was very pricey.  There are lines to see individual tanks because you have to wait for people to move in order to get close and look. Even the otter tank was way too crowded to see much during feeding. They should probably build a better viewing platform. The price of a ticket was almost $40, when it seemed more like a $20-$25 value. I joked to my friend that the children's ticket should be more than the adult ticket."
1101,2017-07-02,5,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of my favorite places in the whole world! If you have never been to this fascinating place you should definitely go! They have such amazing wild life that I have never seen before! And each time I go I see something new! My favorite is the octopus and they have a pretty good place to eat inside there too
1102,2015-09-28,5,"I've grown quite fond of marine life since I moved to Monterey a few months ago and have learned so much. I've been itching to visit the aquarium since it's one of the most famous in the world and well, it's in my backyard.  I visited as a child and had fond memories of the kelp forest with thousands of fish roaming around the tanks. I was excited as an adult to experience it all over again! The entire museum is impressive with colorful and creative displays that look like floating art. My favorite exhibit featured jellies-I was mesmerized. I had no idea there were so many varieties. The tanks were lit in blue and the jellies elegantly floated along. The funniest exhibit was the penguin splash zone. Who knew these little guys were so feisty? In the middle of their platform sat a penguin egg and it appeared to be guarded by a group of penguins. A few times the penguins came close to fighting. It was also mating season as some of the penguins were touchy feely, haha! The only exhibit that needs some improvement is the sea otter area.  It's quite cramped and with the high volume of visitors the aquarium gets, it was difficult to see them in action. One last thing to note is that the aquarium gets extremely crowded.  I would suggest visiting during the week.  Weekends, holidays and the summer season seem to be the most crowded times to visit."
1103,2014-11-16,5,"I love fishhhhiiiiesssss and the sea in general. Any chance I have to visit an aquarium, you can surely count me in. Monterey Aquarium did not disappoint. Highlights: The jelly experience -Some of them were just mesmerizing to watch. Among my favorite were the moon jelly fish, the lion mane, umbrellas, and the blubbers...pretty cool to say the least. The educational portion (a exhibit dedicated to how we are hurting our env and interestingly, a bit on the California shark fin ban which I had no clue about prior to visiting the aquarium). The open sea exhibit will put you in awe (I saw some hammerhead sharks chasing a pool of fishes). It was just neat to watch. I could have sat for hours watching and observing. Finally, I thought the shark video to be okay. I thought this was my least favorite part of my visit. It was more about the research and how they go about conducting it versus a national geographic educational type of video. All in all, I was really happy I got to visit this aquarium. Parking is a bit tricky (you may have to park on street but we found a parking lot (10 dollars) not to far away from aquarium. Enjoy!"
1104,2015-07-19,5,"I love aquariums!! We came here during later hours to avoid crowds. There are students discounts :) The jelly fishes and the insanely HUGE tank is my favorite! Standing in the dark room gazing into the sea of marine animals can make you feel so small. The cold room filled with quiet voices as we stood in front of the glass window watching a school of anchovies swim in unison. It was so deep, dark, and lovely. There is a second floor with seats for the audience to watch the beautiful movements. I didn't see the second floor until we were already walking away. Fun fact: Jelly fishes only take the medusa form during their last year of life before death. Which is disheartening bc I've always wanted some as pets but they would have to be replaced annually. The glowing 4 chamber that appears in the mushroom head is their digestive system. The octopus room closed early. I snuck in, my bf didn't approved but came in after anyways. Followed by several other tourist who saw us ducked underneath the ropes and slipped through the curtains. There was nothing interesting there, idk if they put all the creatures away bc it was closed or it's commonly like that. There were more fake octopuses than real ones. We came during a special event so they gave out free wine tasting, free food samples and a band performance. Totally cool experience! I had a lot of fun :)"
1105,2015-08-30,5,Wow. What a wonderful place to learn and enjoy marine life. Be aware that this place gets crazy busy with a lot of kids. Parents seem to let their nasty ass kids run around with no control. Bring some rubber bands so you can snap the kids that get out of line. Lots of interactive exhibits and you can touch a wide variety of marine life. They have food court. Come early as the line to get in is insane.  We became members so now we can get in an hour earlier than general public and we are helping support the Aquarium.  I absolutely love this place.
1106,2018-04-03,5,"Worth the cost, beautiful and peaceful. Go on a weekday! The deep sea tank has mola mola as well as sea turtles. The touch tank is wonderful, tip: drum your fingers across the top to get the rays to come to you."
1107,2016-03-03,5,"We make a trip here every year with our now preschooler. This year is the first time our baby came along. We purchased the tickets online for faster and easier admission. It was not so crowded this Monday when we went, so we were able to enjoy it more. Our preschooler enjoyed more than the other years because he was able to name and recognized the animals. We love that we could bring our kids' lunch since they are picky eaters. The weather was warm enough for them to eat outside while enjoying the view of the ocean. The biggest hits for our kids were the play area upstairs and the splash zone. The areas were both fun and educational. Thumbs up for the padded floors!!The aquarium is very well maintain. All the bathroom were very clean (very important when you have a little one who needs diaper change). There are always volunteers around to help with direction and also to educate us about the different species we were looking at. As usual, the best time to come is on a weekday after 1 pm if you want to avoid the crowd. Dress in layers since it's Monterey.All in all, we had a great time as always and since both our kids loved it so much, we are thinking of purchasing a membership and taking the kids here more often this year!"
1108,2015-06-22,5,"I am so glad my husband and I were able to come back to Monterey and visit the aquarium! It seriously was one of the best we have ever visited. It wasn't crowded, the area was laid out in a way that helped with flow of traffic and of course, the exhibits themselves were just amazing. The employees were helpful, interested to share their info, and just overall great. We also went in to the cafe for a drink and everything was great there too. I cannot wait to come back and visit!!"
1109,2018-04-17,5,"Known as one of the Best Aquariums in the U.S., we are fortunate to have such an amazing resource in our small community.  The living kelp forest is amazing ... gives you the feeling of being deep below the surface.  Plan to spend the day!  And learn about our local marine habitats.  See the hourly shows and regional habitats.  And, enjoy every moment of your visit.  And, then come back again soon, when you have more time!  We have Julie Packard (as He ""P"" in HP!) to thank for supporting our Aquarium!"
1110,2015-01-08,5,"Last weekend was the first time I've been back since I came as a little kid. The day was great, all the exhibits were active, and we had a really fun time.Everyone's favorite exhibit seems to be the jellies. They're just so beautiful. The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach has some nice jellies, too, but Monterey has a larger selection and more viewing windows. Their special jelly exhibit was strange, with all the retro music and neon accoutrements, but it was still entertaining and probably better suited for the younger crowd.All of the octopuses were out, except for one, and although the wait for the sea otter feeding was long, hot, and uncomfortable with scores upon scores of people crowding in to catch a glimpse, they were still cute to watch. We also caught the albatross meet-and-greet, which was super cool. We grabbed a coffee (and a water for me) and sat in the cafe area. While there, we saw some sea lions, tons of birds, a few otters, and whales off the coast.Lastly, we took in a couple films, where we learned about otters and fish husbandry, and bought some souvenirs from the gift shop. I can't imagine coming to Monterey without stopping by for the aquarium. That would just seem wrong."
1111,2017-11-18,2,I can't fathom how this is considered nationally a great aquarium. I have been to many better such as Baltimore's. It is extremely over-priced and small.
1112,2017-07-19,4,"can't believe how beautiful this aquarium is. You get to see so much animals and different species. The sea otter feeding is adorable ! I also watched 4 of the auditorium shortmovies (ca 15min) which get presented by a volunteer/worker. They are clearly passionate about what they do and this transfers on to the public. Although 50$ seems expensive per person, you'll be able to spend the whole day there ! The variety of things to do is huge aswell. Just watching aquariums, attending the shortmovies, the touch pools and even swimming in there mini bay (this costs extra ofc). Also the admission goes to research and the renovation of the aquarium which is clearly visible! Very good maintained by staff. If i ever visit the Monterey again i will come back !"
1113,2018-02-25,3,We decided to take our two year old son on a Saturday before baby #2 arrives. We got there about 10:20 ( bought our tickets before so no wait ). I haven't been in maybe twelve years so I didn't remember anything. For some reason I thought there would be more than just fish. All fish. One sea otter tank and it was up top so everyone was surrounded by it. My whole family couldn't see anything. We waited but no one moved. The ocean area was even more packed. We tried to get out as fast as we could. For paying over $100 I would have liked to see something besides grey fish!!
1114,2017-12-06,5,I visited the aquarium last month and decided to try the restaurant for lunch.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the prices reasonable.  I ordered a green salad with clam chowder soup.  The salad and the dressing was so good that I asked the waiter what kind of cucumber was used as it was so crunchy.  He asked for me and said it was an English Cucumber.  The service was good and I had a table with a window view of the ocean.
1115,2013-01-04,5,"This place is awesome! I've been to Sea World (San Diego), The Aquarium of the Pacific (Long Beach), and Marineland (no longer open in Palos Verdes or somewhere close to that).  Comparing any of these places to the Monterey Bay Aquarium just isn't feasible. This is a phenomenal place to visit and everyone is quite knowledgeable about the sea creatures that they house. I also was pleased to see that they actually conduct classes for children right outside of the facility. This gives the children a chance to become more educated about sea animals and explore them in their natural habitat. This further enhances the children's understanding of concepts about sea animals because they are actually able to immerse themselves into their environment and discover what they may not have been able to comprehend from simply reading text books and looking at videos online. It's worth the flight, drive, bus ride, train ride, or however you plan to get to this facility because you can also take a stroll through Monterey and discover the quaint shops or share some lunch with your friends."
1116,2017-02-24,4,"The sea life was phenomenal. There was a rich variety of species, including sharks, sea turtles, octopi, jellyfish, schools of anchovy, otters, penguins, puffins, eels, tuna and sea horses. The aquarium also included paintings, animal sculptures, and interactive exhibits. There was also exhibits dedicated to very young children. I saw tunnels for kids to play with and touch pools. The aquarium also had a theme of protecting the ocean, it was very informational. The cafe food was also a lot better than I was expecting. However it was also very packed, especially for a weekday. I watched behind a solid wall of people and had to wrestle my way in for a view. For 100$ a couple that was a bit crowded."
1117,2018-04-15,5,The best place in town . Great for kids and adult . Amazing time there . Very highly recommended
1118,2018-04-15,4,Beautiful aquarium! The deep sea exhibit is so cool! It really feels like being out at sea! I love that the aquarium educates guests on climate issues and what we can do to help! It is a little expensive and smaller than I was expecting from other reviews. Still amazing! We had a great day!
1119,2018-02-07,5,Worth going on a weekday. Warning: strollers run amuck when the kids are not in school.
1120,2013-05-06,4,"a load of fun and worth the full package if you live in town.  We were iffy on purchasing the $250 package but we did since we have relatives who visit so often.  It was definitely a worthy investment.  We received 5 tickets total.  One for me, one for my husband, one for my baby, and 2 guest passes.  The perk to the guest passes is that they can go with or without us so we can have our neighbors go when they want as well without having to take them there!  :)Penguin feeding times are around 3pm and the kelp forrest feeding times are around 4pm. Prepare for the crowds but the kids will surely love it!!"
1121,2014-12-29,4,"This is probably one of the best aquariums I've been to. I haven't found one that has this much to see and do.This place is located on Cannery Row and therefore a touristy spot. I like the location because I can walk off all the carbs I had eating at one of the restaurants nearby.It's $39.95 right now for an adult ticket so I wouldn't recommend coming every year like Disneyland. They do not change the exhibits frequently enough to come back so often.What I do really like is all the animals and sea creatures I can see without putting on a scuba suit. I come to Monterey to be by the ocean, so learning about the different creatures is just fun for me.This place is really cool for kids and families. There is so much for the kids to see that I usually see kids tire out by the end. I myself always want to change careers and become a marine biologist by the end of the aquarium. I recommend if you're in the area!"
1122,2014-10-28,5,"I've been to Disney Land, and Disney World, and Sea World and Universal Studios. I've been to aquariums in Maryland, Georgia, Connecticut, Boston, Florida, none of these places can even hold a candle to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. A few things: Become members if you can. Discounts on the gift shop, tours, and you're donating to a really brilliant cause.Become members, arrive before the aquarium opens. Skip the line of angry people waiting for general admission. Take behind the scenes tours. Purchase them in advance on the website. The general behind the scenes and the otter tours are my favorite. Your mileage will vary but there is not an employee or volunteer in this place that will leave you disappointed. Arrive early, skip the line, run immediately to the lower observation deck. Grab a pair of binoculars and be prepared to have an awesome time. The deck is typically lined with tons of staff in the morning and they have already spotted all of the animals and will point you in the right direction. We spent a good hour on the deck asking questions and geeking out and we saw otters, sea lions, common dolphins and a gorgeous blue whale, and many many beautiful birds. Check out Tentacles exhibit. Be sure to attend as many feedings as you can. Arrive to feedings early for optimal viewing. Don't miss meeting the Albatros! This is easily one of my most favorite places on the planet. I'm a huge animal lover and I really like how Monterey uses positive training techniques, aims to release the animals that come into their care, supports education for young people and does really good things for our ocean!"
1123,2018-04-14,5,"$49 is a deal!!!! So much to see, great, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Can't wait to come back."
1124,2016-12-27,4,"I've only been to two aqauariums in my lifetime, and I'm not the guy to tell you why it's awesome, but i'll tell you - the aquarium is awesome and probably the best. Huge tanks and beautiful displays. Granted you're in a park of sorts, but it doesn't feel institutional by any means but feels welcoming and educational. Because of this, the aquarium can be expensive and very busy.Have a great time!"
1125,2015-03-06,5,"This aquarium always give my family a great experience. I can't ask for anything more. It seems like everytime I visit here there is something I missed the last time. I would like the price to be a little cheaper, but that's probably just because of my frooglness kicking in. But even at the current price, it's worth every penny. MBA, we'll see you soon."
1126,2018-03-13,5,I loved the Monterey Bay Aquarium because of the many interactive activities and it had something for everyone.The aquarium itself was extrondinary and very mind blowing.All of the animals were super beautiful and colorful and it was a very enlightening expirence for everyone.I think the Monterey Bay Aquarium Should be Aquarium of the year for its setup and its beauty.
1127,2018-01-12,4,"Parking sucked arse as we had to park uphill on side of road near some houses and then walk the rest of the way and the tickets are really pricey, but aside of those things, the aquarium is very welcoming and HUGE! My favorite exhibit was the Steampunk themed squid and cuttlefish gallery. They had some really cute and unique art installations and adorable cuttlefish. It was really interesting to see them up close and learn their body structure as well as the squids! They had some interactive displays and one such area with a faux restaurant educating you on over-fishing and what types of fish are endangered as well as environmentally better choices. They have a cool showing where they feed larger fish such as a sun fish and later if you are lucky, which I WAS-- you can see a swarm of sardines come up from the bottom of the tank and DANCE the DANCE OF LIFE! The host of the show was really informative and go over their spiffy app that let's you know which fish to buy for consumption. Honestly there is so much to see, it's a great way to spend the entire day. There is a restaurant that overlooks open water. You can see the seals from afar and cute sea otters. You are able to re-enter with a stamp!"
1128,2014-10-10,2,"First mistake was coming here on a Saturday. The place was loaded with people, and misbehaved children. Right away I get ran over by a stroller. No sorry, or excuse me. We start walking around to check out the place, and there is screaming children everywhere. I've never in my life felt the overwhelming urge to run to the nearest clinic for a stock pile of birth control. We went to every single exhibit. Not one of them impressed me. The place was old. I thought the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay blew this place out of the water (no pun intended). What a waste of $40. I should've gone kayaking."
1129,2016-11-25,5,"This place is amazing!  It's huge, with beautiful ocean exhibits, touch pools that also have kids' heights in mind, a place place for children.  It's interactive and educational."
1130,2018-02-28,3,Very crowded and they didn't have as much sea life as I thought they would.
1131,2013-03-09,5,"This review is more for the Feeding Frenzy Tour because Monterey Bay Aquarium is an easy 5 star Aquarium. Anyone who gives it less must of had a bad customer service experience because coming from someone who has been to Aquariums throughout the US this is one of the best by far.  I have a feeling most people either don't know about the special behind the scene tours the Aquarium offers so I thought this review would be helpful to fans as big as me of this place. First, the Feeding Frenzy tour allows guests to observe some of the exhibits before it even opens to the public. it was nice to quietly observe the otters before the thousands of visitors arrived. We were allowed to peacefully observe a private morning feeding. The tour guides did a great job of explaining what thoughts went into designing each exhibit, what fish were in tank, and what fish ate whatever it was we were feeding them. We were allowed to drop food into several different tanks and threw everything in them from whole squid, pellets, fish chunks, and other fish products. It was a great hands on experience and encourage everyone to try it once."
1132,2014-12-08,3,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium was spread out with lots of space. There was lots of room to walk around, and it had some very good special exhibits at the time I went to visit, like the Jellies and Tentacles. They do have a magnificent Kelp Forest, Monterey Bay Habitats and the eye catching Open Sea tank that kept you in awe, but to me I wasn't so excited with the other exhibits.  The aquarium is clean and animals are all extremely well kept and healthy which is a big plus.  I like that they promote their programs, but I was expecting something so great with lots, and lots of exhibits, but I didn't get it here. People that I know told me that this aquarium was so big and gorgeous and had lots to see.  I didn't find it as impressive as my friends and family described it. Perhaps it was the long trip here that maybe diminished my experience a bit. I did see an otter and the penguins but when I went to look at the seahorse, there were only several all in tank with other sea life and not even that many lion fishes. The aquarium tends to be a bit juvenile and geared more for children then adults.  There is a main gift shop downstairs and a smaller one upstairs.  There is an outside area where you can see beautiful Monterey Bay.  A cafeteria was also situated upstairs.  There are also water bottle stations, where you can get your bottle of water refilled.  There was also a theater where you can watch a film.  At the time, I believe it was about otters.They do important work here for the animals, sea life and conversation so that is another big plus."
1133,2015-01-29,5,"I have to start off by saying that I had never visit an aquarium (I have 3 siblings so my parents couldn't afford to take us all out.)I took my daughters to the aquarium on a Sunday, and It was just an amazing experience for all of us.We saw every type of aquatic species, my older daughter was asking me through out the whole time which fishes I usually get when I go fishing.I showed her the salmon fishes and told her my first experience getting a salmon fish, she was so interested.We saw all the jellyfishes, and she started telling me that she knew those were poisonous.We saw a bird (I forgot the name)  similar to the seagulls but with the difference that, this bird was super smart, and can fly for up to 3 days, the bird locks its wings and can even sleep on the air.My younger daughter was more interested in the sea otters, specially on the videos they play there showing how they feed them when their babies, brush them and how they catch and break their food when their older.When we saw the sea otters my daughter's were just standing there for like 30 mins just looking at them.Also they have an area where it shows what happens to the trash we leave behind!I will recommend the aquarium to anyone who likes the ocean it's incredible how many different things you can find there."
1134,2018-02-25,4,"I love this place and the experience is beautiful and fun. They have a lot of interaction experiences for kids which is great being I have 3 of them. My only gripe is the prices are ridiculous. @ $50 per ticket it should include something extra to make it feel worth it. The most time we usually spend is 4 hours before we get bored. I just wish that is was a little more affordable and we would probably come more than once per year. Overall I definite recommend coming here to experience the beautiful views, ocean life and positive vibe."
1135,2018-06-29,5,"Amazing aquarium. Fascinating exhibits for both kids and adults. Great views of the bay from the upper deck. Minor point -- I wish they would offer AAA discount onsite, but you have to buy AAA discounted tickets fromAAA."
1136,2012-09-20,5,"Am I on acid?  No I am standing in front of one of the Jelly Fish exhibits at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Good, because I thought I was seeing colors and those weird looking Seahorses I just saw were pretty trippy as well.  Who knew they had so many weird sizes and shapes?  Are you sure I am not on acid?  I think I just saw some dragons as well?  Oh!  Those were Sea Dragons and I was not hallucinating.  What about those flashing, ever changing, metallic shapes?  Oooohhh!  Those were schools of sardines and they really exist as well.What about that giant, weird, prehistoric looking thing at the bottom of one of the larger tanks that kept giving me the evil eye?  I think it may have been trying to cast spells on me.  Maybe not???   Even though I don't remember the name of it, I guess it was just your normal giant, weird, prehistoric looking fish.That place was awesome!!!  I sure hope I have some flashbacks."
1137,2018-03-20,4,"As a local, I wasn't too into spending the money to go to this local attraction. But it is really well worth it. The exhibits and opportunity for interaction with species and human teachers is great. Don't underestimate how much someone will like this place just because you were raised around the ocean!"
1138,2014-09-18,5,"This is a must see attraction if you're in Monterey! It's very impressive and I live in Hawaii surrounded by water and sea life so that says something! Give yourself at least 1.5 hours to go through the entire aquarium. Bring comfortable walking shoes! We were able to see all the sections in the aquarium and some feedings as well. Going when they open helps. If you purchase tickets online then you can walk right in but if not, you will stand in line for admission. When you go in, the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. They really add to the whole experience of being there. One of my favorite and memorable parts of the aquarium was the Jellyfish Farm. I got a ton of great photos there! It was so beautiful and educational! This was my first time in Monterey and this attraction was the highlight of my stay there. I recommend it and it's worth every penny for admission! Thank you bb for taking me!"
1139,2018-04-04,4,Fun as always went with my 9 year old we enjoyed it but it was just sooo crowded also spring break to it figures. Always a pleasure. I recommend this especially for people with younger kids because they do have designated ares geared toward them.
1140,2017-09-10,5,Was super crowded over Labor Day weekend but we had a great time. Truly an informative and fun stop for families on vacation.
1141,2018-04-04,5,"What a fantastic aquarium! A must-see when in Monterey! The exhibits were clean and the animals well cared for. The staff are very informative, and the sit down shows were fun and educational. It is an amazing experience."
1142,2015-07-03,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a lovely little aquarium, perfect for all ages. The otters are just the cutest, I want to squeeze their little furry whiskered faces. The bat rays in the touch pool are really cool, as is the starfish and other sealift. The many tanks of eels, squid, sea horses and varieties of fish and other marine life, are quite beautiful. There are a few tanks of smaller sharks and seaweed kelp forests. We saw the puffins and all ""oooohhhed"" or ""awwwwwwed"" super cute. The coolest attraction for us was the hour and a half scuba lessons in the private cove for kids 8-13. I thought it somewhat reasonable for $90 per person, the scuba instructors outfit and show basic scuba hand signals and scuba safety, then they go down to the cove and with an instructor swim around looking at sea life such as sea snails and starfish. I never got to do anything that cool when I was a kid!!! The aquarium is not huge, so it's a good 2-3 hour place to look at mother nature's finest creations, and there's beautiful ocean views and convenient, touristy shops and restaurants nearby."
1143,2017-02-19,5,"We took our 18 month old here and it was by far the best time she's had. She loved exploring everything. Their is and area that is perfect for babies and toddlers. My little one got to play with water, Shapes, and even got to jump on a soft Matt  that felt like waves when you would sit on it. Theirs another area for kids a bit bigger. Theirs slides places to climb and even some sea horses that would rock back and forth. Their is an outdoor area that is great for taking a break from the inside. Their is lots of seating. And it's a beautiful view of the ocean. Many kids run around and meet other little ones. It was a really good place to let my little girl meet other babies. A must is going into the aquarium gift shops. Amazingly they are not over priced. Theirs lots of neat puzzles books stuffed animals and more. We will definitely be coming back."
1144,2018-02-18,2,"The aquarium was just ok... I was expecting it to be something spectacular for the price you pay and all the hype it has. We literally paid 140 dollars for 2 adults and 2 kids. I have been to aquariums you pay 20 bucks a person and there was more to offer than this. Yes the views of the ocean are nice and the kids activities are cool, but there was really no WOW factor. We thought there would be sharks or something cool...nothing... I guess I can say we have been there and seen it, I will probably never come back... especially for all that money..."
1145,2017-09-20,5,"Not cheap- $50 an entry, but that is to be expected. Locals can get a membership for about $100. Still the place was pretty cool. They turned the old canary into a aquarium. The otters were my favorite and they have 2 eating options within the place. Wanna leave for a bit, no big deal, just get a stamp on the way out."
1146,2018-02-17,5,"Excellent. Buy a membership so you can return often. The views are magnificent all the animals here are real, except the whales. Have fun!"
1147,2015-04-02,4,"The line was insane getting in and it's a bit pricey, my student discount only saved me a few bucks. The ticket gives you entrance for two consecutive days. It was incredibly crowded (on a Tuesday) and we were able to see everything in two hours so there wasn't much sense in going back a second day. BUT it was worth it because the tanks were amazing. It was like you were underwater looking up from a kelp forest. There's even a small spot to actually pet some of the water dwelling animals. Overall, it was a great experience."
1148,2016-07-06,2,"Folks on Yelp that say that MB Aquarium is one of the best in the word clearly not have been to very many aquariums in the US.  I have no doubt that the aquarium staff works wonders in the realm of conservation and they are wonderful at educating the public on sustainable seafood consumption.  But as a transient living temporarily in the area, I get the same reaction from family coming to visit: it's just OK.  I won't go to the aquarium again while I'm here if I can help it.  Two things that would earn the aquarium 5 stars from me:  1.) Lower your ticket prices to reflect both the size of your aquarium and the never-changing exhibits.  You can bet this won't happen though, Monterey businesses/residents do love their inflated prices and cash inflow.  2.) Switch things up a little bit.  Newport (Greater Cincinnati) Aquarium has varying exhibits all the time.  In the 2 years I've lived here, I can still recite each one of the exhibits.  2 jellyfish displays, the kelp forest, the Penguins, the small wave pool, the touch pool, the otters, the deep ocean, and the shipwreck.  Maybe a handful of extra small tanks.  I receive the same perplexed opinion from family visitors.  Was that it??  Put in a temporary premium exhibit maybe?  Something guys, come on.  An additional aside, which doesn't really reflect the quality of the aquarium I suppose, I have numerous 20,30-something friends of mine that have been turned down for volunteer positions at the aquarium (including a recent marine biology graduate) in favor of the throngs of AARP-aged folks that the aquarium currently enlists.  A young breath of fresh air would do this aquarium and town well.  Get over yourselves.In the meantime, save your money and visit the San Diego zoo.  The zoo (and city) are much more worth your time and money."
1149,2017-03-05,4,Have been to may aquariums.This one is one of the best.The Seahorse display alone is enormous.Kids and adults of all ages should be thoroughly amused here.
1150,2012-09-23,5,"Right up there with astronomy, sea life has been an endless source of fascination to me.  And it seems the majority of my fellow humans on this Earth share this interest as well.  Ever since I was a child having a 10 gallon aquarium with tropical fish always allowed me to watch the behavior of underwater life.  So needless to say, whenever there is an opportunity to visit a major public aquarium, I would jump at the chance! It's been years since I last visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I had gone with my parents and friends in the past.  Each time it would be new and different, so it was never boring.  My recent visit did not disappoint!  My boyfriend Joe K. and I had an awesome time touring all the displays and mesmerized by the varieties of sea life behind all the glass enclosures representing the fish's habitats of the bay where the aquarium is located right at its edge.  From the tiniest of crustaceans to the largest of sharks, most local marine life is represented here either in person or by illustration.  Descriptions of each aquatic specimen are briefly outlined along with their life cycles, mating habits, food sources and what areas of the bay they can be found.  Not only is the Monterey Bay Aquarium a fun place to view an alien world most often not seen by us land lubbers, but it is an important place that provides education and awareness about who we share this planet with, including the fragility of our ecosystems.  The beautiful, scenic town of Monterey has a lot going for it, and the aquarium tops this list!youtube.com/watch?v=psCG…"
1151,2016-07-21,4,Really fun place. A lot of memories. Multiple field trips were taken here.My favorite part is the place where it looks like a restaurant. I tells your how endangered most of the animals are. But honestly it makes me hungry. hahaAnyway it is expensive. I know there is a discount for locals. But never really know when that is.All in all it is still a really great place to go.
1152,2017-03-04,3,Spend some of the after noon at the  aquarium only problem was way to pack ac was not even on an u could barley see anything since there was so many people huge lines but sides that fish An the tanks were pretty cool but 50 bucks person for no ac An huge lines I'll pass next time
1153,2017-08-16,4,"The Aquarium is amazing, you can easily spend all day wandering and looking. We were there on a Monday in mid-August when *most* kids were back in school. (We had our four kids with us as we have a later start - kids range in age from 11 to newborn). The cost - as of August 2017 it was $50 for adults and $40 for kids aged 3-12. Fortunately for us our two year old and infant were free. I highly recommend purchasing tickets ahead of time so you can skip the purchase line. Additionally, we bought online through AAA and saved $5 a ticket.  Parking - this is a situation. The aquarium itself doesn't have parking so you have to either meter or find a lot. We found an all day lot on Irving (about two or three blocks away) that was $10 but had no in and out privileges. Also, we have a large SUV and were relieved to find generous spaces (many, many were compact) but we were able to comfortably park and unload the mess that is our lives - strollers, baby bags, infant carriers, purses, backpacks, etc. Cafe - there is a sit down restaurant but it was about an hour wait so we opted for the cafeteria style cafe instead. I recommend sending someone from your party to grab a spot at a table. You'll probably be sharing and they are super long tables. There are high chairs available as well. Be aware you pay out the nose for the food!!  We paid over $80 to feed five people. (Personal pizza that was shared between an eight and two year old, make your own salad, sandwich, soup in a bread bowl, two fountain drinks, two bottled lemonades, three cookies, and a bag of chips). Note on the make your own salad - you merely get to pick three toppings, this isn't a ""load up your plate"" kind of situation. The selection was decent though, there were plenty of other things to pick. Also, if this matters to you, they had no ""regular"" soft drinks (Coke, Pepsi, etc.) It was all crafted soft drinks - either bottled or at the fountain. There was iced tea though. But if you have a picky kid this is problematic.  Also, you can buy a refillable aluminum water bottle which can be worth it because they have those bottle refilling stations by the water fountains. Just a thought. Play area - there is a large play area for the kids to run amuck and thank God for it. Between that and the ""Splash Zone"" we were able to get some energy run off of our two year old.Crowds - this was actually not too bad for us since school was back in session. There is an app for he Aquarium and you can have reminders about feeding times and shows or exhibits. That helps you avoid the crowds by getting there early.  We were able to negotiate with our stroller fairly easily. There were also stroller parking areas where strollers couldn't go. Our whole family enjoyed the experience."
1154,2016-08-01,5,"Amazing! Decided to take a day trip to Monterey to visit the aquarium and it was well worth the 3 hour drive! Parking can be an issue, but if you park downtown, they have s free trolley that will take you to Fishermans Wharf and the Aquarium. Trolleys run every 10-15min. We purchased our tickets online which helped us get in faster. The line to purchase tickets were very long. Once we entered, we were greeted by staff members holding up glass containers filled with jelly fish and hermit crabs. The layout of the aquarium is very easy to navigate through. My favorite exhibit would have to be the jelly fish. Soothing music in a dimly lit room as gaze into the light the illuminates from the jelly fish. It was spectacular. Even my son, who is only 5 months old, was captivated by it.You are allowed to exit and re-enter the aquarium as long as you have your hand stamped at the exit. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance of the aquarium. Btw, there's like 3 or 4 poke stops and a poke gym in the aquarium. I had to repeatedly tell my nephews to quit checking their phones, but it was hard to do that when almost every kid around us was doing the same thing. But if you have kids who are reluctant to go to an aquarium, tell them about the poke stops!"
1155,2017-02-10,5,"This place is amazing. If you are in the area, it is a ""must do"" activity. My daughter and I had a great time and saw some pretty awesome sea life."
1156,2018-03-29,5,We love the aquarium and visit it each time we come here. They are always updating different areas and adding new features. Always a great time here!
1157,2018-02-27,5,What a experience for kids & parents alike!! The jellyfish exhibit was a favorite & so informative. Kids were able to have a hands on experience. Highly recommend.
1158,2017-06-06,4,"How is it that I've never written a review for MBA?! Ok, so growing up, I came here a couple of times in my teens, and it was always eye-opening and a learning experience for me b/c I'm easily amused and I love to learn about the natural world, you know, all the fun tidbits about this sea creature or that ecosystem. As for hubby and me, before we had kids, we came once and it was good too, but it was before they did a whole bunch of revamping so we didn't get to see all the changes. Most recently though, we brought our two kiddos and were joined by my bro and his two kids last winter for a little day trip here. It was a wonderful experience as it was a special day and they had all kinds of stations and activities for the kids to explore and learn. The weather was terrible that weekend as we were driving down, it was like the weekend of the storm of the year, but that Monday at MBA was beautiful. The sun came out and it warmed up and we were even able to picnic right outside at one of the ""balcony"" areas. We hit as many of the different featured areas of the museums as possible and the kids all had such a great time looking at all the sea creatures on exhibit and interacting with some of them in designated touch-pools, or playing in the indoor play structures. We definitely plan to come back again!"
1159,2017-03-19,5,"One of my favorite places ever. Pretty expensive, but worth it. So many awesome exhibits. Weekends are crazy packed so for the best experience come on a weekday! The shows are always packed too so plan accordingly. The feedings and shows are well worth it."
1160,2016-02-16,5,"Perfect half day visit (3-4 hour depending on speed) for all ages. I paid $35 for a student ticket (must bring ID). Located around a super touristy area and right next to Monterey's bustling fisherman's wharf. At the end of the famous Cannery Row oceanside.The aquarium is extremely child friendly while still exciting for the older crowd. The dozens of saltwater exhibits offers a glimpse of unseen subsurface marine life. Includes huge deep sea fish; Mahi Mahi, Bluefin Tuna, hammerhead shark and many many others. There is also an aviary and penguins! My personal favorite was the playful sea otter feedings. Incredibly cute. They are scheduled at specified times of the day. One could easily spend a whole day here. The oceanside part of the aquarium opens up and offers an amazing view of Monterey Bay. Food and drinks are not allowed to be consumed inside but should not be a problem because there is a cafeteria. Super knowledgable staff and very approachable. I mean they probably have one of the most satisfying jobs ever. Admission tickets and proceeds help the Aquariums's conservation efforts so go ahead and feel like a conservationist when purchasing from their gift shops although their selection of shirts is mediocre."
1161,2016-08-23,4,"I've been wanting to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium for years so I was stoked to finally cross it off my bucket list this weekend. Tickets are on the pricier end which is why it took me so long to come LOL. Anyway, the aquarium itself is pretty big. There's a lot to see and they even have a children's section which is neat! There were however a few things that made our trip less enjoyable. First, if you go on a weekend like we did, it's hard to enjoy looking at all the animals with 472831910 people also looking at them and crowding your view with their cameras/phones so I think there should be lines so that everyone gets a minute or so to look, take pictures/videos of whatever it is WITHOUT ruining someone else's experience. Sure everyone hates lines but what's worse than paying $80 to look at someone else in front of you recording 10 minute videos? Another thing I think would have made the aquarium better, was to have more touch pools. They had the bat sting ray which no one was able to reach, and kelp which was really lame. The gift shops are also pretty lame as I didn't see one thing that I liked. We were in and out in about an hour which is unfortunate because I thought it'd take way longer :("
1162,2018-09-25,5,The aquarium was great. I spent all day there and saw all the informational programs. I highly recommend the aquarium to any one who is interested in marine life. I particularly enjoyed the open ocean exhibit and the octopus.
1163,2014-08-08,5,"I first came here in 2007 when they were renovating a few areas to improve and prepare for their new resident animals, the poppins and the penguins so that got me really excited to come back and look forward to. I didn't really remember much during this time except it was crowded.Fast Forward to 2012, I finally came back with a friend and we took our time exploring this place. I knew we had to save the penguins for last as they are my purpose to see lol We first started with the big tank of fish with sharks, big Magikarp looking fishes, and big Goldeen looking fishes.. Yeah, I call them after Pokemons since that's how I would describe them in my memory haha Oh there's this other big tank where you can sit and watch the fishes - it had sharks, turtles, big tunas, and this weird looking fish that I forgot what's it called but it was a weird, unique looking fish. They have this area where you can poke the starfish or even pick it up and you can pet the stingrays just gently so they won't get all mad or scared. Also, you should see the Jelly fish exhibit because they are so pretty in photos. Lastly, PENGUINS! PENGUINS! PENGUINS! Oh the cuteness of this animal is just something I really enjoy watching. They like to show off their swimming abilities, get out of the water and take a dump in front of people - it's not like they care anyways. haha. We were just in time for Penguin feeding session of the day so we sat down and watched it. They also do Q and A while feeding them so any questions about the cute penguins will be answered by the experts. During Q and A feeding time, there was this penguin named Pringles who kept stealing pebbles from other nest to make his own nest. It as hilarious watching it happen in the background and everyone had a good laugh about it.Overall, my second experience was very pleasant since I got to see the penguins :) We've spent about 3-4 hours exploring this museum and I must say it is worth every penny you've paid!"
1164,2014-08-18,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is absolutely the most amazing aquarium I've ever been to! Located at the end of Cannery row,  a trip to this unique aquarium is worth the time if you are ever in the area. The Open Sea exhibit was a jaw-dropping experience.  A HUGE tank full of so many varieties of fish: great white shark, hammerhead, even exotic fish like the sun fish can be found here!  And don't miss the school of anchovies swimming against endless current...It's mesmerizing!  My other favorite was the jellyfish exhibit - coolest variety of jellyfish I've ever seen.  Looking at their tentacles glowing - makes you believe in magic ;)The Monterey Bay Aquarium is not that big, I spent about 2 hours combing through all their exhibits. Price is also a little high ($40 a person), but the aquarium is excellent and worth every penny."
1165,2017-08-01,5,"The Monterey bay aquarium is an awesome attraction to admire and spend time in. If you do go, you have to check out their awesome otters. Be sure to ask for feeding times because those can always get exciting. They've got a verity of shops and stores too. We spent a good 2 and a half hours having a great time here!"
1166,2015-07-04,4,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is the centre-piece of Monterey's regenerated waterfront area and an incredibly popular destination for families. As aquariums go, it certainly is not the largest in terms of size or the number of species, but it does have some specific exhibits which are really exceptional.The most popular exhibits are the two large main tanks, both two storeys high. One of these includes a kelp forest with otters, which is probably the most popular exhibit - the otters seem comfortable with people and come right up to the glass (who is watching who?). The other large tank contains 1.2 million litres of water and has one of the largest single-pane glass windows in the world, containing Pacific Ocean shoals of fish, including tuna and sharks.Perhaps the best exhibits are the jellyfish tanks: they are beautifully presented and lit, and very calming to watch. Outside, there is an ocean pool where children can snorkel with expert tuition and a viewing platform for watching local ocean-going bird life, with binoculars to borrow. The staff and volunteers here were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.There are also exhibits covering molluscs (octopuses, nautiluses, squid and cuttlefish), marine conservation and shore life, as well as petting tanks with rays. The aquarium has a cafe and (inevitably) lots of shopping opportunities.Entry for adults is $29.95 - not cheap but about par for the course for such an attraction."
1167,2016-07-31,3,"It was a beautiful aquarium. We gave it 3 stars because it was $160 for two adults and two children. It was so crowded that we were unable to see 95% of the exhibits. I know it's summertime, but it was extreme. We left after 1-1/2 hours because we didn't see the point of continuing on. I would love to go back. If they had scheduled tours it would be worth the money. The two great things about it were the jellyfish exhibit and volunteers."
1168,2017-12-06,4,"Came here after eating at the Old Monterey Cafe during our vacation on August 12. The line was very long as we got here just right at opening but it wasn't a long wait. Mind you this aquarium is VERY big! There's so much to take in while here. My favorite exhibits by far are the otter exhibit and the jellyfish exhibit. All the animals I saw even looked happy and healthy. There's even a playground area for your children, lots of gift shops and a cafe inside as well. My only complaint was the amount of virtual exhibits. I understand why they were used, and it was cool how you could interact with them but if I am in an aquarium I want to see more living animals than virtual screens. In a world where everything is touch screen I don't want there to be more of those taking ocer the aquarium when I came to see animals. Other than that we really truly enjoyed it, just be aware when you go on the weekends it will be crowded. I definitely want to come back."
1169,2017-03-08,3,"Crowded, crowded, crowded. This aquarium may be a victim of its own success. Yes, the exhibits were impressive, and included a lot to offer adults and special features for children. However, when we were there (mid day Saturday in March) it was so crowded that we could barely move in the (otherwise great) jellyfish exhibit--it seems like everybody else wanted to see the same things we had heard about. Our difficulty walking through this area was compounded by the lack of adequate light in the human area (the jellyfish tanks were well illuminated of course). We found parking satisfactory (flat seven dollars for the day in the municipal, east garage) so we were able to walk around in the rest of Monterey, Cannery Row, and also take the free trolley from the aquarium back to downtown."
1170,2016-08-05,2,"Where do I begin!! I'm thoroughly disappointed with this aquarium. After getting into reef-keeping and hearing good things about Monterey Bay Aquarium, I urged to go here the next time I was in the Bay area. Jump back to last weekend when a buddy and I made a spontaneous trip to SF for the weekend to spend some time with our families. Because we road tripped up, we decided to spend our Sunday afternoon in Monterey on the drive back to LA. My sister had guest passes for the aquarium, so we didn't have to pay, YAY! Luckily, meter street parking was a breeze as well. The overall outlook of the aquarium is really just meh. Nothing really jumped out to me as out of the ordinary. I probably have more interest watching Youtube videos on deep sea adventures... But I guess the part that was really disappointing was that since they already don't have a freshwater section, I expected the aquarium to be filled with vast deep sea life exhibits. I felt like there was a huge lack of effort and care to put the ""wow"" into their tanks. A huge majority of their tanks were stocked with fake boujie looking coral and just whatever fish/invertebrate that tank was showcasing. The main decoration of their huge, and small tanks, were almost all seaweed... how freaking boring. I guess coming from California Academy of Sciences from the previous day really put a huge expectation on this place. Then again, maybe this place is leaned more towards children's' learning than as an exhibit."
1171,2015-06-04,5,"This was one amazing aquarium! From the sea otters to the jelly fish, the Sharks to the crabs, it made for an awesome day. It is definitely geared toward kids but my husband and I still had a wonderful time. Make sure to get outside and look through the binoculars!! We saw sea otters and sea lions! It was the best part of the day!!"
1172,2015-06-23,5,"If you live in Monterey, getting a membership here is a must.  We did the family package to have a couple of passes for friends and family from out of town and it's totally paid for itself in the first few months.  Wonderful experience for kids and adults alike and we will continue to stroll through here with our little one during the week - they open an hour early for members to take a stroll and beat the crowds."
1173,2018-01-20,4,"A great place for toddlers and kids. Can get really crowded during weekends, and holidays. Parking is a pain."
1174,2017-06-24,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is world famous for it's high quality exhibits and large cavernous facility. You could literally spend hours here and not absorb all that MBA has to offer. Plenty of giant aquariums filled with ocean life give you a real sense of what's really going on out there under the surface of the big blue pond. The jellyfish area is totally mesmerizing. The lighting and the movement of the jellyfish is otherworldly and does not disappoint. My son love sharks, so we usually make a beeline to the giant open ocean exhibit to watch some hammerheads gracefully swim by as schools of smaller fish circle below. Truly impressive. Additionally, the volunteer staff and the area where kids can actually touch the creatures is fantastic. What kid wouldn't want to do that? Kudos!At every feature, you can expect to get a thoughtful education on the habitat, habits, and diet of the creatures you are viewing. This place is definitely a top notch and world class facility of its kind. On the down side, expect to pay an arm and a leg to get in, which is a shame because the cost has become so prohibitive that I'm sure some families don't give it a try. I think I could purchase a week's worth of groceries for my 3 person family for the same cost of entry into the MBA for the same 3 people. Also, parking can be a challenge during the more crowded times, so get ready to circle around a bit, oh, and of course, that will cost you as well. Lastly, we have been coming to Monterey for the last few years, so we visit the aquarium about once per year and not much really changes. The house we rent comes with a couple of free passes, so we'll stop in for a visit, but if we were paying full price, I'm not sure we would go every year. Oh, and one other minor thorn... expect to be constantly hit over the head with an environmental message as you tour the aquarium. I'm sure that's to be expected, but some may not appreciate it. Keep in mind that the Aquarium is one feature of the Monterey area, but there's quite a bit of other attractions which make a visit worthwhile."
1175,2015-10-31,5,"Amazing. The best. Highly recommended. Jellies, octopus, and sea otters are highlights.Get tickets from a local hotel for 2-day pass for the price of 1-day."
1176,2016-11-15,4,"So more of a 4.5 stars.This place was easy to find thanx to all the signs pointing the way.Some of the pros is that this is huge. Plus there's a couple touch pool interactives that is amusing and interesting to learn. Talk with the volunteers at the touch pools and they will be more than happy to help out. There a few kid zones that are good for the younger kids to learn about sea life and habitats. The cons I can't escape. The first one is parking. You can either meter park it and spend quite a bit as the aquarium is definitely not a quick walk through. There are two paid lots, we parked at the end of the Cannary Row and got lucky with $10 all day. Both my husband and I agreed that some parts of it are like an LSD High. There are trippy moments in the darker exhibits. We have no clue what's it like to be high, but got a good dose of it today. My equilibrium was off a good half hour to 45 minutes. I wish there weren't so many fish eye glass displays and sardines swimming in a circle.But would I recommend this place? Definitely. It's worth the price. And a tip is if you stay at the Hyatt Monterey, you can snag a 2 for 1 tickets good for 2 days. Which is what we did. So we have tickets for tomorrow if we wanted to go again."
1177,2016-08-01,3,The aquarium is pretty nice overall but definitely not for the price. They have great exhibits and everything and the food is pretty good also. But it wouldn't be a thing I would want to come to every time we're in town
1178,2016-09-05,4,"I am disappointed that the ticket price went up but that's progress, right?Never a dull moment at MBA, the exhibits are always changing, even daily.I try to visit the aquarium every few weeks just because we are local. Membership has perks. Events, access, Great food too, the restaurant is $$$ but delicious. I only go maybe once a year to eat there for that reason, come on, your going to charge $$$ for tickets and $$$ for for eats too. It's like going to a theme park more than a museum or aquarium."
1179,2015-06-07,5,"Amazing place!  The Aquarium of the Pacific looks like an amateur's fish tank compared to this spot.  The displays were absolutely jaw dropping.  Wish we could come by on a regular basis, but just a bit too far away...One thing is for sure.  Its presence is fueling the whole peninsula's business.  You'll see plenty of what look like abandoned lots right next door, but all the hotels and restaurants in the area have the aquarium to thank."
1180,2015-11-26,5,"Had so much fun here, got there early on thanksgiving and about an hour in, it got pretty crowded. Thankfully my family and i had seen most of everything already. We got to see a viewing in the little theatre room about great white sharks. There's a children's play area in the back where they can play with water and jump around etc. There's petting stations to touch sea animals. Can also touch sting rays. I thought there would be whales and dolphins and big sharks lol but sadly no.There's a cafe which got super crowded and you're not allowed to take food out. Staff were pretty helpful and there seemed to be some all over the place that explain the animals. Was all nice and would love to come back again."
1181,2017-05-07,2,"Unbeknownst to me, we went on dia se Los ninos, more like dia de Los muertos. The docent told us it was their busiest day of the year. I have been here in the past and the place was much better. On this day, however, I felt like I was in tijuana. It was free for kids under 12 and they were having live Mexican music, so there were several thousand kids running around with maybe a hundered or two adults. The kids were banging on the glass walls and scaring the animals and breaking every aquarium rule but none of the employees seemed to care. I couldn't see any of the exhibits because of the mass of people blocking the view and we ended up leaving after half an hour. Even though the ticket price was 50 bucks. This place has jumped the shark."
1182,2019-03-15,5,this is my fav place to take my friends outside of monterey. it's very educational and I love the volunteers. they are always eager to talk to you and inform you. thanks to all of the hard workers here.
1183,2015-11-21,5,"The people who say it's expensive need to get over themselves.  The tickets are $40, how is that expensive.  These are the same people who will spend $200 on a 3 hour football game.  I will gladly pay them over and over again because I know my ticket is not only going to employees paychecks, but research and keeping up the health of these wonderful animals.  Did you know that it costs the aquarium $15,000 a year to feed ONE sea otter for 1 year, and it costs them over $250,000 per day just to keep the electricity on and the filters going not to mention feeding and maintenance.Below is a link an in depth look into the functions of the aquarium so you can see just how much money it costs them.  I will gladly pay over and over again to visit.  It never gets old!!!   storage.montereybayaquar…"
1184,2017-03-26,5,"We all loved it. Very friendly, nice, and helpful staff.  We will definitely go back . Can't wait until my son gets a little bit older to bring him, because when we went he was small. It's worth your money."
1185,2014-12-16,4,"This past Sunday was the first time I visited with my wife and our friends but, I used to visit the aquarium frequently as a child. It was awesome! I think they have more exhibits here now than they did when I was a kid. The jellyfish were the best part...so graceful.I would definitely go back during the week next time as it was very crowded over the weekend. Also, I am giving the Monterey Bay Aquarium 4 out of 5 stars only because admission is $40 per person...YIKES!"
1186,2013-05-27,4,"Sea dragons and penguins and jellies. Oh my!In a short span of time you'll forget about the pricey entry-ticket and noisey children because you'll be transfixed by the close encounters with nature's underwater wonders. At any age, the Monterey Aquarium will have you oohing and ahhing your way around marine exhibits and art installations. The Seahorse and Jelly Fish exhibits are not to be missed! Snapping photos and reading the concise bilingual signage is encouraged. ."
1187,2014-07-27,3,"Great place to bring the kids, but in the 10 years we've been coming here I'm starting to think the price is getting out of hand... Just a couple of dollars change from $200 for 3 adults and 3 children...They're definitely driving it in a direction where it's a special place to visit for tourists (who it's OK to disappoint once) rather than a place for people who live near to visit again and again.My advice is to let visiting friends go on their own and save the money you would have spent to have a good meal out with them when they get back...So definitely a place to do once, but over time I think they've priced themselves out of the repeat business market."
1188,2018-01-06,5,"If you visit one of the hotel partners, you can purchase a 2 day ticket for the same price as a one day ticket. [montereybayaquarium.org/… ...just be forewarned with mass humanity, especially on a weekend or in our case even worse - a holiday weekend, you may just skip the 2nd day.There are lots of people, which ironically enough is sort of a metaphor for how much people encroach on these beautiful creatures who depend on us to survive. At the aquarium it's the people feeding, maintaining, and being conservationists. Outside in the real world it's all of us making decisions in our day to day life for their relatives who aren't captive, like forgoing our straws and avoiding plastics in general. Make sure you know how to use your camera or phone, too. There were too many people using their flashes, but the best place to get some incredible photos is up near the kelp forest. There's a little circular window where sharks and schools of fish swim. It's like a small corner of solitude amidst the chaos. Outside snacks are allowed and thankfully the outdoors are readily accessible from a variety of balconies. The work this place does is tremendous, the animals are astounding, precious, and incredible. It's a steep entry, but wholly worth the investment."
1189,2014-07-13,4,"Let's get this out of the way:Adult = $39.95Child (3-12) = $24.95Student (13-17 or college ID) = $34.95Senior (65+) = $34.95On our recent excursion to Cali I was able to convince the BF that the Monterey Bay Aquarium was worth a trip. I'm a bit of an Aquarium novice, I haven't been to many but I hope they're all as nice as the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I was blown away by all the exhibits and the overall layout of the space.  It's very educational and is an excellent family destination.  The Monterey Aquarium is selective with the presentation of all the exhibits and designs them with background colors to assist visitors with excellent picture taking opportunities.  This is especially noticeable with the Jellyfish and the bright blue background, truly breathtaking and one of my favorites.Another must see are the active sea otters - I openly love them for their playful ways and become mesmerized as I watch them interact with one another.  If you have time you should make it to one of their scheduled feedings to really behold the little guys trying to use their smarts to get their food out of some playful contraptions.I would gladly return on future visits if time allowed.  For those locals, I would work your connections and see who may already behold monthly or yearly passes to save on the cost."
1190,2017-03-22,5,"If you ever hear about Monterey you've most likely heard about the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but for good reason. I've been to the aquarium more than 5 times, and I currently have a membership. In my opinion it is completely worth it. I've never had any problems with this establishment. The staff are very knowledgeable on the exhibits, the animals, the food, and the city of Monterey as well. Everyone has passion for what they do, which makes you enjoy the experience that much more. Depending on the day, it can get a little packed, but it doesn't affect the experience that much. For parking I definitely recommend the parking garage a couple of blocks from the aquarium. There are many signs to indicate where it is. It costs $10 but it is all day parking, so you get your money's worth. Overall, this aquarium is a must for anyone that travels to the Monterey area."
1191,2017-02-18,2,"I hesitate to give this place any stars at all.It's a tourist trap, and an expensive one at that. They claim to be a ""not for profit"" but the admission is ridiculous. They also do not partake in reciprocal relationships with other aquariums and zoos if you are a member. That cost them us buying a membership from them.The exhibits are okay, but the place is so crowded good luck seeing anything. It is also dark so not a good idea to let small kids wander. The otter exhibit was a huge disappointment, and the touching pool had no staff so the poor sting rays were all cowering in a corner, they looked afraid and I don't blame them, kids were slapping the water and moving their arms around trying to get them to come over.This is a once in a lifetime thing. I was told this was a world class aquarium but it's just an attraction for unsuspecting tourists willing to part with their money to say they went there."
1192,2017-08-13,1,Recently went vegan/ vegetarian n do not applaud the captivity of free beings compacted into confined spaces for enjoyment of the oppressor
1193,2019-03-10,5,"went today for the first time with wifey and daughter. really nice.  kind of pricey, but we only live once. i would recommend this aquarium to others"
1194,2016-07-31,5,"Not only is this an amazing place to see all the beauty that the sea offers. The staff was amazing. And not just in a way that they helped us navigate throughout this beautiful place for map challenged people like us. BUUUUUUUTTTT, we lost our 7 year old. I asked a staff member where I should go, and within 30 seconds there was a security guard asking me questions and had a description & picture of him to the whole building. I've never dealt with a more friendly and responsive staff!!"
1195,2018-09-22,3,"I hadn't been to the Monterey bay aquarium for nearly 15 years. I remembered loving it as a kid. So we made the 2 hr drive, paid $50 each, and well....was a little disappointed. This place is mostly geared for little kids, with a few side things for adults. Main attractions consist of the very large kelp forest, jelly fish, and very small penguin and sea otter exhibits. If you're not into sea snails and crabs, everything else is kind of lame(for an adult). They have a lot of hands on and other features for kids. The two of us spent about 1 1/2 hours. Canery Row, which is a strip of shops and restaurants outside of the aquarium, made the trip worth it."
1196,2015-10-28,5,"Not your average aquarium, this is one of the best in the country.The kelp forest is amazing! It's actually divided into deep and shallow waters on two different sides. The forest however is truly a marvel. Walking around and seeing all the different exhibits, you can see both sides from different Windows and angles. There is a top level also where you can see the shallow water fish.The deep sea side is amazing with various jellyfish, plankton, and a huge tank with sharks and tunas. This can also be viewed on the lower level as well.The lower half of this side has sea otters, and their sanctuary. This aquarium has a lot I did not cover including an observation deck, aviary sanctuary, and otter rescue.At $48 per adult, you may balk but to see the history of fishing in the area, the exhibits and sanctuary, plan to spend 4-5 hours and the fee is definitely worth it!"
1197,2014-05-27,5,"Amazing, relaxing, educating & interactive fun for all that visit!Came here during Memorial Day & it was not crowded....in fact it seemed like a normal day.Staff & volunteers where completely polite, patient & cheerful to all those that arrived. I was equally grateful & Thanked them for making themselves available on a National holiday.Marine biologists were on hand as well to take time for feeding presentations & documentaries at their spacious auditorium.Had lunch at their Café & you must have the Bread Bowl Clam Chowder!!! Lots of selections of foods salads, panini style sandwiches, pizza, pasta etc. for the entire friends & Family.They have a new display section called ""Tentacles"" provided everybody had a fascinating time observing octopus, squid & cuttlefish.This place is a Must See in your lifetime....so bookmark this site!Fortunately, I have the family ticket package which includes 2 free daily admissions per visit.....invaluable & very gracious of the Monterey Bay Aquarium organization.So who knows my Yelping Amigos?....maybe We can meet up & validate my Review together!?!"
1198,2014-06-17,4,"Ocean wildlife has always interested me, and Monterey Bay Aquarium definitely satisfies that interest. There are several different exhibits ranging from penguins to kale to coral reef to jellyfish. The displays are gorgeous and very nicely put together. They even have a couple of ""touch ponds"" (pretty self-explanatory) where you can get a ""feel"" of several plants and creatures themselves. The most beautiful displays for me are the Jellyfish and the Coral Reef, which are both captivating and will keep you standing there all googly-eyed, marveling at how beautiful ocean life really can be. The aquarium is very kid-friendly and hands on, with many interactive displays with buttons, games, videos, etc. Kids are everywhere at this place and it definitely makes you appreciate the small, beautiful things in life that we take for granted. So many kids there were jumping up and down and pointing with excitement at all of the pretty blue displays of wildlife that we never really see. There was even a large play area that catered to smaller children & had tunnels, games, little peek-a-boo displays, etc. I look forward to bringing my tot back here when he is older. There are even convenient areas to park your stroller as you go from display to display.I will say that i was somewhat disappointed with the size of the aquarium, as i assumed it was much larger for some reason. It's two floors (from what i saw) and--don't get me wrong--the aquarium itself is beautiful with much to look at, but after i had seen everything i thought to myself ""wait, that's it?"" Especially since we paid 80 bucks for two adults to get in. But hey, all in all i had a good time here and i'll for sure be back sooner than later, especially with all of the other attractions Monterey Bay has to offer."
1199,2017-06-02,2,"So many kids, so many people, the Vancouver Aquarium was much better."
1200,2014-07-23,4,"While the aquarium is beautiful, I really cannot justify the price of entry. Tourism at it's best. Overall, probably the best aquarium on the west coast. Beautiful scenery, in the historic Cannery district of Monterey. Great for families, but save up before going and pack a lunch because this place will attempt to break your wallet!  I enjoyed the jelly fish exhibits the most. I just don't understand how come they had two sections for jellies. It was a little repetitive. Also, don't forget to watch a feeding. They're really fun and educational. My boyfriend & I was able to cover all of the exhibits, take pictures, whale watch with binoculars, and watch the sea otter feeding in about 2.5 hours. Parking was a bit confusing for us non locals, what with the one way streets and hills, etc. Best bet is to pay for a spot in the parking garage on Foam St for a flat rate of $10 all day, and spend the entire day perusing Cannery row and eating some yummy clam chowder!"
1201,2017-08-02,5,Amazing! Definitely buy tickets via your Hotel- we did 2 days for the price of one day via the hotel. We ended up doing half of the Aquarium the first morning and left by noon; and came back the second morning to do the other half! We do not have kids but just got married and enjoyed our time as adults there. Beware- parents of the little kids are super aggressive but don't let them be mean BC you don't have a kid with you! I paid just as much or more to get in then your tiny kid! :)
1202,2018-03-07,5,I love this place.  Best aquarium because of the location.  Parking is a hassle but very well worth the walk.
1203,2016-07-08,5,"Love this place! It's crowded for a reason. My 2 1/2 year old really enjoyed her time here. She didn't wanna leave. She wanted to find Dory and Nemo... and she did! She spent a good twenty minutes talking to this one tank with all the fishes, it's too funny. Splash zone was her favorite area, she got to touch the sea orchin and starfishes. She really liked the stamp stations. The play area gets chaotic with kids running around, yelling and screaming, younger kids can get knocked over so be careful there. Kids will get wet, remember to bring an extra pair of socks and clothes for the splash zone. Oh! Get your tickets early, we got in right away and no wait time. The purchasing ticket line was long but it looked like it went pretty fast, they are very organized."
1204,2018-03-05,5,"I adore this Aquarium and being a member is wonderful. Trick or Treat in the Aquarium for Halloween, after hours, members only parties with live music and wine tasting. Christmas events, night time picnics and imagine spending the night! Sleeping in front of the jellyfish or kelp forest. Yes, you can do that. Super cool place to visit again and again."
1205,2016-04-11,4,"It's a very informative place for people to learn about the ocean. People here are very friendly and they will explain to you with their knowledge if you have a question. There are some sea cucumbers, crabs, sea stars, sea Uni that they allow you to touch it. The big tank of fishes are swimming around. We feel so relax to see then swimming in front of you. This place can definitely teach children with a lot of knowledge and bring up their interests about ocean creatures too. There is street parking with meter if the parking structure is full."
1206,2016-10-06,5,"Sunday morning, no line and no crowds. Perfect time to go! The aquarium is always inviting with the kindest, helpful & knowledgeable volunteers. The interaction with these wonderful people is what Disneyland used to be. This is what makes your visit so much more enjoyable. Besides being surround by gorgeous tanks full of beauties what other way could you enjoy your day? Everything is kept very neat and clean. Attendants throughout the aquarium make this possible. The cafe/ coffee counter have great selections for everyone in your group. Prices aren't too bad for the quality of food you receive. Not too shabby of a little meal we had. Short Rib Chili, Clam Chowder, Breakfast Sandwich, Turkey Sandwich were all fantastic!"
1207,2015-08-31,4,"The price of admission is a bit high - but this World-Famous exhibit is the best of it's kind on the entire planet....and they obviously know it. Watch huge Groupers ""relax"" inside a towering, 40-foot Kelp bed....while the simulated ocean current sways them like a hammock. See hundreds of thousands of Sardine and Anchovies cluster in massive schools, while Bluefin Tuna, Sea Turtles and Dorado zip by. Witness how Monterey Bay was once a hotbed of fishing and canneries(1902-1973). Go for the lessons learned by all....we need to sustain all species of sea life."
1208,2016-07-27,5,"I love this place! The ocean has always fascinated me, so coming to the aquarium is a special treat. My boyfriend and I have been members for a couple of years now, and it definitely pays for itself if you plan on going more than once. You also get early access or late days to hang around the aquarium with other members. These times are a lot quieter. They have sleep overs in the aquarium itself, so you can pick your favorite spot, throw down a sleeping bag, and sleep with the fish! I'm not sure if that is members only, but it's still super cool and worth it! I highly recommend the tours, as you get to see whole new sides to the aquarium that you wouldn't see otherwise. It can be crowded, especially on the weekends and when school is in session (field trips, yay), but it is still manageable. The exhibits are beautifully done and if you come during the right times, you can see a feeding, which is neat too. Overall, I highly recommend the aquarium to anybody visiting Monterey. It is pricey, especially if you just buy a day pass, but the money is going toward the greater good of sea life near you!"
1209,2015-04-14,5,This is by far the best aquarium I have ever seen by  a long shot. It's gotten larger and larger over the years to include more and more exhibits. My favorite so far is definitely the jellyfish. So cool....It can get a little crowded during peak times.
1210,2017-01-02,5,"I just love going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It is a great place to appreciate the ocean and all the animals in it. It is a nonprofit organization and they do a lot of great work! They have a program to help save sea otters and rehabilitate them back into the wild. It is also just a fascinating place to explore. They change some of their exhibits occasionally, so it is definitely a place to keep coming back to. The only downside is that it can get crowded at times, but for the most part people are respectful. I would recommend to any ocean and animal lover!!"
1211,2018-09-01,5,We are here now and it is amazing here. Although it is a bit packed today but my daughter is having so much fun. We haven't seen even half of it so we probably stay here for 1-2 more hours
1212,2014-07-31,4,"Truly a wonderful family experience.  Pretty big space without the trained dolphin nonsense of San Diego.  I can appreciate the wildlife without teaching the animal how to dance for a treat.  Well decorated exhibits, lots of things to do for younger kids and the feeding shows are a real highlight.  I'd sure love to scuba dive in the big tank.  This was a real big part of our central CA vacation."
1213,2015-04-04,4,Monterey bay aquarium is the place to be. My grandkids really enjoyed all that's there to see. The fact that they have hands on activities for children was a plus even if it means getting wet.Everyone was pretty helpful. Just a lot of people though..especially on weekends.
1214,2018-02-25,5,Simply the best and most astounding aquarium in the world.From the Jellyfish to the massive tanks - you'll be amazed at every turn.Great for children of all ages.You can't come to Monterey without visiting this incredible aquarium!
1215,2018-02-25,5,This place is the tits. I live locally and have a membership. The best time to go is on a week day after 3 when the school trips are over.
1216,2018-02-24,5,Love..... Love.... Love this place and all that they do.  There are a lot of people so if you don't like big crowds then you should probably go durning the week. But worth every penny.
1217,2014-06-06,5,It's quite a drive to get to the Monterey Bay Aquarium but once you get there you quickly realize it is well worth the drive. A few months ago I bought the season pass for my family and it seems each time we go it is a new adventure. The jellyfish exhibit is worth the trip alone. Never knew jellyfish could be so beautiful and colorful. It give you a perspective of the sea that maybe you never realize existed. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable to answer all the questions. I also like that they have an exhibit of plastic trash and the effects it can cause to the sea. This is great as all the young kids that go through the exhibit brings them the awareness and perhaps be more mindful and respectful to the environment.I bought the season pass as I plan on going when I have relatives from out of town to also enjoy the experience.
1218,2016-08-31,5,"This lady does not dig aquariums, and this is NOT your ordinary place. Continue on.I had been told of the wonders that reside in monterey bay: endemic species of flora and fauna, an increible rich kelp forest that feeds a huge amount of animals living off the Pacific coast, incredible weather, progressive minded people, and possibly the best and most elite aquarium in the country!How and why did I fall in love with this place? The animals made me do it, the ones who were born there, the ones who work there, the ones who have been rescued and continue to survive in this place. The incredible hands behind all of this work should receive a daily applause! These people are SERIOUS about conservation of the bay and absolutely everything that lives in it, from it and with it.Also, otters... The very first sea otters I saw in my life where here, and I could not contain my tears, their cuteness is beyond words. My parents and I navigated the whole place and took the party outside where we found a bunch of seals ""trying"" to bask in the sun (it had rained and it was very gloomy that day). They were adorable, wild and free. Also, this is NOT only at the aquarium, but the Monterey Cypress trees are ALL OVER the coast and they are to die for! Dye me with these colors (That bark! That green!) - anyone throwing a party to celebrate the beauty of this place? Don't forget to call me! ;)"
1219,2016-06-01,5,Simply amazing. Favorites were the otters and the jellyfish/cuttlefish/squid display. The documentaries in the auditorium are very nice and let you see the research/science side of what you are looking at. Nice touch that they have real people narrate and answer questions. Staff was excellent throughout. Very courteous and incredibly knowledgeable on the creatures. Feeding times are great time to see the animals active and get some insights from the staff talks and question answering.Cafe was great. Favorite was the fish salad at the grill. Pizzas were high quality and a good kid-pleaser.Only negative is the admission is steep ($50 adults and $30 kids) but it looks like it is going to a great cause.
1220,2017-12-28,5,Such a great place to go with the kids. The Jelly Fish exhibit alone is worth the visit! Of course the otters are adorable and fun to watch. My son got to pet a stingray which was fun!
1221,2014-06-15,5,"Summary: Better than I remembered. A plethora of sea exhibits, so craftily organized and laid out that you can't help but be fascinated by the mystical world of the undersea depths. Favorites include the psychedelic jelly fish, watching the cute otters get fed, and the cephalopods that could actively pulse and change colors. Amazing! What a great way to spend several hours exploring a rarely seen part of our planet. Perfect for the little ones, too. Note: there is no aquarium-specific parking, so find a structure nearby, pay the $10-$15 for all day parking, and make the walk down through town to the aquarium. Spend the day in the town shopping, eating, and enjoying the harbor. Bonus: Buy tickets online in advance with AAA or other discounts and avoid having to wait in line to get tickets and save money at the same time.I came here with my wife, her family, and our 14-month old nephew after having not been in over a decade. I honestly didn't remember much of it at all. I knew it was big and impressive, but I didn't realize it was lots of fun, packed with really interesting creatures, and a great way to spend several hours.  We went on a Saturday around noon on Memorial Day weekend and had bought tickets in advance online. It worked out great because by the time we parked in a structure a few blocks away and made our way through town to the aquarium, there was a large line of people waiting to procure tickets. We bypassed all of them and went straight in. Winning!Inside, we wandered from exhibit to exhibit, covering both sides of the large facility, including the outside, and the nice (but pricey) cafeteria (which had a pretty long line to get into, as well). There were so many interesting things to see, and touch, and hear. It's a great place for all ages and I highly recommend it for anyone visiting the area. Definitely check out the jellyfish and cephalopod areas in particular."
1222,2014-08-31,3,"Pros: Employees here are extremely friendly and helpful.Cons:Visited here expecting to see a lot more than I did for the price. There was a large amount of people which made it hard to see all the exhibits. It's more suited for children. I would only go if I had kids.Time visited was around 11am on Sunday before Labor Day.Note: If going,Find street parking even though it's a couple blocks down. 4hr street parking is cheaper ( 1.50/ hr) Buy tickets online to avoid waiting in the long line."
1223,2014-04-25,3,"There are a few reviews that have said children have ruined their experiences. Unfortunately, as much as I like kids, they too, have ruined my experience. Here are the highlights with things that need improvement:1. Strollers were a big headache, as they were allowed in quite a few parts of aquarium. There were a lot of issues with traffic mobility. 2. The policy to let shorter people up to the front for shows. For the shows where we're staring at a large pane, this really isn't an issue. However if you're watching the otters being fed, the windows are already fairly small, and it's already not the easiest to see when you're up front. The reason I'm peeved about this is because I decided to go to this show 40 minutes in advance. There were a few other people there that early too. At the end, many of the other people were pushed aside, and children and handicapped people who came 2 minutes before the show were then brought to the front and the people who have waited for 40 minutes got pushed back. I noticed two of the people who waited were not in a position where they couldn't see anything at all. 3. Children running around everywhere!4. There was a super long line to get into the cafeteria to buy food. You also cannot sit in the cafeteria unless you are buying food. There were not many seats with tables to sit outside of the cafeteria.4a. This lead to people sitting on stairs and blocking stairways. This was a headache because there were children going down the stairs too, and people going up the stairs, and parts of it were blockedTips:1. Bring your own lunch.2. Buy tickets with AAA. I still have my grad school ID, and thus the AAA student ID was the cheapest ticket I could find. Still fairly expensive, but I don't mind paying to help with the maintenance of the facilities that benefit the animals. In the end,Try to find a weekend where there are a reduction of kids. No matter how much of a kid-person you are and how well you get along with kids... if you want to have an enjoyable time, you really don't want an excessive number of kids everywhere."
1224,2017-09-23,4,"Very nice venue, loved the history of the canneries.  I guess one star off for poor crowd control. We were out-of-towners, seniors, nudged out of the way so that toddlers could watch, because you know, they're totally going to remember that stuff."
1225,2017-07-04,1,I know its for a good cause but get the government to pay for your programs. $50 is too much to watch some fishes. People are nuts. The lines are so long even with such high prices. Its over crowded and boring place to spend your time.
1226,2014-11-21,5,"LOVED this aquarium.  My eleven month old also loved it!  His favorites were the penguins, the otters, and the combo bird/fish exhibit.  He was undecided about the tidal pool exhibit as he would eagerly anticipate each ""wave"" but cling to me as hard as he could when it finally came.  :-)I personally loved the jellies and the huge tanks.  If we lived here we would be here all the time - too bad we don't!"
1227,2017-12-01,5,"Went here for the first time today with my husband and almost 1 year old baby. We got memberships so that we can bring the baby back a bunch. The best part... a REALLY REALLY REALLY nice nursing room. There's baby books, privacy dividers and 3 rockers. There's even plugs in case you need to pump. It is amazing and I wish every workplace could have one just like it. The exhibits were great too but if you're a nursing mom it's this one room that will blow you away. Thank you Monterey Bay Aquarium!!!"
1228,2017-11-11,5,Fun and great educational atmosphere for all ages. They truly take care and pride in conservation and educating others. The Sea Otters are my favorite! A perfect place for a family trip- but beware! The Gift Shop costs you an arm & leg.
1229,2015-08-27,5,"Go on a weekday when all the kids are in school so it's less crowded.Beautiful aquarium with multiple exhibits. I highly recommend this aquarium. It's a bite pricey but worth it. I live the fishtanks, I can sit and watch the tank for along time. It's peaceful looking at the tank."
1230,2016-05-19,4,"Think you saw EVERYTHING during your last visit to the aquarium?  Think again...Last weekend I pulled up to Monterey, parked my creeper van, and immediately gobbled up a good helping of edible (medical) marijuana. By the time I reached the ticket counter in my scooter, I was in goo-goo land.  Once you get in, you're bombarded by youths running all over the place like those mini herding dinosaurs in Jurassic Park (número uno).  And then...wait for it...you're giggling your face off and reach the information booth manned by pleasant elderly women volunteers who provide you with a map of the aquarium and a schedule of events.  Do your best to keep your act together as Ruth and Ethel delve into what seems like an endless depiction of otter feeding and other aquatic randomness.  'Tis a mental rodeo!Three things to focus on before you eventually give in and relocate to the cafeteria:1.   Find the round room of schooling sardines and lay on the floor like most of the kids and stare up at the ceiling.  If you drool, it's okay.  Just let it flow.2.  Informative old people + touching random moving stuff underwater = tide pool exhibit.  Do it!3.  Stare intensely at the dark Deep Sea exhibit and try not to soil your britches when the shark goes by.  Wet wipes might be of essence.The whole thing is really a great experience but I had to duck them a star for not having a killer whale abuse show.  Shamwow!"
1231,2018-01-09,5,I've been going to this wonderful aquarium since it opened.  Now that I live here I have become s member. I bring all my friends here when they visit. A great place for all ages.
1232,2015-03-02,5,"I've seriously been wanting to come here for years.  Entrance fees are pricey but the price of admission was worth it just to see the sea otters, jellies and octopus. There are some stunning plant displays that make you want to go snorkeling :). Even the gift shop was awesome."
1233,2018-03-01,5,We loved the indoor and outdoor experience of this aquarium. The displays are so beautiful. The parking garage is close by too.
1234,2017-07-22,3,"Employees were enthusiastic and helpful. The aquarium was ok. Overpriced at $50 a person for 2 hours of entertainment. Extremely crowded and claustrophobic. Personally, I was a bit disappointed. If you don't mind crowded venues and you have at least $100 to spend on a few hours, you may enjoy it."
1235,2014-05-18,4,This is an awesome aquarium.   Tons of fish and water animals.  Beautiful location on the water.  Great mission to learn about and save the oceans.  The whole area of Monterey around the aquarium is very pretty (and touristy).  The open sea exhibit is probably my favorite.  Especially during feeding time.  It is worth trying to catch this show.  Definitely worth a weekend trip if you are visiting SF and have some extra time.
1236,2018-02-07,5,I visit the aquarium so beautiful place in fun employees great service I recommend for everyone the best place in Monterrey.
1237,2017-06-23,5,"Best aquarium by far. Prior to going here I would say that either the aquarium in Baltimore or Minneapolis were my top however this place trumps both. Beautiful views, huge gorgeous tanks, crowded but there's so much space it doesn't seem busy, and the employees were so friendly. I would come back anytime I'm in the area."
1238,2018-02-25,5,I've been visiting cannery row since there were still active canneries and watche the aquarium grow row what it is today. It's expensive but one of the best aquariums in the world. A must see.
1239,2017-12-10,4,It was me and my husband first time going to Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was one of the best memories! I learned so much about animals that we didn't know about. But it's just too crowded. Make sure you come early so you won't wait for a long time in line trying to get in.
1240,2014-06-30,5,"A must see! I loved hanging with the jellies! They have quite a selection there. This is one of the biggest and nicest aquariums I have ever seen! It can be overwhelming, so it is best to try to go when kids are in school so you will have more time to have fun with less crowds. They even have a section to pet the stingrays (though all of the stingrays were gathered near the back, so I don't think they wanted to be touched). I could give you a bunch of details, but they are already on the website. All I can say is that it is worth the $40 (for a one-time thing)."
1241,2014-09-26,4,"The octopus was awesome.  The otters were amusing.  The jellies were  breathtaking.  But can we please take a moment to appreciate the incredible volunteers?  What educated, helpful, talented, and entertaining docents!  I was so impressed!"
1242,2017-12-31,5,"Pricy but worth the cost.  Plan to spend most of the day if you have children.   They put the birds ""to bed""  at 5pm so plan your trip accordingly.   For me the best part is the jellyfish exhibit.  This aquarium is unique in so many ways.  It pumps in the sea water from the Bay since it is built right on it.  This allows all sorts of unique growths throughout the exhibits."
1243,2016-05-19,5,My husband and I were in Monterey celebrating our anniversary and were on the fence about visiting the aquarium. We read the reviews but were hesitant due to how pricey it is. We decided to go and were very happy we decided to go! We had a great visit - loved how many workers were nearby and available for questions and the exhibits were you could touch some of the animals. We watched 2 shows in the auditorium -1 on traveling to Baja and another on white sharks. Both were very informative and would definitely recommend checking them out (would choose white sharks if you only see one). We thought we had seen everything and then realized there was the Baja section that was downstairs but you had to go upstairs to get to it. Make sure you have seen everything before you leave! We arrived right when they open and this was also the time field trips arrive. Next time we might wait until the later afternoon to avoid those crowds but we still had a great time!
1244,2014-07-13,4,"Had a great time here with my boyfriend! We spent about 3 hours in the aquarium looking at all of the cool creatures!. My favorite thing to see was the the octopus and his was the tuna fish.   There are a lot activities going on throughout the aquarium so you wouldn't be bored.   The exhibits were pretty cool, but you has to squeeze your way to the front to see anything.   Overall, I had a good experience and plan on returning with friends. Hopefully it's not as crowded."
1245,2018-07-10,1,We signed up for the aquarium sleepover- horrible experience- they were not organized- they didn't close the aquarium until after 8:00pm- which families collecting sleeping gear from designated areas at 9:30-which were badly marked- then we had too race around looking for a place we could designate too place our sleeping gear. Unpack by that time it was 10:30 - so we were 15 minuets late for the movie- our children were so tired- they stayed up for the movie barely could stay awake- the music was so loud up until 8:00pm- when we asked staff about the sleep over they couldn't hear me b cause of the music and didn't have any answers anyway.
1246,2018-08-17,5,"Highly recommend ! This is a wonderful place to explore and learn all about marine life, great for all ages. My family loves going. They also change exhibits often."
1247,2013-02-06,5,"I freakin LOVE this aquarium!Second time visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It just gets better each time :) There is literally something going on every 30 minutes. So having nothing to do is really impossible. If there is one thing you must see at the aquarium, you have got to check out the Open Sea Exhibit. It is the definition of awesome. When you walk up to that glass window, you realize truly how small we are in comparison to all these creatures. The tuna is bigger than me! And boy you have not seen a school of fish until you've seen them here!We were able to catch the penguin feeding. Seriously, the way they presented it was a lot of fun. I didn't even know I was learning something! I could've sat there all day listening to them talk about those penguins!The jellyfish exhibit was really cool too. There are some that actually glow in the dark! Never knew there were so many types of jellyfish.There are tons of other stuff to check out as well: kelp forest, touching the sea creatures, theater to watch films, seahorses, children play area, etc....We spent about 3 hours here. Wish we could have stayed longer :( If you're planning a visit, definitely opt to go on a weekday if possible. Weekends get pretty busy here.This is definitely my favorite aquarium! Can't wait to go back!PS Sadly the sea otter is currently not on exhibit. Apparently the otters destroyed their exhibit so they are currently in the process of rebuilding. Haha! The exhibit will reopen in March 2013."
1248,2015-09-06,4,Great aquarium and exhibits. Beautiful views of the bay. One of a kind place highly recommended.Just don't go during Labor Day weekend parking is almost impossible to find.  Also there hundreds and hundreds of tourists and their bratty kids which make it very difficult to the enjoy each exhibit. This in no way reflects on the aquarium staff as they are wonderful and attentive.
1249,2014-06-10,4,"Great views all around, little fishy smell standing on the balconies facing the ocean. Lots of kids on field trips so be warned.Bucket list checked off, my favorite thing by far was watching the deep sea tank.I highly suggest renting a 2 person bike and riding up the boardwalk to see a lot of the historic California whaling communities and old Adobe houses. A bike will cost you 8 bucks an hour for a single or double, it's also a great way to get to the pier and grab a bite to eat."
1250,2016-10-25,4,"For the curious and yet still enthusiastic elementary school kids, it is a great place.  For everyone else, $50 is a little steep for what they have.  Nice cafe.  Their effort to provide good ingredients are a plus.  Then again, you're in Monterey.   Would you expect anything less?"
1251,2017-12-25,5,"I loved this! For an aquarium, it was very well done. We easily spent four hours there and caught two of the short 15 minute presentations in their auditorium which were interesting and informative. The views were excellent. Discount is available with your student ID. The nature exhibit which has both birds and aquarium, is separated with the glass only up to waist level so it's awesome how close you are to birds and the tank. Sea otter feeding was really cute."
1252,2017-08-01,4,"Main tips: Go on weekday to avoid crowds, buy your tickets in advance to avoid the long line (including special tours), arrive early to get good parking & pay the fee, get stamp to go in/out of the aquarium, download their app. and text a code to be notified of upcoming shows or feedings.     I was inspired to take my family mainly because of the movie ""Finding Dory"" and my kids' love of sea otters. I read many many helpful Yelp reviews in advance. I purchased our slightly discounted tickets through the AAA website & printed them up. We arrived 40 minutes before it opened & got great parking (self pay at kiosk) and waited in the very short line. If you purchase tickets there, the line can wrap around the building. I wanted to get the special tour about the sea otters & immed went to the counter & was informed it was sold out. Bummer. That could have been purchased through the aquarium's website though.There is a café there, so if you missed or need breakfast (you can't bring coffee out though), it's a good place to relax a bit with a nice ocean view.     Unfortunately, we went on a Saturday during summer. I was aware of the crowds & we dealt with it. For lunch & a breath of fresh air, we got our hands stamped & leisurely walked to have a great lunch (The Fish Hopper restaurant) & ice cream on Cannery Row. We pretty much saw most of the stuff at the aquarium we wanted to & avoided/passed others because of the crowds. We were there when it opened & left 1hr prior to close. Our highlights were the sea otters, the Luna movie & the little live show on the deck. They have knowlegable staff all around. They have an entire play area for toddlers. Typical amount of hands-on exhibits.     Of course, it would be more impressive if it was less crowded. The otters were the main attraction here. But honestly, I still like the Sea Life Aquarium at LEGOLAND San Diego because its much less crowded, very clean & has great creatures there too, including many sting rays & sharks. The Long Beach Aquarium has nicer, larger tanks for viewing. Sea World also as otters."
1253,2017-10-23,5,"Best aquarium in California! Staff is very knowledgeable about the thousands of species they care for and the place is well kept. It can get really pack with tourist on weekends, so try to go on a week day. Favorite part is the huge tank with the massive turtle"
1254,2014-04-30,5,"Everything wonderful that's been said about the Monterey Bay Aquarium is true! Believe what you read and that this is one of the best aquariums in the country and a must visit if you are on vacation here OR a local. This was my 3rd visit, this past Saturday. However, it's been about 6 years since I last stopped in and I forgot how completely amazing it is. We arrived later than I would have liked, around 1 p.m. so only had four hours to breeze through here. It definitely was not enough time and we're already planning a trip back in August/September.To make the most of your day, here are my top tips (there are many but I'll stick to what's most important):*Grab a map when you get your tickets, because it includes important times on there such as auditorium shows, otter feeding times, Kelp Forest feeding times and other demos and presentations throughout the aquarium*Based on those times and what you want to see, plan your day out accordingly. For example, the otter feeding was at 3:30 and the Kelp Forest feeding at 4. We planned our day around that and started on the top floor, working our way downstairs for these two events.*Be prepared for crowds-be patient while waiting to view an exhibit and also be courteous to those around you who might be waiting-take turns*Absolute must see while it's there is the Tentacles exhibit. It was well planned, informative and unlike any other aquarium exhibit*Plan to spend a good amount of time at both touch pools-the one upstairs focues on the tidepool creatures such as the starfish, while downstairs is my personal favorite, the Ray's petting tank*along those lines, try to hit up the Rays earlier in the day. Around 4:30 when I went, they weren't active and seemed to just be ""over it"" in terms of allowing to be touched (is that science?)*Give yourself a full day-this was a lesson I learned the hard way, when at 5 o'clock, there were one or two exhibits I hadn't made it to yet as well as found myself rushing towards the end of the dayMust sees include the otters, jellies, Kelp Forest and the Open Ocean which was fabulously done. I mean it's all a ""must see"" but if you're on a limited time schedule these were my absolute favorites (second to the touch pools of course.)On a side note, the gift shop was top notch. The quality of their souvenirs was quite impressive and whoever does their t-shirt and sweatshirt designs, does a beautiful job. The designs had a vintage, hipster twist to them and would be fun to wear considering they are ""tourist destination shirts."" And yes, I bought some for myself AND wore one out this past Sunday, if you must ask. The shop also features quality glassware, toys that don't look like they'll fall apart in 5 seconds and a variety of postcard and poster art. Plan accordingly to spend some time there.Finally, parking...Parking was actually a breeze-even on a busy Saturday. We parked at the Cannery Row Parking Garage on Foam Street. Early afternoon there were still plenty of spots and it was $10 for the entire day. I know for sure that I am not going to wait another 6 years to visit!"
1255,2014-02-23,5,"Being a Monterey native, the Aquarium has always been a beautiful place of beautiful memories for me. I try and go to the Aquarium at least twice a year to check out the neat exhibits and spend a day exploring all the amazing marine life.The jellies, sharks, octopus, sea otters and the penguins are always fun to view. The Kelp forest features towering giant kelp, various species of sharks, sardines and an awe-inspiring underwater forest. Checkout one of the Kelp Forest twice-daily feedings for an up-close look at life underseas. The Open Sea exhibit is a great way to marvel at the deep seas' wonderful creatures, includung hammerhead sharks, stingrays, bluefin tuna, giant sea turtles, dolphin fish and a host of other sea creatures. This expansive 90-foot window into the sea world is fascinating. There are some great informative daily shows in the auditorium. The shark show was very interesting and enlightening. The host was very entertaining and put on a fun interactive show. There's a gift shop, a full-service cafe and a beautiful restaurant, Cindy's Waterfront, headed up by locally acclaimed chef, Cindy Pawlcyn. There's quite a few events and culinary benefits held at this landmark location throughout the year. There's even annual sleepover nights during the summer where visitors can camp overnight at the aquarium and enjoy all the exhibits without the crowds."
1256,2017-11-25,5,Great place to bring the family. A lot of people during holiday break. The food line can be crowded but very friendly staff to assist when needed.
1257,2016-04-27,5,"Here are some tips, buy tickets before hand, i had citypass tickets so there was literally no wait.They'll give you a map, also there's a number you can call and they'll txt you the feedings for the day, do that first. Why? you WANT TO see the sea otters eat, it's practically the cutest thing when they float and lie on their back while playing with a floating toy to grab some food and put it on their tummy to eat.It's a nice big place, you can literally lose yourself with the immersion of a big aquarium inches from your face."
1258,2016-04-29,5,"OMG so worth it! The admission isnt even that expensive and they offer student discounts! The giant octopus, the sea otters, and the seahorses are all amaze. Be sure you catch the first feeding of the sea otters at 10:30!"
1259,2015-04-27,4,"Awesome place to take the family. The price is a bit high but I found out that my credit union had discount tickets. It was only $5 off, but with 3 people, I will take the extra $15 in my pocket. We then spent money for the small group tour of the sea otter; this is a must do.My only advice is GET THERE EARLY! it fills up fast and can get very busy.The food in the dinning area is very good, but not cheap; over $12 per person easy."
1260,2014-06-03,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium, as always, was perfect as usual on my last visit!  I come here fairly regularly, and every time its just as wonderful as the last!  This aquarium really is the end-all-be-all of aquariums, and they continue to amaze and educate through every one of their exhibits.  From their permanent displays like the Kelp Forest Tank and the Open Sea to their wonderful temporary shows such as the just-recently-opened Tentacles, the displays are top-notch and its obvious the aquarists work very hard to keep the exhibits clean and the animals happy.  Each time I come here there is something new and exciting on display, and its definitely a place for all age groups, from 9 to 90.  Perhaps one of the best things about the aquarium is their wonderful conservation message.  They are involved with a number of conservation and research programs, proof that they definitely practice what they preach.  I love the fact that they are always educating people through their exhibits, and also through the many docents, volunteers, and visitor services people on the floor as well.  Everyone I interact with there always has great information and a smiling face!  So thank you, Monterey Bay Aquarium!  I also fall victim every time I visit to their immense gift store!  Pretty much a shopping dream for the ocean-lover, they always have great new merch that I always end up buying!  T-shirts, stuffed animals, jewelry, home decor, posters, magnets, key chains, cups, prints, books....if you love the ocean, you have to check it out!  The best way to sum up the experience at the Monterey Bay Aquarium is what I heard when I was just there looking at the tuna in the Open Sea exhibit.  There were a couple of kids sitting on the floor watching, and one said, ""Isn't this the best place in the whole world!?""  :-)"
1261,2016-06-20,4,"This aquarium is such a fascinating and educating attraction; all the exhibits in the aquarium will make you feel awestruck. Not only does it showcase ocean wildlife, but also how we can help the ecosystem! It's pretty cool how up close you can get to these animals. Check out their schedules online so you can watch a feeding session!You can probably get through seeing everything in about 45 minutes. I wish they'd put in more exhibits; I feel like this place gets smaller and smaller every time I visit. It's okay, it's always a fun experience!* Finding parking is tough! If it's busy, just go into a parking garage. Most of them are walking distance from the entrance."
1262,2017-10-31,4,Worth going to if you've never been! The highlight is definitely the otters - it's a unique attraction. The work they do in the local ecosystem is worth supporting as well.
1263,2018-08-10,5,This place is wonderful for all ages. The children have hands on experience with plenty of water tanks. The added play place adds more fun. The staff and volunteers are patient and eager to share their knowledge. Please Go !!
1264,2018-01-13,5,Love the aquarium and all of the coastal conservation work that they do! Great place to visit any time of the year.
1265,2018-01-12,4,"Nice aquarium. Kids love it and so do i. Great balance of animals. Totally worth visiting several times because you cant enjoy it all on one day. Major downer for me is the amount of people! Too many to walk freely and enjoy sometimes, overwhelming. Its good MB aquarium, but it is hard for members."
1266,2016-09-24,4,"We haven't been to every major aquarium on the west coast, but probably been to most.This is the best.  Bottom line, this is one of those must see area attractions.  Even if your appreciation of sea life extends only to enjoying a nice halibut steak or sushi roll.Had not visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium in about 20 years (pre-kids). Stopped here in August during a family road trip. Me, wife, three kids.It is definitely big league now. With admission prices and crowds to match. Think Disneyland with fish. But, well worth it.  If you are staying at a local hotel, check to see of they have discounted ticket packages. Some have a two days-for one offer that allows you admission over two consecutive days.  Might be worth it since there is so much to see.During the summer, they have extended hours on the weekends, staying open until 8 pm. The day we went, they were actually open until 9pm due to a special event. You can also get a hand stamp if you wanna leave for a bit and come back.  On our visit, we left to eat dinner down on the wharf and came back around 8 pm. No crowds then. Awesome.We took the behind the scenes tour which was fun and informative. Got to see the inner workings of the place. Parking is a bit challenging.  There are nearby pay lots, but you may have to do some walking. Free shuttle buses run up and down cannery row dropping off and picking up in front of the aquarium. So, you can actually park down near Fisherman's Wharf and take the shuttle to the aquarium or vice versa.Yes, it is crowded. Yes, there are lots of kids running around.  Those two things usually come as a package deal for cool attractions. It is what it is. Check it out."
1267,2015-01-05,4,"I wanted to get here as soon as they opened, figuring that it would be less crowded compared to the afternoon.It was still incredibly crowded.There was a line to buy tickets, but it went pretty fast and all the staff members were friendly and helpful with any questions we had. We saw the first otter feeding at 10:20 and it was so packed it was a tad bit uncomfortable. There was more room downstairs although you don't get as good of a view.My favorite by far were the jellyfish!! So pretty!Overall, I thought the aquarium was pretty fun. We went through the whole thing in about  2 hours, and there was no rushing. Do be careful about getting trampled by kids though. But it's an aquarium, what do you expect?"
1268,2016-02-22,5,"monterey bay aquarium is my happy/peaceful place where i can stick in my earbuds and sit on the second level of the deep sea tank and stare at fish for hours. the crowd just vanishes into oblivion every time i come... that's until i accidentally touch the tank, which has probably been contaminated with the germs of ten thousand children's sneezes and slobber.other than the germs, the otter feeding is probably one of the best activities to check out. get there maybe 10-15 minutes prior just to find some space. they'll make tall people step back so the kids can contaminate the windows, but if you're short like me, you'll be lucky enough to stand close enough to the carrier monkeys and witness rosa, ivy, and and kit enjoy a few shucked clams, shrimp, and sepia.note to visitors: bring hand sanitizer and don't touch the tanks."
1269,2016-08-03,5,"This place is so cool. World class aquarium, set on the gorgeous pacific coast right in Cannery Row in what was once a cannery. The aquarium now tries to preserve and protect the marine seascape from the wanton destruction caused by fishing, development, pollution and global warming. Lots of cool fishes to look at and touch. Exhibits pitched to all ages. We saw the shark feeding and the penguin feeding. Both entertaining and educational. Spend an hour, spend the day. It's well worth it."
1270,2016-06-16,4,Such a great experience! Good for kids and great for a date! Coolest attractions are the otters and the jellyfish! Recommend going early morning or late afternoon to avoid the school of children.
1271,2014-08-18,5,"One of my favorite places to come to. During the summer it's a bit more crowded, but if you're patient you'll be able to see all the exhibits. During the summer they also stay open later (until 8PM) and have live music. Probably a better option to come later if you want to avoid being run down by a stroller. Feeding times are 11AM and 4PM at the kelp forest. The diver speaks to the crowd from inside the tank and points out different fish- really interesting! Throughout the day there are different events you can attend at the exhibits. They also have short 15 minute presentations in the auditorium running all day. There is street parking as well as a park structure on Hoffman Street that is a flat $15, with no hourly parking or in-and-out option."
1272,2016-09-21,3,"I love this place for what it is. I hate the crowds. I probably need to get a membership again so I can go at off times or take advantage of member-only events.  The last time I went we there were 5 adults and 2 children (1 was 3 years old). Luckily we had passes otherwise it would have been very expensive. But the upkeep, new exhibits and expansions are expensive. The crowds though are awful. I think we got to the big tank at feeding time and it was impossible to move and it was stuffy.  It was so bad I needed to get out to be able to breathe. I think I am nostalgic for the times when you could go to the big tank and sit, relax and reflect.I love the aquarium. I always learn new things. The exhibits are wonderful. Everyone should go.  I just want to go when its a little less frenetic."
1273,2016-04-10,4,"Aquarium is nice, better than SF, but pricey. You can possibly finish the whole thing in 2 hours, 1.5 hours if you rush it. Some are touch screen, and some are touchable creatures. Good spot to check out."
1274,2016-03-16,4,"We came. We saw lots of fish. We left.If you like fish and fish stuff this is the place. The have big fish, little fish, colorful fish, plain fish, fat fish, skinny fish, polka dotted fish, striped fish.Fish you can touch, Fish you can't touch.Fish that are easy to see. Fish that are hard to see.They have fish on the ceiling, fish on the floor and fish on the walls. They have so many fish you'll even wonder if they have a fish on a dish. They probably do in the gift shop."
1275,2014-09-15,5,"Love, love, love the aquarium! I got to participate in the Ocean Plastic Pollution Summit for teachers and was thoroughly impressed. The staff were so friendly and knowledgeable. It was an awesome experience and I look forward to more seminars in the future. As for the aquarium itself it's fun and very informative. It will make you excited about marine life, and I always leave wanting to read more books and learn more."
1276,2015-03-31,5,If you like animals or fish or sharks or plants or love being mesmorized come here! I am a child at heart and I loved every second in this place. The place was super crowded though! lots of people but its an aquarium and out ranks aquarium of the pacific in Long beach by 100x and now I know why. The volunteers were so knowledgeable and friendly. Even the quick service restaurant was pretty great.I wish I could sit in front the the deep sea tank for hours. Or play with the Sea Otters. It really was Special and I wish I could come back soon.
1277,2016-08-04,5,"We are members of three years and blown away every time by how clean, beautiful, fun, and diverse of an experience we have there. We love the member events, especially the extra hours in the summer and the picnic! Definitely get some food in the restaurant as it is local and fresh food they will not disappoint. The nicer restaurant is a great date night exclamation point. Get the smores pie and share it with your group as its huge! The new and rotating exhibits are ok and some are better than others. The past two have not been as good as the first one. Sorry don't remember the names of them. Overall, an amazing and unique aquarium and definitely the best Aquarium I have been to in the world."
1278,2015-05-02,4,"WOW, what an aquarium. I felt like a little kid exploring the creatures of the sea! My favorite part was the jellyfish section! They have their light up tanks that looks heavenly.  What I didn't like was that the admission fee seemed a bit pricey even for student discounts. I feel like it definitely could've been cheaper... But nonetheless, the boyfriend and I had tons of fun! Thank you Monterey Bay Aquarium for this wonderful experience!"
1279,2016-03-24,5,"Some helpful tips:1.  Many of the local hotels are selling tickets to the aquarium.  They are the same price, BUT they are good for two consecutive days; instead of the normal one day.2.  If someone is disabled in your group, ask for the child/disabled ticket.  It would is a savings of $15.00.3.  There is an app available that lists the times of all auditorium and feeding programs.  If you are attending a feeding program and you have little ones that want to see, get there 15 minutes early so they can sit up front.4.  Look carefully at the auditorium and feeding programs, some are offered only once a day.5.  There is an elevator near every feeding program on the second floor.  It is a great location for anyone with disabilities.6.  There is a cafeteria style restaurant, but if you want more of a sit down style make reservations when you arrive and ask for a window seat.7.  Remember Mark Twain said, ""The coldest winter I ever spent was the summer I was in San Francisco.""  Pack a light jacket for the summer months.  It is warmer in the fall and spring times."
1280,2014-04-30,5,"This place will make you want to watch Finding Nemo again, and you'll leave with a sense of wonder and appreciate for the natural world.  I can't think of any higher compliment.It's perfect for kids and adults and the 2.5 hour exploration is well worth the money."
1281,2018-04-07,5,"Great aquarium and the displays and decor is worth 5-stars. Staff were knowledgeable and pleasant. The highlight was the fish swimming in schools and the sea turtles and sting rays were in the same display. We could have watched this for hours, it was highly entertaining & there's seating above/upstairs for longer viewing. The jellyfish area was amazing. I was disappointed there wasn't as many sea mammals, there's zero whales, as tons of fish instead. I think we were in/out in less than 3 hours, more like 2 hours with 2 kids ages 12 & 10, they got bored in the kiddie area. While the price was steep, the donation to the cause in the admission price was worth it. We came during spring break from out-of-State and the crowds were ample, and lines were long, but the staff moved folks along in timely manner. Parking across the street cost $15 and felt safe. There's shops all along the pier with restaurants & tourist shops nearby."
1282,2016-08-22,5,"This was a long awaited review I had forgotten about.The aquarium is always nice to visit. Usually a couple things change here and there, most notable favorite exhibits are the octopus, otters, and penguins.Lots of children running around, beware. All exhibits can be done in a couple hours including lunch.Lunch foods are pretty legit and quite tasty. I would say the food is underrated, but the price is over priced because it is in here. Get a snack in between exhibits and have a real meal outside on Cannery Row."
1283,2017-09-07,4,My family and I really enjoyed the aquarium. I must say I thought it would be bigger. Not so much in size but in exhibits. I dont knwo why it would take 2 days to go through. 1 day was more than enough time. I love love how kid friendly and interactive it is my little one was literally on sensory overload. There were so many things for her to touch and do she was on 27 the whole time. I do have to say the quality of the exhibits were better than any aquarium I have ever seen. I especially loved the really big deep sea aquariums. It really made you feel like you were under the sea. I have been in submarine tours in hawaii and that had nothing on being in the dark room with an aquarium the length and size of a movie screen. It was beautiful. I would defnitely go back whenever they have something new to see.
1284,2016-11-24,5,"This was a visit since we were in the area. The feeding exhibits were all interesting for adult as well as children..The jelly fish was the best exhibit, very impressive.  There were movies and many activities,  Great for children,Children will enjoy the exhibits and an opportunity to gain knowledge of the ocean and its inhabitants.The price certainly created a great value.Jack HPlaya Vista"
1285,2017-12-24,2,"It's .... Ok . Way overcrowded . Some , but not many exotic fish . I probably won't return"
1286,2016-03-09,5,"Such an awesome experience. This aquarium is really well laid out, and has lots of sections dedicated to kids and learning which I think is awesome. On the one hand, it has a more catered experience for parents and kids, and in the meantime, it keeps the occupied enough that the other parts of the aquarium aren't completely jam packed with kids if that makes sense. You don't have to be a kid to have a good time though, we had a blast petting sting rays, looking at all the different jellyfish, marveling at the massive shark tanks and laughing at the sea otter tank.The best part of this aquarium is kind of a chance experience in that they have an open tide pool in the back that opens out into the ocean that wild animals can come into. The day that we were at the aquarium just happened to be the day that a wild sea otter rolled up and gave birth to a pup! It was really cool to see, and an experience you wouldn't see at most places."
1287,2017-10-29,4,Wonderful aquarium but slightly over priced. We got there 3 hours before it closed and they should have a price cut for seniors.
1288,2016-05-19,5,"Absolutely recommend this place for all ages. Adults 18-64 $39.95, Seniors 65+ $34.95, student 13-17 or college ID $34.95, children 3-12 $24.95, children under 3 are free."
1289,2015-02-02,5,"Beautiful and Magnificent! Been to several Aquariums, this one was great and worth the price. Very Happy with the Gate and a Bit of Discount (Student) given (No matter what  AAA tells you, the Aquarium is NOT a show your card and save establishment, unlike the ZOO, you MUST by Discount Tickets at Their Office BEFORE arriving).Had my Heart Set on Seeing a Great White in Captivity, but they didn't have one (only sad face for Aquarium, since everyone said they had one).This a great place to learn about life under the sea. Hope to come back again someday soon."
1290,2017-02-20,4,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is an amazing aquarium.  Plan to spend half a day or more.  It is an expensive aquarium and it's difficult to find discounted tickets.  Keep in mind that this is a nonprofit aquarium and the expenses of keeping it going must be great.  There are some discounts to be found; here's a list of places to buy tickets for less:  cheers-2-wine.com/monter….  Go during the week if you can; it will be much less crowded!
1291,2016-08-03,4,"I think this place is basically on everyone and their mom's bucket list, and it def deserves to be. In comparison to other aquariums I've been to this one def takes the cake. as a tiny human, this place was so fun and there were so many things to see and do. it's where my love for sea otters started :) going back today 20 years later, the place hasn't changed much if anything I would just say some of the fish have 'gone to a better place'. for what it is, I think it's pricey ($50/adult) but it's worth it to go once especially if you like animals. there's parking in the residential areas nearby, it's a 10 min walk and it's a nice area to walk around in. just be wary of the traffic if you leave late, it's one road in so you'll be sitting in your car for awhile!"
1292,2018-07-28,5,"Once again, a wonderful experience !!! My grandchildren and also all the adults attending always have a great time , and learn something at the same time!! A high-class , unique experience !!"
1293,2017-10-04,5,Fun and educating. It was not busy so that meant more time at each exhibit which was awesome. I must come back. The views were breathtaking and the staff was friendly.
1294,2016-05-09,5,"Great way to have fun indoors. Check out the feeding timings online and adjust your schedule. The entire place can be covered in a day. Must see animals include cute otters and penguins. There is a huge kelp forest aquarium with different varieties of fish. During the feeding a diver drops in with the food. There's a huge glass to watch into the open sea. Animals from the sea comes there and you never know what you will see. The unpredictability makes it quite fun. Fishes coming towards you from the darkness of the ocean itself is mesmerizing. If you are bored, just step out to the sunny observation decks at every level. The entry is expensive at $40, so come early and enjoy the full day. You can step out for food or help yourself in the adjoining cafeteria."
1295,2014-04-24,2,"This place is a let down. Not worth the $39.95 admission ticket at all. You can walk through and see everything in way less than an hour. For that price, I expected to see the Kraken. The best and most unusual looking thing that they have are probably the jelly fishes."
1296,2016-08-28,5,I enjoyed this aquarium more than i expected toIt was a beautiful experience for me. The crowd was huge & people unable to control their kids were rampant. But in spite of everything i had a great time!
1297,2017-04-21,5,"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!  If you are in the area and appreciate sea life and conservation, or even just want to learn more about both, check this place out!  The admission is kind of steep $49.95pp (ouch) but there is so much to see!  The shows are informative yet brief so you can get to quite a few things and not feel like you are wasting precious time.  The staff is all extremely knowledgeable, the exhibits are beautiful, fun and educational.  And if you get tired of looking at the beautiful exhibits and learning from the films and live presentations, grab some lunch and go sit outside overlooking the bay.  BEAUTIFUL!  Your ticket allows you admission in and out all day long, so you can also go get lunch along Cannery Row and then go back in and finish off your day.  Don't hesitate to check it out!"
1298,2016-03-11,4,"My family had an amazing experience here. It was so big and there was so much to do, so much to learn and for the kids so much to see. They also had multiple areas to feel sea life. that was my daughter's favorite part. And if you're into information and history on all the species it is definitely provided. We found parking a few blocks away and there are some great places to eat in the area. The price was decent not to mention it's right next to the beach. woohoo! Unfortunately there was way too many people."
1299,2014-07-06,5,"Fascinating ! Loved this place, though somewhat pricey at $39.95 per adult and $24.95 for kids- you are still possibly getting a good deal considering they take you as close as possible to the marine world, without getting yourself wet. Saturday nights this summer they are open late thru 8 pm and also have musical performers by the cafe area, making it real lively and fun.  Felt like a kid again staring at all those humongous aquariums. Wow moment seeing the school of sardines going in circles on one of the rotunda. It was a relaxing attraction and a must see when in Monterey."
1300,2016-02-02,4,"A great experience to share with the kiddos.  I can not think of a better way of spending a drizzly, windy afternoon in Monterey than walking around the aquarium and seeing everything with such wonder and amazement.  I also enjoy running people over with the stroller...but thats more for mamas amusement. Anyway, we got there just in time for the otter feeding. My son loved watching the otters jump and frolic in the water.  The Deep Ocean tank with the hammerhead had my son ""oohing"" and ""ahhing"" as well.  I think his favorite though is watching the water cascade over him.  There is plenty to see and do at this aquarium.  On a warm day, its fun to sit outside and watch the otters, elephant seals, dolphins and sea lions frolic in the bay. The jelly fish exhibit is also fun.  They do lots of interactive shows to really teach kids and adults alike about the big blue deep."
1301,2014-01-05,5,"Arguably the BEST Aquarium experience in America.  As an aquaplorer (aquarium explorer), I travel the world (but currently limited to the continental U.S.) in search of the greatest water wonderland.  While Monterey Bay may not be the greatest aquarium, it may be the best OVERALL aquarium EXPERIENCE.....What gives Monterey this title is its prime location: in beautiful, sunny, charming Monterey Bay,  An aquarium like this cannot be built in any other location in America.  The charm of Monterey is ubiquitous throughout this happy go lucky town.  As you park your car and walk a short distance to aquarium, you'll come across numerous local shops, restaurants, family entertainment venues filled with the happiest, most inviting locals and tourists.  It must be something in the air.  And when you finally step in the aquarium, you'll be greeted by even more friendly aquarium volunteers, many are seniors but some are marine enthusiasts who are all just happy to be there.  This fact can not be understated nor artificially created, and this is what makes Monterey rise above all other aquariums.  Now some things about the aquarium itself:1. Park all day for no more than $7 in the garage (there will numerous parking lots indoors and garage ranging from 10-20$.  Look for the $7 on Cannery.2. Explore the aquarium in 4 quadrants (there are essentially 4 big areas of the aquarium located on 2 floors.3. Watch the animal feedings (get there at least 15 minutes ahead of time to enjoy a prime seat for the animal feedings.  The schedule will be on your guide.  You can also opt for texts to tell you of unscheduled feedings).4. Free 15-minute short movies (check your guide.  This can be a nice relaxing sit down, giving your feet a break.)5. Make time for a lunch break.  (This is a must for me, as you should find some GREAT, affordable seafood within walking distance of the aquarium.  Also highly recommend exploring the shops, even just to look and talk to locals.  When you exit the aquarium you can stamp your hand at the exit so you'll be able to reenter).That's it! Now you're ready for a great day at the aquarium.OVERALL: worth the 1-3 hour drive from norcal"
1302,2018-07-09,5,"This place is incredible.  Was as good today as it was when I was stationed here 20 years ago.  Amazing exhibits, incredibly friendly staff, and plenty to see.  My kids and I loved it."
1303,2014-11-05,5,This place is simply amazing. I go every other year or so. I am excited to have kids and take them. Sea life is so fascinating. My favorite exhibit is the tuna's swimming with the hammer head sharks.I really like how they make things like plastic and oil spills part of the exhibit so it helps educate the public. Thank you.
1304,2017-05-25,5,"World class! Better than diving (and warmer). If you love the ocean, you could spend hours here. Where else can you see a kelp forest, from sea bottom to top, or the underside of an octopus. The jelly exhibit is amazing. And we got a kick out of having a wave break over us (in glass). The little rays in the petting area were tired though, so we didn't get to pet them.Join as a member (a little less than 2 adult tickets) and come free for a year, with private members' entrance (no long line). There are usually discount tickets on Groupon.We went on a Monday afternoon, in late May, and there were few people.All that seafood made us hungry, so we drove a few blocks to Sea Harvest restaurant (where PG locals go) to have reasonably-priced seafood, afterwards!"
1305,2016-08-24,5,"Great place to see underwater wild life. The exhibits are beautiful and they have lots of great shows. Come early to get a spot,  seats go quickly."
1306,2016-08-20,4,Great aquarium!  I think the admission price is too high so thanks to my friend who offered me the membership passes free.  Before you come make sure there isn't a special event going on which shuts down the main road by the aquarium.  This may affect your parking plan.
1307,2017-04-10,5,"If you're in Monterey you must go to the aquarium. It's is an absolute gem. * Everyone who works here is nice and helpful and full of information if you've got any questions * The permanent exhibits are beautiful and spacious enough that you don't feel like the animals suffer. They look quite pleased with their lifestyles, in fact, and have a smug look about them. * At the time when we came in there was a Mexico and an Octopus exhibit. Both were absolutely fantastic. Octopi are one of my favourite animals and I was blown away with how great this exhibit was.* The kid's zones, bird sanctuary, stingray petting, and tide pool touch zones are all great. Stingrays are another one of my favourite animals and I love coming here and touching their slimy wings. The bird sanctuary is open so you can get really close to the birds and watch how the species interact. * The various gift shops have adorable stuffed animals, cute toys, fun books, and high quality shirts available. I have unabashedly bought several stuffed animals here and would gladly do so again. I cannot stress how fantastic this place is. You must see it for yourself"
1308,2015-01-06,5,"Best Aquarium in California!Visited this aquarium during the holiday season so it was a bit more crowded than usual according to the staff. However, it was still an enjoyable experience!They have a parking structure that cost $10 all day and tickets for the aquarium are $40 but $35 with a Student ID!It took about 4 hours to get through the aquarium. We were able to take a break midway and leave to get lunch and re-enter later. Plenty of restaurants and beach access walking distance from the aquarium so it was nice to take a break and enjoy the area! The Jellyfish, Penguin, and Otter exhibits are must sees!"
1309,2018-07-22,5,"This is truly a wonderful place to see and support an organization that educates the public about marine life.  There are unique creates like jelly fish, sea horses, eels, and birds and so much more here."
1310,2014-10-23,5,"Do you like aquatic life? Ever wondered what goes in that big blue ocean? Check this place out! This aquarium is amazing for everything that it is trying to do such as conserving marine life in its native form as much as possible. I really appreciate what they do here since our oceans are not in such a good shape as it was before. The aquarium is separated into two stories. Each section shows a different part of the ocean; from deep sea to the reef it is all included here. They also have an aviary section that displays aquatic birds as well as penguins and sea otters! Besides just looking through the glass and observing here are tons of volunteers here that give out there time to help explain the different types of aquatic animals that are on display at the touch pools so don't be afraid to touch the rays or the starfish, etc! There is also a theater that shows different short documentaries that you are able to check out. If you are feeling hungry there is a café/restaurant that overlooks the bay ocean and is very beautiful when you take a moment to just take the setting all in. The café food is decent nothing too extraordinary, but the ambiance is what sets it apart. The most famous thing about this aquarium is the million gallon tank that is on display featuring all different sorts of marine life that you would not be able to see ever. This is the main attraction and also has a seating area on the second floor where you can just relax and gaze at the amazing tank; it's truly something you will have to see in person and usually leaves you speechless. For me this aquarium alone deserves a trip up to Monterey area. It is one of the best aquariums in the world and a place you should add to your bucket list which is why I am giving it 5/5 stars!"
1311,2016-08-17,4,"SUPER pretty! While it's not as big as I thought it was, it was an excellent venture out here none the less. My boyfriend and I stopped here on our road trip because I have wanted to see it since I was 12! The pricing was typical California (just make sure you find a deal on hotels if you don't want it to get too expensive) and all the exhibits were well put together.The biggest attraction to me was the open ocean exhibit. It was absolutely amazing. I sat and stared for hours at it, I was so in love. Getting down to the nitty gritty, the aquarium was very clean, very well structured and easy to navigate. They give you maps up front and had excellent service (at least for me). There is a place to eat there if you want to stay in the aquarium, but I personally just hoofed it all around and then ate out and went back in. If you need a break from the glittering fishes, you can simply step out onto their balcony and listen to the waves for a while. It's very relaxing. I would definitely recommend going here to any fellow aquarium lovers and the place is great for children and families."
1312,2017-11-04,5,"I've been in love with this place since I was a young child. The volunteers are dedicated, the exhibits are world class, and all the money goes to programs the aquarium does to try and restore endangered species and environments"
1313,2017-09-02,5,"I visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium in June 2017 with my family.  We liked it so much we upgraded our 1 day passes, to season passes before we left.  This is one of the best Aquariums we have ever visited.All of the staff and volunteers were very friendly and helpful.It's located in Monterey, at the end of north/west end of Cannery Row.There is no free parking.  Either park in one of the pay parking lots, or feed the meter every 2 hours on the street.  Don't be late added money, or you will get a nice fat parking ticket.The cost to get in is $50 for adults, and $30 for children.  If you purchase your tickets from the some of the hotels in the area, you'll get a second day free.  We decided to upgrade to the family season pass for $250, which is good for 14 months.The aquarium is very large housed in a two story building.  With very large exhibits.  Lots to see and touch.  The have free film presentations on different subjects all day long.  They also have special events such as snorkeling  and trainer for the day programs that are extra but reasonable.  We were there for the entire day, and didn't see all of the exhibits.They have a cafeteria style restaurant which was a little expensive, but normal for the touristy area.  They also have a fine dining restaurant that will take a shark size bite out of your wallet.They have a very large and well stocked gift shop that is also expensive.  Some of the stuffed toys you'll find at gift shops on Cannery Row for half the price.We are looking forward to our next trip to the Aquarium."
1314,2018-07-20,5,"Very interesting interactive experience to learn and appreciate the living creatures on the oceans and sea. Ideal for children. They get to touch the ""ocean livings"""
1315,2016-01-14,5,"So I'm usually the guy that doesn't go to aquariums when I travel because I feel that if you've been to one aquarium, you've been to them all..I WAS WRONG! Monterey Aquarium trumps all. The kids we went with had a blast, but us ""adults"" had just as much fun. There's tons to see. My favorite room (I forgot the name of it) is the room with a whole school of fish that just swim in a circle constantly. You can really forget the time just being mesmerized. I sound crazy just talking about it, but once you see it, you're be like ""ooooo, ahhhhh."""
1316,2017-06-13,1,This place is lame now they took out the shark tank their main attraction. If you're trying to see some lame fish then go if you trying to see some sick predators don't even waste your time or money lame
1317,2014-10-10,5,"Attended an after hours corporate function here and the experience was amazing.  There was nothing like strolling through the Aquarium, glass of wine in hand, and having the place almost to yourself!  The ambiance was romantic, the 3 course catered meal was very nice, and the staff was friendly and attentive.  Only downside was the Deep Sea exhibit was closed and I was really looking forward to sharing that with my husband, who had never been!  But, it was still the best date night ever!"
1318,2015-11-16,1,"Do you have kids?Do you enjoy boring things?Is your favorite thing to do with money throwing in the garbage?If you answered ""yes"" to any of the above questions, you will love the Monterey Bay Aquarium.I was skeptical about going, but all the articles extolling the MBA as ""The #2/#3 best aquarium in the world!!!!!"" convinced me to pony up nearly $40 to get in.What I got in return was even more disappointing than the time the ""super yummy secret treat"" Bobby Lyon gave me in exchange for my lunch money ended up being a scab from his elbow. You guys, the MBA was BORRRRING. Sure, the jellyfish were cool and the sea otters were cute. But there were no tropical fish. No fun exciting shark tanks (or shark feedings). No alligators or crocodiles. No dolphins or seals.The most exciting hands-on touch tank featured primarily ocean plants and droplets from a pre-schooler's sneeze. ""Whatever,"" you're saying to yourself. ""I'm going to take my baby boo boo bear boy/girlfriend here on a date and so what if it's not awesome, it'll still be fun.""BAD THINKING. I went here with my boyfriend, who can make any stupid thing fun, and even he was powerless to make the MBA at all enjoyable. The coolest thing we saw was a tank featuring some giant bluefin tuna, and even then it was like, ""Oh, hey, that's what I ate for lunch yesterday."" The penguin and otter feedings were the second most exciting things at the aquarium, and even they were pretty anticlimactic, coming in a distant second to the miracle of me being able to tell what a toddler I walked past ate for dinner the previous night based solely on the contents of her diaper wafting through the air. A wonderfully rich (and significantly more affordable) experience can be had by visiting the California Academy of Sciences, the ridiculously amazing petting zoo at the Alameda County Fair, and the Marine Mammal Center in Marin County.For a childless adult who is thinking about visiting the MBA, you can get roughly the same experience by fast forwarding through a Planet Earth dvd while you listen to a track of a child alternating between whining and shrieking and you flush 40 $1 bills down the toilet, one at a time, letting the toilet water spray up and mist your face."
1319,2017-06-01,5,"I love the sea animals! You can watch whales from a distance.. they have a place where you can touch the bottom sea creatures.. and large tank views to observe the fishes, sharks, etc. I went here so many times as a child to adult, even until now it doesn't get old :)"
1320,2017-06-08,5,Big aquarium.  A bit confusing to get around but really nice exhibits with lots of places to interact with animals.  We enjoyed it.  Mostly stroller friendly.
1321,2014-08-22,5,"Let's just say that if you have not gone... visit and make sure you see the outer bay aquarium feeding!Feedings:If you are going to go to the aquarium, don't miss... let me repeat myself... DON'T MISS... the aquarium feeding schedule.Outer Bay Feeding / The big tank feeding is just amazing.  SunFish, hammerhead sharks, tuna, Dolphin Fish, and sardines!  Yes, I typed sardines.    Have you ever watched the bait balls of fish on Nat Geo.  Well, you can see it right in front of you without ever having to enter the water in a wet suit.  DON'T MISS THIS FEEDING!Kelp Forest Feeding: This is just so much fun to watch a diver get surrounded by a ton of fish, leopard sharks, sheep head fish, and other types of kelp fish.  The person wears a scuba mask that allows them to interact with the audience watching them on the other side of the glass.  Otter Feeding... What can I say but... cute!A great place to enjoy nature and get a break from the daily routine.  You will find yourself captivated by an underwater world that is within reach of your mind while standing on dry ground!"
1322,2014-06-13,4,"We love the otters!!  We'll stay and hang out by the otters all day.  So fun watching them play, get fed, swim around, dunk themselves in a bucket - so cute!  Can't get enough of them.  We did go see the aquarium too, went outside to the deck (kind of smelly), loved the simulated wave overhead, tried to touch some sting rays (they hid in the corner) and giggled at the penguins.  But the otters steal our hearts everytime!  Entry price has gone up since we last were here - $39!  Ouch! - so get here early and make the most of your day.  Food service is pretty good - lots of organic, vegan, vegatarian, water/fish friendly. Great for lunch!   They have a counter open for breakfast with coffee/juice/pastries in the morning.  Parking is in a lot a few blocks away.  It gives you a chance to see Cannery Row."
1323,2016-06-17,3,"Came here on a Saturday with my husband. It was crowded but too crowded. For a married couple with no children, we enjoyed the aquarium and were there for about three to four hours. Luckily, I had my student ID and was able to get student tickets but the regular prices are too high for my liking. We parked in a structure that was a seven minute walk away. We walked around, enjoyed the sea otters (Whom I REALLY wanted to see), saw penguins and got hands on with the sea animals that I could touch. My only complaint about the hands on exhibit is that there's no sinks to wash your hands. Just foaming liquid soap and paper towels."
1324,2017-06-01,1,"MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM IS NOT HANDICAPPED FRIENDLY!We went on a family trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. There were 5 adults and 3 children. One of the adults was my 88-year old grandmother who has trouble walking. We brought her electric wheelchair to use in the aquarium. When we got there we got it almost to the aquarium and were having trouble with it. I went and talked to an aquarium employee, and she told me we could check our wheelchair and borrow one of theirs (we did not want to come pick it up with our vehicle yet since our parking lot cost $30 and did not allow ins and outs.) We managed to get our chair down to the aquarium and borrowed one of theirs. Two employees said that we could take is just across the street to pick up my grandmother. Then when we were actually leaving the lobby with the borrowed wheelchair, we were questioned again by staff. We explained and they said we could take it just across the street. When we got to the crosswalk the fourth staff member, Paul, would not let us take it across the street. He made our 88-year old grandmother hobble across the street. We started videoing this incident and he quickly ran off.Once inside we found that she could not fit the wheel chair in the restrooms and in the café there were so few wheelchair accessible tables we had to wait three times as long as everyone else."
1325,2017-09-30,4,"Very cool experience. Lots of cool exhibits, I especially found the deep sea tank to be pretty amazing. They seem to also have different things added from time to time. Parking situation is pretty expensive, and I dont reccomend going on the weekeneds because the tourist rush is nuts!! Easily spend a few hours in here."
1326,2015-03-18,4,It was a great time!!The Sea otters are so cute!! We got to see them feed them. Also the penguins are adorable!! It was a great day and convenient while staying in Monterey
1327,2017-11-21,5,"This costs a pretty penny, but it is well worth the money especially if you have children.MBA has thoughtful and interesting exhibits and some are specifically designed for children.DO NOT MISS THE VIDEOS! These are timely and emceed by knowledgeable people who make it much more satisfying, especially for children or the inquisitive.Even the gift shop is a fun experience.A once in a lifetime experience not to be missed!"
1328,2014-01-16,5,"In my opinion, this is the finest aquarium in the nation.  I'm a big fan of Shedd in Chicago, which certainly has a larger variety of sealife, but the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a much more enjoyable experience.  And even on the busiest of days, the lines are nothing compared to what you can see at Shedd.The aquarium is primarily focused on the local aquatic community, but they do have penguins and other non-native exhibits.  The jellyfish exhibit is mesmerizing.  I have spent hours there just watching them drift serenely around the tanks.  I've also enjoyed their seahorse exhibit and their enormous kelp forest.Just recently, I spent some time reading the information and watching the short videos about the former cannery operations and the impact that it had on the local aquatic ecosystem.  Very interesting, and a great reminder of the fragility of the waters around us.Lines to get in can be long on the weekends, especially the holiday weekends.  On these days, it can be difficult to move about inside and very easy to lose your little ones.  We dress our kids - and ourselves - in brightly colored clothes so that we don't lose a family member or two.Here's a tip: even if you don't have plans to come back to visit, consider buying a membership in advance anyway.  For a family of 4, the ticket prices are about $130.  A membership, on the other hand, is about $200 and is fully tax-deductible.  So after taxes, it's almost a wash (depending on Federal and State income tax brackets, of course).  You also get to bypass the regular entry lines as a member and get a discount in the gift shop."
1329,2016-03-22,5,Love this place! We came for my birthday weekend and it was really cool! I went as a kid but hardly remembered anything. We got to watch a while otter in labor. We watched for about 45 minutes then went to lunch. Came back and the momma had her baby 5 minutes before. We got to see her fluffing the baby. My favorite was the jelly fish tanks. There was alottssss of people but my husband and I had fun. It was kinda pricy $40 a person. I thought there would be more tanks to look at. That price is $5 cheaper than the worlds largest aquarium so that's kinda a bummer. It's one of those once in awhile things probably won't be back until we have kids.
1330,2014-09-17,5,"I like to consider myself an aquarium connoisseur, I've visited a lot of them and even volunteered in one of them. My husband, 1 year old, and I headed to Monterey for a weekend to show the wonders of the ocean to our little one. It's no secret that this aquarium is one of the best in the world, but I was super impressed. There are 4 or 5 main exhibits and they do them really well. I always appreciate an aquarium that doesn't try to do everything, instead they focus on a few things and really do them justice. We LOVED the giant kelp forest and the huge open ocean exhibit. I could seriously sit in front of these 2 exhibits for hours. The jellyfish exhibit has it's own Yelp page and rightfully so, it is gorgeous! Normally the exhibits would be enough, but I had a curious one year old with me, so I was looking for kid specific areas. The aquarium really excels at interactive games and exhibits. There was plenty to keep my busy one year old busy, even a really cool toddler section complete with a fish tank and a water feature. I was even impressed with some of the interactive games and I am a tough crowd. There were also exhibit interpreters everywhere and on Sunday we had a great experience with a Discovery Corp teen, he was so sweet to our little one. I must say that one of my favorite parts of the aquarium was the location. It is built into the coastline and Monterey Bay is teaming with life. We saw pelicans, jellyfish, and otters right outside on the deck. We had such a great time on Friday that we came back on Sunday. I've read comments about it being super packed, but we didn't have a problem at all. It is a bit on the pricey side, but everything that they do supports their conservation so it's all for a good cause. There were gift shops everywhere and I felt that they were actually really decently priced, we got an adorable stuffed octopus for $13, not bad. We had a fantastic experience and it was easy to see why this aquarium is one of the best."
1331,2017-11-17,5,"This is a ""Don't Miss"" attraction if you are in the Central Coast area.The exhibits and they manner in which they are arranged (from shore line to open ocean), the attention to detail and its location right on the Monterey Bay probably make this the best aquarium in the world..."
1332,2018-07-11,4,"Great aquarium for children and adults. Lots of exhibits and totally worth the price. Great places for photo ops. The only con is the place gets very busy by noon (we went on a Tuesday), and we would also like to see more hand washing stations. (Lots of touch tanks)"
1333,2016-11-15,4,"First time going, it was exciting but after a while, i started to feel light headed from the lights and smells, so i loved the fact that they had doors to go outside and overlook the open water. I wished it was bigger but it was amazing."
1334,2016-03-14,4,"Def my favorite aquarium. So many beautiful exhibits.  Prices are just a little on the high end, but it's fun to go every once in a while."
1335,2018-07-10,5,"We visited for the first time today, and it was absolutely spectacular! A beautiful place, dedicated to helping save wildlife and the environment. We took a tour, and it was fascinating. The presentations in the auditorium were very educational. The staff and volunteers are outstanding."
1336,2013-12-29,5,"Watching a Sun Fish slowly swim towards a dog toy floating just under the surface of the water a volunteer says ""It took three weeks to train the Sun Fish to come to the ball for its feeding. It's fed a mixture of jelly fish, vitamins and protein. They aren't the brightest of all fish. After three weeks of training it forgot what the ball meant. It took another three weeks of training to get it to learn the ball meant food. They don't really have any predators because they taste like soap and are very bony. All they do is float around swallowing jelly fish."" I thought to myself, ""Sun Fish are the Ostriches of the fish world"". I love the ""Open Sea"" exhibit. It is always changing. From time to time there is a Great White Shark in the tank. Now a couple of hammer head sharks. I always wonder why the yellow and blue tuna swim clockwise and the sardines swim counter clockwise, but that is for another trip to find out. Today is about the Sun Fish. I'm bias to the Aquarium because I purchase the yearly membership. $75 for unlimited access and member entrance. Completely worth it. Go twice a year pays for the membership itself. Just going around the lines just to get in is worth membership price. Each visit there is something new to learn, explore or see. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is well worth the visit. Remember to do one of the tours to get a real behind the scene feel."
1337,2017-11-14,5,"The MBA has become the best place on the Monterey Peninsula to spend a day.  As an adult, I love to stroll through the exhibits, contemplate the jellies, stare at the waves, but children tend to shriek and canter through the MBA.  Plan on all day if you're 16 years and older, 3 hours max with children.  I am personally grateful to the MBA for embracing the ocean and educating us about conservation.  Entertaining the public is NOT the Aquarium's purpose."
1338,2014-11-16,5,"This aquarium is super cool! Best aquarium I've been to in a while. Compared to the aquarium in SF, and Seattle, this one tops it off! They have so much to offer, and so many things to do when you're inside. We went here on a Saturday around the time they opened and it was pretty busy. Crowded and what not. That doesn't mean it was inconvenient either because the place is so big, you can always sway away from big groups. I most especially enjoyed the open water exhibit. It was so beautiful and eye catching. I also enjoyed the jelly fish and octopus section! They had a variety of everything, and they also have a lot of events aka feedings etc. It took my boyfriend and I approximately 3 hours to see everything thoroughly in there. Afterwards we walked around cannery row since it was near, and the aquarium has a BEAUTIFUL view when you step outside their patio. I highly recommend to visit this aquarium when you're in Monterey."
1339,2016-05-07,4,"So this place has a lot to see. And we would of loved to have seen it but it was packed!!! I mean can't even see the tanks of fish because you are 3 rows back from everyone else. I get it, it's a Saturday but WOW. We were so overwhelmed with all the people and it was muggy warm inside because of all the people. We only lasted about 40 minutes...and most of it was walking around trying to find areas open enough to get baby close enough to see something.  The staff was all super nice, and food smelled good. Also the shops had some adorable stuff, but I suggest if you get anxiety or have issues with overcrowding like I, do...then I say skip the crowds during the weekend. We will come back but probably during the week."
1340,2014-02-18,5,"Newsflash: The aquarium isn't just for kids. I was taken here for a surprise visit this past weekend and loved it.  The jellyfish exhibit was truly impressive, the sea otters and penguins are super cute, and the sting rays are fun to touch.  From the outside deck you can also see wild sea otters bathing and feeding themselves!  I was there for about 3 hours but easily could have spent several more hours there watching various feeding sessions. Pro tip: We ordered our tickets online and were able to skip the extensive line and just go to will call. I highly recommend this. Pro tip 2: A lot of the parking in the area only takes quarters and dollar coins. Bring a stash."
1341,2014-11-13,5,"Staff was so informative of the exhibits!  No tour needed. This is a GREAT place for families, tourist, just everybody really. Huge cafe with the best view of the bay,  coffee shop, educational short films, impressive gift shops. Never been to a aquarium like this. Probably the biggest touch (touch live urchins, crabs, clams) tank I've ever seen. Plus a small section dedicated to the history of the Monterey Cannery and its origin. Must see it for yourself!"
1342,2017-08-27,4,"Pay for a private tour it is well worth it! Informational service helpful. Become a member and you can stay after hours for live music and great food, well worth the membership especially on a Saturday 6-8 for the members only! This is by far the best aquarium! Sea lions sit on the beach few hundred feet from the aquarium, gazebo with picnic tables outside the facility if you want to pack a lunch and get away from the crowd."
1343,2013-09-24,5,"$35 for an adult ticket? Cheaper than Disneyland at least, and it goes to a good cause. Those sea otters aren't gonna feed themselves!But if you have friends who have the Ocean Advocate membership ($250), it includes two transferable, unlimited use guest passes. Meaning that you and another person can spend a day, or many days, at the exciting Monterey Bay Aquarium for FREE. Hollaaaa!!There's so much to see here, including:Touch pools where you can get up close and personal with kelp, starfish and even a bat ray: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Lots of colorful fish: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…A large kelp forest, a habitat for many fish and tiger sharks: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Live feedings in the kelp forest: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Animals made from plastic reclaimed from the ocean: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Being on the inside of a simulated tidal wave: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Seahorses: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Lots and lots of anchovies: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…An interactive undersea exploration game: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…A beautiful lookout point on the ocean's edge: yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Cute sea otters, which I didn't get a good picture of because those rascals are fast!And the totally psychedelic Jellies Experience: yelp.com/biz/jellies-exp…Great fun for kids and for adults who are kids at heart (you know who you are)."
1344,2017-07-23,5,My family has loved the aquarium since the first time we visited over eleven years ago. We have come back to visit every 2 years or so. Love the exhibits many interactive and interesting for adults and children. The aquarium is beautiful family friendly. I will continue making memories here with my family year after year.
1345,2016-06-16,5,"I LOVE AQUARIUMS. Despite the price, I think it's worth coming at least once!! There's so many unique creatures (like the flamboyant cuttlefish--one of my newly discovered fish species) that you'll never be bored! If it wasn't so far away, I'd come more often because there are also a lot of shops around the aquarium too. It'd be a nice place to walk around and explore!"
1346,2017-08-07,4,"This review comes after coming here a second time. The first time we went we loved it and it was so fun. We decided to go again, and it ended up being way too expensive to be worth it in my opinion. The tickets are now $49 for an adult, plus you have to pay around $15 to park. And if you come on a weekend the crowds almost make it not worth it at all. That being said, it's still an amazing place with a lot to see, and maybe I'm just spoiled. It just wasn't worth paying THAT much for."
1347,2015-09-21,5,"Whats not to love about this place. The exhibits are top notch, the facility is very clean, and the staff is helpful. I love that they always have new exhibits so every visit is different. I've been going here occasionally since I was a kid and still love it as an adult. Sure its not the cheapest aquarium but you can tell that they deeply care for the animals and the money goes to a good cause. Like everyone else my favorite part is watching the sea otters."
1348,2016-02-29,4,"I had a fantastic experience at the Monterey Aquarium! You can explore incredible biodiversity  and learn quite a lot in what is a truly well thought out space. Most exhibits are well separated which reduces over-crowding and allows one to learn about the various species. I also appreciated the effort to teach visitors about conservation throughout the exhibits; this makes the aquarium an especially wonderful place to visit for children. On that note, if you happen to be an adult visiting during the weekend, you are almost certain to bump into a kid or a stroller every time you turn around. In addition, the sound of kids screaming everywhere mixed with the early 90s new-age music makes for a pretty strange mixture that was not too pleasing for my ears. Definitely do not make the mistake of visiting hungover, this will be quite a nightmare! Finally, I find the ~$50 price tag a bit steep for an experience that will last around an hour. A wonderful exhibit such as this should be more accessible to the public and not only for those who can afford it. Overall, the Monterey Bay Aquarium comes highly recommended. Visit during the week if you can."
1349,2016-05-03,5,"The aquarium is amazing! I spent almost 1 hour just looking at the sea otters. I find them fascinating!The staff was really friendly, willing to help and answer all the questions you may have!I highly recommend it! What they do is fantastic! Can't wait to visit it again!"
1350,2016-08-06,1,"During a 4 day vacation, our last major stop was the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We were excited! My older sister swore by it which is the reason we didn't go to the aquarium in San Francisco. We really should have gone to the one in San Francisco.The layout of the aquarium was a little odd. There wasn't a single path that led from one exhibit to another, that led to a little bit of a free-for-all. People were cutting in front of one another to see various animals. And of course, the no flash photography signs were ignored. Kids were smacking the glass, trying to scare the fish, at their leisure. While it was concerning that the parents weren't doing anything about it, the fact that there wasn't a single employee in any of the exhibits to regulate behavior/crowds made me pretty pissed off. The stairs were extremely slippery and my mom actually fell down them on the way to the Baja exhibit.$179 dollars and one hour later we decided to leave.As an environmentalist, I love what the aquarium does and stands for. It's aim is to be extremely educational and I appreciate that, but the entire experience was a bust."
1351,2017-08-21,4,"Love this place. We are season pass holders and it is totally worth the price. The tanks/aquariums are absolutely beautiful and clean! Love ""tentacles"" section. The food at the cafe is pricey but worth it and the view in the cafe is beautiful as well. My only complaint is that this place gets OVERLY crowded were you can't even see the fish. People get kind of rude sometimes, especially when you have little ones that want to see the fish too. People also use their flash on their cameras, which you are not allowed to do. When people use the flash it blinds everyone because the room lights are either dimmed or off. I would never recommend going on a weekend. Even Monday's and Friday's are bad (especially in the summer). Other then these few complaints, I love this place. The best aquarium in the country. Regardless of the crowds, it is a must stop if you are in California."
1352,2016-11-04,5,"A really great aquarium; probably the best I've ever been to and I've been to the Boston Aquarium and the Miami Seaquarium (but not Atlanta).  It's great for kids and families, or to check out on your own.  They get the lighting and the angle on the glass just right so that you really feel like your in the water with the fish!  Getting to pet the stingrays and touch the sea cucumbers is fun too.  It's a little on the pricey side, but so is everything else touristy in CA.  It pays off to get a family pass if you are local and plan to go at least twice a year.  The aquarium also gets really busy on the weekends, especially 3-day weekends, so if you can go during the week (or at least an ""off"" weekend from Oct-Mar) you can avoid the crowds."
1353,2018-04-06,3,"We don't have kids and don't really enjoy being around kids, so the ambiance and loud shrieking and stroller dodging was a little much. The sea other exhibit was excellent, as was the turtle and sea of fish tank. We could have stood in either of those places all day just watching. The rest of the indoor aquarium, as to be expected, was geared toward kids. Outdoors was great. We loved the guide handing us binoculars to search for whales and it's just such a great area to see the marine life that isn't confined."
1354,2017-07-16,5,Amazing. It's an amazing cause to support. Have family that donates a lot of money monthly and I've been here since a kid for decades and excited even leaving CA to keep taking my kids to this aquarium. Staff should know how amazing job you do in lighting up kids days and more importantly taking care of all these amazing animals: thank you!!
1355,2015-09-28,3,"I just wasn't that impressed. I don't mind that its overpriced, but it seems its in need of a remodel. Long beach is far nicer and user friendly. I wouldn't go back unless with kids and during the week; God help you on the weekends."
1356,2014-01-24,5,"It never gets old coming to the aquarium. My parents have always been members of the aquarium and I didn't mind coming here every single week just to see the otters and the open ocean exhibit. I wish was a fish or even that crazy sunfish just so that I could live there. The seahorse and jellyfish exhibits are so magical. I'm in awe of these beautiful, flowy, delicate creatures. I have at least 200 pictures of the jellyfish and I would happily take 200 more of them. The tickets are quite pricey, so if you are a local I would recommend buying a membership. Or get a group of friends and pitch in for a membership. You'll get guest passes and it's completely worth the price.Do not miss out visiting the aquarium if you are in town!"
1357,2014-08-15,3,"3.5 starsCame here using the San Francisco City Pass (highly recommend; you get to go to 4 attractions and a 7-day all-you-can-ride MUNI and cable car pass!). Having been to the Long Beach aquarium growing up, then to Atlanta Aquarium for the past 2 years, the Monterey Bay seems small and... small. It's a haven for little kids though, with almost the entire top floor filled with interactive games. My favorite exhibit at the aquarium is the jellyfish. There's 10-12 or so on display and they are GORGEOUS."
1358,2016-01-22,5,"This is one of the most incredible aquariums in the world. It is build right into the bay. I used to come here frequently when I was growing up. They have an amazing sea life. My favorite is always the otters. I love to catch the feeding time to watch them leap around.The aquarium offers several interactive displays that are great for children. They also have performers come visit. We were recently able to catch native Indian dancers, which was very cool.My only complaint is how crowded they allow it to be. I understand the desire to let as many people view as possible, but it gets to the point where you can't even see any of the underwater life because there are just too many bodies."
1359,2016-09-04,5,"I love taking my son to the Aquarium. One of the best in the world with a huge selection of habitats and awesome exhibits that rotate in and out-like Tentacles. My favorite exhibit is definitely the open ocean room where you can spot hammerheads, tuna, a huge school of fish whirling about in the deep and majestic leatherback sea turtles flying through the water effortlessly as you stand in awe. You absolutely have to check this place out when you are in town. There's also a ton of information and an exhibit on the old sardine cannery that used to exist there. Having worked in a cannery I find it absolutely fascinating that the principles of hydrostatic sterilizing has been around so long! Aside from the aquatic life, there's an excellent amount of research that is done by MBARI the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and SORAC the Sea Otter Rescue and Care unit. Every time you choose to visit the aquarium or sign up for an annual membership or become a donor, you are giving the oceans and our own marine sanctuary a shot at survival. Please, if you're in town or a local make an effort to spend some time at the aquarium. You will not be disappointed!"
1360,2015-06-30,5,"The aquarium is amazing! It is so much fun to come. I have a membership and I come when I can. Great tanks, fish are beautiful and I personally love the sea otters! I saw some people doing the Outdoor Exploration snorkeling and it seemed lots of fun!! The food at the aquarium is really good! The food is good at the marketplace/food court and the dine-in restaurant is also good!An amazing place for families!"
1361,2014-08-08,5,"I hadn't been to the Aquarium in many years, and it remains every bit as good as I remembered. We grabbed discounted tix at our local aaa office and headed South toward Monterey. We arrived early and started at the jellies and tentacles, which worked great because both were lightly trafficked and at times we had each largely to ourselves. Apparently most people at the Aquarium early started elsewhere in the facility. As the day continued, the crowds grew and our experience got less comfortable. Next time we'll be sure to go early as well. My family's three favorites exhibits were the jellies, sea otters and tentacles.  It was genius to pair the Jellyfish with the 1960s themed decor and music. The furniture, light fixtures, funhouse mirrors and bright colors amid the dim lighting worked perfectly with the jellies. The interactive features were also great. Tentacles was awesome too. We loved the interactive activity where they put the visitors' faces on the big screen and we created emailable videos featuring our faces as cephalopod-style quick change artists. Lots of awesome cuttlefish, squids and octopus too. It was also great fun to watch the sea otters frolicking in their well appointed exhibit. They move so beautifully under water, and their playful disposition can't help but make people smile. The puffins in the seabirds exhibit were also a highlight - they get an Honorable Mention on my scorecard. The aquarium had lots of interactive exhibits, high tech as well as old school fish tanks - bigger and better versions of what you'd find in an old fashioned pet store. At times at first glance it was tough to tell the difference between the tanks with live animals and video screens - they complement each other. I also appreciated the good messages at the Aquarium about responsible fish population management."
1362,2017-05-10,1,This was a complete waste of our time & definitely not worth it to spend $50.It was very disappointing how unorganized this place was.They have so many  employees standing around doing God knows what.We had to just keep walking to look around & try to make it as entertaining as possible.The worst part of this whole place is they charged $50 which is to is definitely NOT WORTH IT.SeaWorld charges the same amount but this Park is well worth it.Never again & I hope those big families that are thinking to visit this place should think about spending that money for this Aquarium.
1363,2017-09-02,5,"A magical place for all ages. No matter how many times you've been you'll see something special... whether a new exhibit, or just a quiet moment of wonder in front of a tank. Parking is busy on the weekends, memberships are worth it if you're somewhat local. We love our memberships bc we can come early and leave when our toddlers have had enough... no pressure to do the whole thing in one day. Fall is exceptionally clear time of year to visit. Also good rainy day activity"
1364,2017-05-08,2,Everybody raves about this aquarium it was OK would be better if people knew how to keep their kids from stepping on my feet and running all over the place with that being said I understand it's a children's attraction but it's also an adults for $50 a person I would like to have been able to enjoy myself more
1365,2017-06-20,4,"This place is a great activity for a free afternoon in Monterey, especially if you have kids. The place is very well designed and they have a fantastic cafe. The sea otter enclosure is a must! My only problem here is the price of the ticket. It's around $50 to $60, and for that price you might as well buy the year membership. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to go around, probably longer with kids. It's a fun experience, just be prepared to spend your money!"
1366,2016-04-03,5,"One of the most prestigious aquariums and centers for research on the West Coast, and the home of many adorable sea creatures. I used to frequent the Monterey Bay Aquarium as a kid, when prices weren't as high. I've been to some other aquariums, such as Long Beach and Chicago, and this still reigns supreme (except Chicago has whales). It will be crowded, especially if you go during a break or a weekend. So here are some must-sees:1. Otters- They are specific to this region of the west coast. Because of environmental changes and constraints, they are limited to the Monterey Bay. They are also so cute! Their special exhibit allows you to see them above and below water. 2. Penguins- I know a lot of aquariums have penguins so they aren't very unique but these guys are so sociable and interactive (and cute!) you can't miss it! It may smell a little in the area, but it's worth seeing them 3. Jellyfish- There is a huge exhibit dedicated to these elusive creatures. You will be in a zen state of mind (or at least a bit more relaxed) by the time you walk out of this exhibit. There are some a variety of colors and species, and you notice you lose yourself staring at those jellies. Note- if you get seasick easily, take caution. 4. Sunfish/Open Sea Exhibit- The two story tall exhibit with the sharks, turtles, huge fish and sunfish (not sure if still there) is simply breathtaking. You can stand in front of this gargantuan tank for about 10 minutes and just watch the fish do their laps. It reminds you just how big the ocean is, and yet this tank is probably no bigger than an apartment. 5. Traveling Exhibit- Make sure you check out what the newest or the traveling exhibit is. The last time I went it was seahorses and it was the most adorable thing I could remember. Other times it's simply educational, but otherwise it always adds something new to the aquarium."
1367,2017-04-06,4,We went on a trip to Monterey and we decided to visit the Monterey bay aquarium.  My 6 yr old like the jelly fish exhibits and also enjoyed watching all the fishing swimming around in the aquariums.   He especially enjoyed anchovies swimming around in a circle.   My 9 yr old liked the touch stations and also liked looking at the octopus.
1368,2016-08-10,5,We loved the aquarium!  We spent about  two hours looking around and really enjoyed  it.  We were lucky to come on a Wednesday so it wasn't too crowded.  Right outside the aquarium you can catch a free trolley ride to Fishermans Warf.
1369,2017-10-24,5,"This was a great experience.  Shocked a little at admission price, but felt we got our money's worth."
1370,2018-06-13,5,Great place to spend the morning with the kids. Many activities to enjoy for both kids and adults. They take a hands on approach and really teach you want you want to learn about marine life.
1371,2017-05-04,5,"Amazing exhibits, super fun things for kids like a water area for touching things and slides and small tunnels, great for the whole family. Set on the ocean there are many opportunities to learn about local sea life and how to help our planet as well. I highly recommend this aquarium."
1372,2018-06-28,5,"What can I say. It's been years since I've been to this aquarium. I was in awe 30 years ago and I'm still in awe. I've been to multiple aquariums over the years. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is by far, the best, most progressive, environmentally and socially responsible aquarium ever. It's not just about watching pretty fish and mammals swimming about in their natural habitats. It's about teaching people about conservation and sustainable harvesting. Which fish are over-fished, which countries harvest fish in a responsible manner and which do not. The way they teach these concepts are entertaining for both adults and kids alike. An absolute Bay Area treasure and must see attraction if you're ever in the area, or, even if you're not in the area. It's well worth the effort to get there."
1373,2016-04-03,4,"Great place, wonderfull for everyone and all ages. We didn't get to see the penguins or otters because it was so packed. There are bathrooms everywhere wich is a plus. The jellyfish were memorizing.  Will definitely be back on a weekday with the little ones."
1374,2011-11-30,4,"Rode in for Thanksgiving weekend and walked around for a couple hours to stretch our legs.This place is big and CROWDED. I would have a better time here if everyone just buggered off.$30 per person? Man, that's a bit steep but I understand it's for research so it's okay.It's not the best aquarium I've been to but it's a nice one none the less. I enjoy the large tank with the Sunfish and turtle and stuff but it's more spectacle than anything else.I just can't give this place five stars because it's just too crowded. The occupancy control is poor and most of the people here bring their children and let then run around as if it were a McDonalds or something. Poor.I love aquariums so I'll probably return again and again, but the ticket prices are not what I would call ""worthwhile"" and if not for the Sunfish, I probably wouldn't come at all."
1375,2017-07-02,5,"Always a fun time here.  They updated some of their exhibits and it is always a good learning experience.  Plus, you can't beat the location of Monterey.  If you never been here it is a MUST to go here if you are in the area."
1376,2016-06-30,5,This place is incredible and the staff is very friendly. My 6 years ok son was fascinated with all interactive and informative attractions. They even have a splash zone for the young kids + complimentary shows throughout the day. Great view to the Peninsula. Definitely going back there when we are back in town.
1377,2017-04-07,1,Nice experience if it's free and your kids go with your local school....totally not worth the nearly$50 to get in...it is super short and the entire experience is as short as 30 minutes...save money and watch The Discovery Channel
1378,2017-09-15,5,The best aquarium ever!  I have been here in the past and have raved about it to my husband.  He was finally able to experience it for himself and he was equally impressed.  The scope of the displays was incredible and I especially was thankful for the environmental focus as well as the rehabilitation mission of this aquarium.  They definitely have their hearts & purpose in the correct priority.  I've been to aquariums from Hawaii to the East Coast.  None compare to Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Well done!
1379,2016-02-28,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a really great place to visit for kids and adults alike! Whether you're taking the family out for the day or you're visiting the aquarium with your significant other, it's such a special and one of a kind experience that you can't really get anywhere else.My favorite attractions are the jelly fish, the sea otters, and the kelp forest exhibit that has many different aqua marine life ranging from hammer head sharks, leopard sharks, schools of anchovies, and many other different types of beautiful deep sea creatures. There is also a restaurant in the aquarium which overlooks the ocean, and they sell food and alcoholic beverages to enjoy while you're there. Another favorite part of the aquarium that I love is the outdoor seating area, where you can enjoy the beautiful ocean view and some fresh air. My only suggestion is to go on a weekday if possible, and if you do decide to visit the aquarium on a weekend, be sure not to go on a 3-day holiday weekend. My man and I made the mistake of going on the Sunday of the Martin Luther King weekend in January, and we couldn't even enjoy it due to the insane amount of people that were there. Normally I get to enjoy the serenity and calmness of the different exhibits, but on the last visit, I was more irritated than anything. We waited about 30 mins in line just to get tickets, and when we finally made it into the aquarium, I was running into baby strollers left and right. Lastly, I would suggest getting an early start to your day if you want to make the most of your visit because the aquarium closes at 5pm daily."
1380,2014-03-26,3,"This last weekend was the first time my boyfriend or I had visited the aquarium since we were kids. We felt like kids in a candy store when we first entered! The different sectors are so pretty and spectacular to look at. The blue background/lighting that they have on the jellyfish make them POP with color! The outside area is beautiful for pictures with family or loved ones. I was disappointed that they don't have a designated shark area, and that I didn't see a single octopus or seahorse! Given the size of this aquarium and with CA trying to move orca's and dolphins out of amusement parks, I really wish they had an area for whales/porpoises. It would have been amazing to see some bottle-nose dolphins, orcas or bulugas. Even the Vancouver Aquarium has them and they aren't nearly as renowned as Monterey.Luckily for me, our tickets were free; if they hadn't been I'm not sure the 90$ or so dollars it would have been for the two of us to go would have been worth it. The aquarium is GREAT to bring kids too, but as an adult it get's overrun with them (which is to be expected). It would be pretty awesome if they did 18+ or 21+ only days so that we could enjoy the aquarium without the yells and trills of children. In the end we had a lovely day, we were just surprised that the aquarium didn't consist of more, especially for the price."
1381,2015-02-08,5,"Definitely a hot spot if you are visiting the Monterey Peninsula. The aquarium is big and beautiful (unless your coming from Atlanta or somewhere with a better aquarium). The jellyfish are always my favorite, especially the purple crown jelly. We are one of the only aquariums with the purple jellyfish, making it special. Touch tanks are fun and the kids area is awesome."
1382,2016-04-03,4,"I remember coming to this place as a kid,it was a lot of fun.For tourists whom want to check it out understand this...1.This is a huge tourist attraction 2.It is predominately packed on the weekends by other tourists & no doubt even more so when Summer comes.3.Be prepared to be waiting in a very long line to get in,& it will be LONG.If you have kids it will be a cute place to check out & no doubt they will probably enjoy the different sea life within the aquarium.It is going to be crowded inside ,so if your thinking that you will have a nice quiet spot in there....good luck.But who knows you may luck out & it not be that busy,but I highly doubt it.If you can however put that aside & accept that this will be the case,then you will have fun.The aquarium is a nice place to check out if your exploring this area."
1383,2017-10-13,5,Absolutely wonderful place. They were awesome in offering free admission to anyone who were escaping the fires from Santa Rosa. The sea otter feeding was fun and there are plenty of things for young kids (son is 3) to interact with. Highly would recommend going at least once
1384,2014-10-19,3,"It pains me to give this fine educational center three stars.  This is a review coming from the angle of regular folks who purchased the full priced $40 ticket.  I have yet to pay a dime to enter here (I did donate though).  Most of the local people here have annual passes that allow them to bring people in here for free.  Annual passes are a better deal, but the bulk of the expenses of the aquarium are covered by folks like you.  If you know anyone that have the annual membership... hit them up for guest passes.  ;)The reason I'm giving it 3 stars:The aquarium is really small.  Take away the kids zone and you can finish the entire trip under two hours, easy.  The biggest tank is a 1.2 million gallon tank call the Open Sea.  The one in Georgia is 6.3 million gallons.  There is quite a difference in size, and yes, size does matter.  The Georgian aquarium is also cheaper, not counting online specials and combo passes, and it is much, much bigger: the reef tank, the tunnel, the dolphin show, all put Monterey's Aquarium to shame.  After seeing such an aquarium, the one in Monterey just can't compare.  They don't even have a tropical tank.Having said all that.  There are a few highlights about this aquarium.  It is very eco friendly.  Instead using a bunch of electricity and running filters, lights, and such, they use water from the bay and pump the ocean water into the tanks.  The lighting is really good.  Mostly from natural sources like big open skylights.  The touch areas are staffed with wonderful volunteers and educators.  They are a really good bunch that makes this aquarium stand out above the rest.  Which is related to my next point: they are supported by a bunch of world famous educators and oceanographers that is helping with ocean research.  The volunteers here accounts for about 3 times the actual staff.  That really shows the spirit of the Monterey Aquarium.TIP: check out the local Craigslist for discounted tickets.  There is no risk.  Just have them meet you at the aquarium and pay them after the aquarium OKs your ticket(s).  You can often purchase them 50% off.  Like I said, lots of locals with extra tickets around.  Free parking available 4+ blocks up from the Aquarium.  Make sure you don't park in the 2 hour max limit.  You may go over that if you decide to venture into Canary Row."
1385,2017-06-08,4,This is a very nice aquarium.. Lots of interesting thing to see. This is a mandatory stop when in Monterey.
1386,2015-08-16,3,"Like many other kids who grew up in the Bay Area, my class went on a field trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium many MANY years ago. I didn't remember too much about the trip, but two things stood out above the rest:1 - Our chaperone took us across the street for ice-cream.2 - There was a giant, swimming fish-head.Fast forward two decades, and I'm ready to take a stroll down memory lane! First off, I went looking for discount tickets. This place is quite pricey at $39.95 for one adult! There's a $5 discount for students, and I know the money is going towards amazing ocean research, but that is EXPENSIVE (& I probably won't be back for another 10+ years at the least)! Many of the local hotels offer a 2-day pass, but I honestly don't think you'll need any more than half a day. There's no official parking lot, but there's street parking ($1.50/hr) or some decent parking structures nearby (I'd recommend the garage on Foam St. for $10/day). There's also a free electric shuttle with a stop right by the aquarium if you're parking elsewhere in town!Oops, I got sidetracked. The aquarium is large and spacious, great for school groups and such. Viewing it as an adult though, I wish there was more to see. The current exhibits, Tentacles & The Jellies Experience, sounded pretty cool, but I definitely wish there was more. The Jellies Experience is more 70's disco and neon lights than jellies, and I really don't know how this can be helped, but all the different octopi were all in their little corners probably sleeping or wanting out. A few cool creatures like the seahorses and clownfish were deep within the kids' areas and I nearly missed them. I arrived late in the day, so I didn't get a chance to see any shows or feedings (except for a random squid tank being fed, SUPER COOL) so my trip probably would've been more fun if I got to see that. If you're coming with kids and can afford it, let them try out the tide pool experience! I saw a bunch of kids with wet suits on, too bad no adults got to play! Their wave generator is also pretty cool, I saw a lot of people taking photos there along with the regular jelly exhibit. At the end of the day, it was neat. It's probably a lot neater if you go on a personalized tour. I really wanted to love this place since it's near my hometown, but compared to the Dallas World Aquarium, Georgia Aquarium, and the New England Aquarium, this one just doesn't cut it. Especially because there was no sunfish. I miss that giant fish-head!"
1387,2016-09-11,5,Best aquarium ever!Just bring the family down and have a great time!
1388,2017-09-11,4,"It's an ok aquarium but visitors around certain open pools to view were rude and would not move for others to see. It will be our first and last time to visit due to their high entrance fees almost $50 per person. The only things worth viewing was the sea otters, penguins and jellyfish. They had two children center needed only one plus a restaurant that took up space for more displays. They do not give on site discounts for AARP or AAA but did one for Vets. Prefer the aquarium in Long Beach."
1389,2017-08-16,4,"We decided to become members. Buy tickets online, aquarium gets really busy by noon on weekends."
1390,2013-08-22,5,"The famous Monterey Bay Aquarium. Some say it's the country's best aquarium, but instead when I saw the $35 per person price tag to see sea creatures all I could think was about how much fish I could eat with $35. Sorry for my gluttony and idiotic thinking. After cramming the entire aquarium in 1.5 hours I would pay even more than $35 to see this AWESOME exhibit!From Abalone to Sea Otters, they had an amazing variety of living sea life for exhibit, and some to pet. They don't have live whales, but do have an exhibit on whales. If only they could fit the impossible Blue Whale somewhere.My favorite exhibit were the Jellyfishes who had an electrifying sort of calmness going on. There were a list of feeding demonstrations and other activities at the front desk, but if you come after 330PM then you're gonna be out of luck to see any of that.Great place to visit for kids, biology students, biology dates, regular dates, old people dates, and the elder folks!My only regret was I couldn't take a bite out of the Blue Fin Tunas swimming around.."
1391,2017-10-08,3,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium and think it's great for all ages. It's a fantastic experience, especially for young children. I remember going in 4th grade and I never forgot it because of what a great time it was. The only problem I have is it's EXTREMELY expensive. I went again about a year ago and as a young adult I realized how expensive it is for so little."
1392,2016-03-11,4,Really nice aquarium. Definitely the best in Nor Cal. The Deep water Exhibit is the only one in state. The Kids love it we go every year. Here's my only Issue. The pricing. For my 3 year old is 30$ a day. I get that proceeds help conservancy but really? Let's not forget this place is not-4-profit. And they don't openly talk about how much of these proceeds go to conservancy. So it just bugs me a little.
1393,2013-07-30,3,"Solid 3.5 stars.I only have two other large scale aquariums to compare this to, and one of them is the Aquarium of the Pacific. It's very similar, and as much as I appreciate marine life, this aquarium did almost nothing for me. I get that the exhibits are amazing, but it's difficult to observe them when everyone else is around you, bumping into you and trying to get a good look at what you're looking at. I was warm inside so that made it uncomfortable too. I've had an annual membership to the Aquarium of the Pacific twice so I've had my share of exhibits. Nothing at the Monterey Bay Aquarium jumped out at me that made me say, ""OH! THIS is why this is one of the top aquariums in the country, if not the world!!"" I hope the $35 admission goes towards the conservation of the local marine life, because DAMN. Not trying to be cheap here, I just expected a lot more bang for $35. Restaurant closed early and we were super thirsty. Hard to believe there wasn't anywhere else to buy a bottle of water.  We didn't spot a food and beverage stand anywhere so we made do with a lukewarm water fountain.SUPER crowded/busy for a weekend. It's expected. Everyone wants to visit this place. It was pretty great to hear so many languages being spoken in one place.My whole life I've heard about this place, the GREAT Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was ok. I'm glad I finally visited. It's definitely a tourist destination.Parking is awful here. Cannery Row is a tourist trap and I didnt see a specific aquarium parking lot or parking structure so we drove around quite a while.Navigating the entire aquarium was quite a pain. Up...across...back down and across...then up again...go down...go up. Such a nightmare.I loved the observation deck! It was so relaxing and I was able to get away from the crowds and the noise and enjoy peace and quiet while watching sea otters in the bay. Yes. Sea otters were in the bay. I would have taken pics but my phones zoom isn't that great. Aquarium of the Pacific is the same or better than this famed place, for less money. I might have enjoyed the exhibits a lot more if tons of people weren't bumping into me or crowding around. It's hard to enjoy things that way. And, tourists...if you can read English...PLEASE COVER YOUR SNEEZES! That's what tissues, your arm, or anything else is for. Cover. Your. Sneeze. I don't appreciate walking into a torrent of your germs. Thank you."
1394,2016-08-12,5,"I absolutely loved this aquarium! All staff personal were friendly and helpful with any question I had. There were plenty of different creatures to see and even special parts of the building designed for kids entertainment. I believe it was called the splash zone? I particularly enjoyed the touching pool, where I got to touch a little sting ray. The sea otters and jellyfish were also on my list of favorites. I would suggest this to all my friends no matter what their age."
1395,2017-07-05,5,"This aquarium is one of the best reasons to visit Monterey. There is so much marine life to see and learn about, and one can never get bored. Although, the admission rates are a bit steep, this is a great activity to do while in Monterey, as the aquarium offers so much to see, is well maintained, and the staff are friendly and approachable."
1396,2017-07-04,5,Returned here and it was great.  The live host/video shows are really entertaining.  We saw the one on the great white shark and the bay and they were really fun.  Unfortunately the sunfish has passed away.
1397,2014-03-18,3,"I agree with most of the negative comments which is that I think $40 is a bit steep for admission.  That coupled with the $15 parking fee can get quite pricey. BD has been to many aquariums and he says that Monterey is on the small side and not laid out very well.It's a good idea to try to visit on the off days if you're not into crowds. On the weekends it is just super crowded and there's a lot of jostling around to get to the viewings and sometimes you don't get to appreciate the smaller things as you just want to bypass everyone.  I agree with another commenter who said that they'd rather sit and watch HD marine life than fight the crowds. My favorite were the jelly fish, the sea otters, and the large ocean life display with the sharks, schools of fish, and turtles. I was amazed at the size of some of those fish!  I also enjoyed the kid area. My 20 month old really enjoyed playing in the water and jumping around and going down the slide. Also it's nice going outside to take in the view and eat some lunch. Those are the only things that give Monterey Bay the three stars."
1398,2017-08-10,2,The aquarium itself was great.  Lots of sea animals and great location by the ocean. I'm giving them only 2 stars for the crowd. I went on a Monday afternoon and it was disgusting how many people were there.  I had to literally step between 2 women to prevent a fight from happening next to the otter feeding area.  My kids faces were shoved into the glass watching the same otters as people behind us kept on pushing and pushing.   There were exhibits where I could not walk through due to the amount of people there.  I'm not sure when it is a good time to go (will have to do more research if I go back) but my lone experience with this place was not positive.  I'm not sure how some of the exhibits aren't a fire hazard considering the number of people there and exits available.
1399,2017-05-31,4,"Fun and interesting visit, somehow I expected to be more WOWED and that was the missing element. Overall, I would recommend that you go once."
1400,2016-08-09,3,"Minus two stars for the OVERWHELMING crowdedness. SO. MANY.PEOPLE. Some exhibits were not enjoyable or visible due to this. I would strongly suggest they cap the amount of entrants they allow per hour or something. It was terribly pricey, at $190 for a family of 5. We did two tours at the Hearst Castle for all of us for much less. PROS: the otters are awfully fun, and so are the touch pools. You just have to elbow a few other tourists out of the way to really enjoy it all."
1401,2018-06-03,4,"Nothing special,too crowded.Wish they have more spaces for parking .Kids had fun that's the man thing"
1402,2014-02-19,5,"It was my first time here and I got in for free, since it was for local residents and I had my college ID. NOTE: it was a limited time only, this offer is no longer available :(Went in thinking that there would be a wait, but there was not! Immediately went in and walked around and taking loads of photos of fishes, sharks, otters, penguins, underwater plants, frogs, etc. However, my favorite part was the underwater waterfall! It was amazing and felt so real :) Good place to visit, but I'm not sure if I would pay $40 to go again... :("
1403,2016-01-07,5,"This is one of the most beautiful places in the world!  You can certainly go there to learn about the fishes, environment, or even seafood diet, but you don't have to.  You don't have to go there to acquire knowledge.  Instead, you go there to enjoy the atmosphere!  Choose a quiet weekday to avoid the crowd.  Sit in front of the open sea or the jellyfish tank.  Play your favorite music (with headsets, of course).  You'll feel that you're in heaven.  There is truly something spiritual about it.  It's quite a drive from the peninsula, especially on the way back, but it's worth it."
1404,2017-04-12,3,"Went here last weekend, first time in 10 years. I feel Monterey Bay Aquarium is overrated & way over priced. For a family of 4 the cost is pushing $175. I had AAA, they said $2 discount per person, wow big savings. It should be more like $10 discount per person, just $2 is a slap in the face."
1405,2017-04-02,5,"This is an amazing aquarium that offers many options for all ages.  My family and I have been members for 4 years.  My  6 year-old son appreciates sea life because of his experience with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  We can never get tired of the exhibits, documentaries and kid's area.  This is one of our must see places when we have visitors in town.The staff and docents are extremely knowledgeable and we always enjoy speaking with them because we learn something new each time we are there.  There are 4 gift shops in the aquarium.  The main gift shop and kid's gift shop are located on the first floor.  They sell books, souvenir items, snacks and seasonal dinnerware.  Parking is not easy especially during the summer season.  There are several paid parking options in the area.  All the spots are easily within a walking distance."
1406,2017-02-11,5,THE ANIMALS OF THE SEA!!!! I am a year member and I love going here. I saw a turtle grow up from being as small as the palm of your hand to the size of your head. The birds in the exhibits are amaze. Otters are on point. Octopuses here were used for Finding Dory! Favorite thing about this place is the Open Sea. I love jellyfish as they are extremely calming to watch be alive. Go here with your special someone or bring some kids! Make sure you have permission to bring the kids from their parent/guardian cause if not... You just kidnapped a kid. Enjoy your time here!
1407,2015-11-28,5,"Amazing. Park far and walk but you have to bring quarters. Also, Richard from the gift shop is amazing. Go Richard!"
1408,2017-08-28,4,Fun for an hour or two. Go during the week. A little pricey at $50 per person. The touch tanks are fun. And the large tanks with the sharks are great.
1409,2016-08-03,5,"I visit Monterey multiple times a year just because of their aquarium. Being a student, it is not very easy doing so on a tight budget, but after a couple of times I think I have gotten down to a science. Overall, the atmosphere is amazing and the attractions are interesting enough to keep a family busy for more than 3 hours if you decide to visit every single one. My weekend getaway guide and aquarium review can be seen on:taylorphan.com/taylor-ph…"
1410,2016-03-30,4,People say this is the best aquarium in the country. I did get a great front seat and like the view of gigantic fish swimming gracefully within  the 2 floor deep ocean tank. Otter is cute too ! Jelly fish ++
1411,2015-12-29,5,The Monterey Bay aquarium never disappoints. Love that new exhibits and educational presentations are refreshing every time I visit.
1412,2016-06-24,5,"EPIC ! experience from the start great staff, volunteers very clean and just an amazing place. Great for the family and super close the Cannery row so you can make a full day of it.Prices seem high BUT once inside well worth it. The work and care they put into this place shows from beginning to end. THANK YOU Cant wait to go back, we might even take the kids next time"
1413,2015-10-17,5,"This aquarium has some great animals and exhibits! They have 2 precious and playful sea otters, giant turtles, hammerhead sharks, jelly fish, school of fish and a 2 story tank. I would recommend this place. :)"
1414,2017-07-30,5,We got there right at opening which was probably the best idea because it was crazy busy as the day moved forward. My kids had a blast and there are so many hands on options for the little ones. Enjoyed every minute!
1415,2017-06-20,4,"Many people insisted that we go here while in Monterey. The thing is, we have several nice aquariums in southern California. I didn't find Monterey to be more spectacular that say Aquarium of the Pacific in long beach. Monterey did have one fantastic exhibit with a turtle, sun fish and many other fish. The rest of it didn't have anything that Long beach didn't have. It did look good for people with kids, though."
1416,2016-05-17,5,"this place never fails! last time I went here was when I a kid. now coming here as an adult, it's a lot more interesting. learning  how different creatures survive and how they live. the sea life is a WHOLE other world it's amazing. we thought it would just take Less than 2 hours to see the whole place, but we were wrong! we stayed a little over 3 hours with going out to lunch in between aha. this place is worth going to if you've never been. plus if you have kids, it's a great place to take them!!"
1417,2017-07-26,5,"Beautiful, inspirational, exciting, calming, incredible. Absolutely so enjoyable at every turn. Great staff who are knowledgeable and kind. This place will make you feel such a sense of awe and wonder. Prepare to spend all day here, you've got a lot to see!"
1418,2017-07-04,5,Love this aquarium so much we have moved to be near it.  DS wants to be an oceanographer.    We have visited in the U.K. And the US and this is the best.  It has a fantastic educational approach which meets the requirements of all ages and makes learning fun - often without even realizing it
1419,2016-01-06,4,"I hadn't been here in years, and wasn't super excited to go with the kids, but knew they would be, so We went anyway. Well, we went Sunday and I can't wait to go back!  The place was super clean, tons to do and explore. Something there for every age. They have really done a great job there. Every staff member was super nice and overly helpful. I couldn't believe how good the cafe was. It was well stocked and the food was yummy. The only negative I can think of (which was big for us), was that the feedings did not keep the interest of many of the younger kids in there. That was a bit disappointing. But all in all, we will def go back soon."
1420,2016-05-29,4,"Great place. The staff, some probably are volunteers, are fantastic. I really liked the computerized diner education exhibit about sustainable fish. The touch tanks are numerous and fun for the kids. Allocate 2 hours. You can also leave and return the same day if you knee your ticket and I guess a hand stamp. If you have a family and live in San Jose become a member, it's well worth it."
1421,2017-01-29,5,Five stars speak for themselves.. SUCH a cool place! Highly recommend to tourists and the locals. Always a good day here and kind staff.
1422,2016-09-16,5,I highly recommend visiting the Monterey Aquarium! One of the best. We will come back for sure. Parking is a bit challenging though.
1423,2016-01-03,5,"Become a member. It is totally wth it. For a family of 4 it becomes a wash after 2 trips. You are able to get in 30 minutes early and get some other great benefits here and there. This place is just magic. Especially for my 1.5y/o son. He cannot get enough. On top of that, it just helps soothe the mind, just watching how majestic the big tanks and the big fish are!"
1424,2016-07-22,4,Beautiful place with lots to see however for the super expensive price ($50/adult $40/kids) I was a bit disappointed. This place was so crowded it was really hard to enjoy the place. In fact the sea otter habitat was so crowded we could not even see them. We arrived right when it opened and got about 90 minutes before the hoards of people got there. *if you stay at one of participating hotels nearby you get a 2 day ticket which is $10 less per person than a regular one day ticket. My kids had a good time so all in all it was worth it!
1425,2014-08-24,5,"We have been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for many years.  It's as good as any aquarium can be.  The only down side is that too many people visit and it's a bit too crowded.With the annual membership, our family usually arrive at the aquarium quite early, hang out for 2-3 hours and leave when too many people are there.  That way, you can enjoy the sea creatures without fighting with crying babies and frustrated moms.  :)The aquarium is not big.  One can see all the exhibits in 4 hours but that's rushing it.  4 hours won't be enough for all the feeding, hands on exhibits, or enough time to absorb the beauty of the jellies."
1426,2017-09-13,5,"I've been wanting to visit the Aquarium for a long time. I wasn't disappointed. So many things to see and read and hear. The open sea exhibit was amazing! Seeing the swarm of 20,000 sardines feed was awesome. Also the exhibit with the kelp forest was really cool too, among the many species of fish swimming around are 3 giant sea basses, one weighing 250 pounds. Well worth the $50.00"
1427,2016-07-19,4,"Awesome aquarium with things to do for people of all ages.  The place is full of nice large aquariums where the fish seem to have enough space to move freely while still being easy to view.  There are also a few interesting ""experiential"" exhibits that are pretty cool.There are two reasons why I deducted a star:1)  It was pretty crowded when we went (on a Tuesday afternoon).  I would expect it to be even more packed on the weekend.  Apparently, the key is to get there early.  2) It was pricey.  My wife and I were able to use some free passes.  My oldest son got a student discount ($40) and my 10 year got the child rate ($30).  Normal adult tickets are $50.  Also, there are tons of shops in there, so try to avert your kids eyes.3) Cell phone (Verizon) coverage pretty much sucks.  The kids were forced to look at the fish and not collect Pokemon."
1428,2016-04-02,5,Absolutely one of the best aquarium we have visited. The feeding show was awesome. Tho we still believe these sea animals should all be set free. Love the interactions and teaching they provide to public.
1429,2015-05-06,5,"Amazing aquarium, lucky to live so close to it. The otters are fun to watch, and frequently serve as surrogate moms to sea otter pups in their rehabilitation program. They have changing exhibits which keep it interesting for locals. The Open Ocean exhibit is hypnotic, I could watch that all day. Knowledgeable staff and volunteers. We got a membership last year, and we have loved watching the cuttlefish grow! :) (They are not the same ones as when they started. They release them after a few months and start over)We are nature-watchers, so my favorite part is outside. The aquarium is built right on the edge of monterey bay, and if you bring some binoculars you can see some great things. We have seen Peregrine Falcons, wild Otters, and pods of dolphins over a mile long."
1430,2013-09-10,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is really cool, I love the expansive jellyfish exhibit and some of the cool hands on stuff (I think it's geared towards kids. Oops).The thing is, I've had the opportunity to see some really amazing aquariums (ala Atlanta), and for a Bay Area local I think Cal Academy offers a more diverse experience, including Jelly Fish.All in all, the aquarium is a cool experience especially if you haven't seen many, or if you're looking for a specific exhibit they have. For those visiting Monterey from San Francisco, I would say this stop is skip-able if you've been to CAS."
1431,2017-07-16,5,Wow! What an amazing place for the whole family! Me and my kids enjoyed every minute of it. Hard to pick a favorite - but I'll go with the jelly fish. Mesmerizing and beautiful.
1432,2017-03-05,5,Great place to bring girlfriend. Keeps her quiet and looking at puffins. Life is perfect.
1433,2015-12-28,5,"Wow, this is easily the best aquarium I've been to thus far. I originally thought the Baltimore aquarium couldn't be beat, but was proven wrong in the first ten minutes. The exhibits, the atmosphere, and of course the enormous glass wall showing the sharks, tuna, anchovies, sardines, and turtles is always mind blowing. We got the year long pass and go as often as possible."
1434,2014-09-13,5,"Puts any of the aquariums I have ever been to too shame!! This place looks a little dingy from the outside, but is SPECTACULAR inside! Literally a must see if your in the Monterey area... The Octopus and the Open Ocean sections are awesome, VERY entertaining... if you get a chance, watch the feedings in the morning, its really cool. You could spend the entire day here, we were a bit rushed, but were able to see everything but wanted to watch more feedings... Awesome place to go too when your in the Bay Area!"
1435,2017-07-12,5,I have been to aquariums all over the world. This beats them all.  The displays are wonderful. The staff and the volunteers are a joy to talk with. The habitats are so well designed. Everyone should visit this awesome aquarium at least once.
1436,2015-09-09,5,"I have been to a few notable aquariums on a couple of different continents. The ambiance, atmosphere, and the presentation and variety of specimens make the Monterey Bay Aquarium the gold standard and the best I have been to.The highest rating (three stars) in the Michelin Guide denotes that particular establishment is worth traveling from another country to visit. I am not sure if they rate aquariums, but I believe the Monterey Bay Aquarium deserves such a journey."
1437,2017-07-11,5,"First time here, I really enjoyed this Aquarium. Very big inside and had a lot too see and do. One of the best ones I have been too. However, there was just so much people inside of the aquarium. For Adults is $50, Children ages 3-12, is $30. 3 years and younger is Free."
1438,2013-09-09,4,"Busy as ever, breaking busiest records over the holiday weekend. Decided to get the membership card to jump ahead of the lines, though they were moving quite fast. Two visits easily covers membership, so if you're in the area, it's totally worth it. Besides you can skip the lines and go through the side entry, know that your membership goes toward respectable animal support and educational programs, and you get the inside scoop on wine and cheese events! I thought the staff was particularly helpful and very friendly, offering some good advice to avoid the crowds and make the most of your visit. Though I do like the renovations I still miss that circular spiral stairwell with the sardines swimming around you, just the circular tank on the ceiling isn't the same.  The jellyfish have quite the exhibit and the groovy psychedelic section on the bottom floor is interesting- very trippy. The seahorses are such strange creatures, but fun to look at. The educational movies like the rescue of adorable Luna, the sea otter pup is well narrated. Don't forget to stick your hand in the touch tank, you're never too old to be reminded how squishy a sea cucumber feels or how soft a bat ray is- just make sure your sleeves are rolled up, because the ray tanks are fairy deep. One of my favorites is the huge several story tank with the sunfish, hammerheads, surf sharks, and tuna. Much like the kelp beds but much more active. I think Cal Academy has a similar huge wall tank with a fairly dark room to watch the animals swim about. I bet it's mesmerizing on a less crowded day, when you can sit in peace and contemplate life.Though it can get crowded, it's easy to navigate around and still see plenty of the exhibits. The wait lines for the restrooms and the movies weren't terrible and everything was well stocked and fairly clean. I think MBA keeps a smooth running operation, which is great for being such a quintessential part of Monterey bay."
1439,2016-06-16,5,Loved the place. Allow for at least 4 hours to view the whole aquarium because the place is huge maybe a little more depending on how fast your kids move. My visit was on Sunday June 12th and there was a lot of people but not packed to where one couldn't walk. We got to the aquarium around 12:30 and we got to see everything and even had time to go back to take our time and read the things that had interest my family. Overall it was a good experience for both adults and kids. Also great place to take pictures.
1440,2015-07-06,4,"This aquarium is like an exciting horror movie, very exciting and intriguing with shocking sense the first time you see it, but gets boring once you've seen it more than once, and since Im a member of the aquarium I have seen this place more than once, probably been 4-5 time within a year, and I was quite disappointed that within a year of my membership, the exhibits stayed monotonously the same without new updates. Therefore for first timers, it would be very impressive coming to the aquariums and yes its worth the money spent, but it gets boring if your visiting this place again. Despite it being boring, I must applaud the organization for keeping the exhibit clean, and well established and animals are happy and properly cared for, Im a huge aquarium fan, I have 5 aquarium myself including a saltwater tank, so I understand the huge undertaking efforts of managing and maintaining this marvelous aquarium. The size of this aquarium is not huge, it approximately takes 1 -1 and 1/2 hour to cover the entire exhibit. About 95% of the exhibits are indoors, so weather is never a concern. There is so much to learn here about ocean life and I love how the aquarium tries to teach people about sustainable eating. Entrance fee for adults is $40, child $25 and student/senior $35  which is really pricey but worth it if it was your first time, the membership I got was $275 for an entire year and benefits 2 adults, 1 child and 2 extra guest passes. The membership also entitled me 10% discount in all stores in the aquarium and extra showcase like behind the scenes tour. The behind the scenes tour is really awesome, and I would recommend it for anyone, as it has exposed me to learn everything that goes behind the walls of the aquarium and for an aquarium enthusiast this was like heaven. I learned plenty, like how they use sea water from the ocean to fill the aquarium and the octopus escaping and running around the aquarium, its really exciting, I wouldn't want to spoil to much of the behind the scenes, but the tour is definitely worth the price, $15 for non members and $10 for members. The exhibits as I mentioned  is well kept and the design of the aquarium is kept to modern-industrial decor with lots of glasswork, wood work and metal work surrounding every exhibit. The building used to be a cannery, and its impressive how the building elements are still intact. My favorite is the open sea exhibit which is impressive in every way, because its does give a haunting feeling of being in the  middle of the ocean with gigantic bluefin tuna, frightening hammerhead sharks swimming, oddly sunfish and large school of anchovies synchronizing. The jelly experience is fun but not as exciting or intriguing, I thought the Jelly fishes in the open sea exhibit was much more impressive and stunning. The kelp forest was really beautiful, but doesn't offer much shock to me. I would have liked to see an underground tunnel or something impressive and more interactive, like feeding the stingrays, but all of that is absent here. The docents and volunteers here are really helpful and friendly and would gladly talk to you. I would say I was really impressed the first time, but being here 3-4 times, I am now bored, there has not been an exhibit update in a long time and to me a membership is purely wasted. I wouldn't mind the monotonous exhibits if the membership was like $100-$150, but $275 is a lot of money for unexciting exhibits. The membership is great but doesn't have VIP perks, every time I come here, the opening hours are always the same as other people, therefore its not really worth the price paid. Overall a lovely aquarium, and one of the better ones I've been too, just needs more excitement, I'm still a fan though."
1441,2015-12-11,5,"At the beginning you may think it's just a place with fish, well you are wrong! ;) They rich exhibitions and programs. You witness feeding otters and penguins, while listening to staff explaining and telling stories about these specific animals (from which zoo, how old so on). There are many volunteers eager to talk about their furry friends. There is as well really nice and quiet part with allsorts of squids and funny little fish/octopuses. Anyway the most impressive thing there is ocean view, where they have this big ass glass through which you can see sharks, tuna (oh boy how big is this!) and few others just swimming in this really big aquarium. Unfortunately I talked too long with one of volunteers and missed the talk in ocean view part, which seemed really nice (judging by people reaction when it finished).One thing though: if you wanna buy a giftor souvenir do it when you are in. Once you leave Aquarium you can't go to gift stores without buying another ticket."
1442,2013-07-14,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must visit when in Monterey.  After all, it is one of the main attractions down there on Cannery Row.  My parents used to take me down there every so often on short weekend family trips, so I have fond memories of visiting the aquarium.  Seeing all the different sea life makes for a nice day activity for all ages.  My favorites are the jellyfish, sea otters and rarities such as the sea pens and leafy sea dragon.  On my last visit, bf and I got to see the sting ray egg pouches.  It was the neatest thing I ever saw.... the aquarium had them on display with a small window cut out of the pouch.  Inside, you could see the baby sting ray before they hatch.  Tip: Purchase your tickets online and go to will call window to bypass long ticket lines for admission."
1443,2015-06-20,3,"I am an Oklahoma girl now living in the Bay area. I have to brag that for an entirely landlocked state, we have a very impressive aquarium (howdy to Jenks, USA!) that charges half of the admission of the one in Monterey Bay. So, looking at the pricing and the reviews beforehand, I was ready to be blown away.Unfortunately, I just wasn't - especially in comparison to the aquarium back home. A friend told me to expect to spend 3-4 hours there, but I struggled to make it last an hour and a half. However, if I had children with me I feel like it would have been a different story. Nearly half of the exhibits were ""touchable"" and geared toward the kiddos being able to see and feel the various kelps, starfish, ect. The families looked to be having a blast and there wasn't a child in sight that wasn't beaming ear to ear.It's a beautiful aquarium and the exhibits are nicely put together and well spaced out (it gets crowded fast), but just know what you're getting - especially if you're sans little ones."
1444,2017-07-30,4,"As a family we enjoyed the aquarium, especially Open Ocean and Tentacles.  Weekends are very crowded and there is a fair amount of non-living exhibits that really don't count to me as an aquarium exhibit.  Overall really good but didn't capture 5 star."
1445,2017-07-28,5,"The MBA is a formidable exhibit of life in the ocean. All the way from the the rocky tide shores, to the Monterey Bay, down to the deep ocean. My grandkids loved it ll, but especially the hands on areas. Entertaining, educational, and truly delightful."
1446,2016-07-03,5,"Amazing, world class aquarium!Do not miss this if you're visiting the Monterey area!"
1447,2017-08-27,3,"The aquarium was very nice.  Lots to see.  Some of it very beautiful and fascinating.  I was expecting a better tide pool and bigger area for touching sea life.  They don't have big areas for big sea life like sea world or anything.  Once you get through about half of this, it is basically just laid out for children in the second half and boy are there kids!   Got through to the second story and then wanted to get out of there as parents don't control their kids and they are banging on the glass (poor animals)  and running into people and screaming.  This is all about the kids and letting them run all over.  Not extremely fun for adults.  For $50 a person I feel like the adults could have been shown a better time but this place is set up for children."
1448,2015-12-24,5,"Absolutely wonderful!   Enjoy each exhibit and don't rush.   There is a lovely cafe with very reasonable prices that offers a respectable menu...so you don't have to leave to eat.  There's also, plenty of seating areas throughout the aquarium so you can rest up from all the walking...or just sit and leisurely enjoy your favorite exhibit.  There are plenty of docents around to answer questions but the exhibits themselves have most of the information right on the front of the glass.  The special exhibits are just that..special.   They are only shown for a limited time so be sure to make it a point to see them.  We missed the special sea horse exhibit and was crushed.  Right now they are showing Tentacles...and it's a WOW.    You just can't come to Monterey and not visit the aquarium!"
1449,2017-08-27,1,"Some nice exhibits especially the jelly fish and turtles.  Very relaxing if not surrounded by yelling kids and wailing newborn humans. In general kid le probably line this, but if you want a relaxing experience enjoying the natural wonders of the sea without the constant wailing of newborn humans surrounding you this is not the place on a weekend and may not be the place ever.There is no giant glass underwater view of the bay.  Everything is in enclosed aquariums.The price per adult is $50. In my view very poor value for the experience."
1450,2011-05-05,5,"So I'm the 1,031st Yelper to review this elaborate fish tank. What of it? You think I couldn't lend a perspective so individualistic that it will shed new light on a place you think you already know like the back of your dorsal fin? Well, do ya, punk?... OK, you're right. Mine will sound like one of their brochures just like everyone else's, but hey, my two cents are just as good as anyone's.Now understand that my experience with fish is usually accompanied by a little wasabi and ginger, so the sight of seeing them alive and swimming in a tank only makes me hungry for a nice rainbow roll. I'm just sayin'. Regardless, the 28-foot Kelp Forest (see photo) is still quite an impressive sight since it really makes you feel like you're in the middle of an ocean or at least at the bottom of a Marine World tank. A massive school of Pacific sardines somehow manage to swim in unison like a big rotating ball of razor blades (see photo). The Outer Sea was temporarily closed when Jamie W. and I were there last weekend, but the Wave Crash is still operating like clockwork and the Touch Pool is as touchy-feely as ever. The Hot Pink Flamingo exhibit sounds more provocative than it is since the wading birds mostly preen themselves (see photos), but the soft pink of their feathers certainly makes them more appealing than their plastic lawn brethren. The jellies - the glow-in-the-dark moon jellies, the deep pink sea nettle jellyfish - are always a treat if just for their shifting shapes and luminescence under the black lights (see photos). The Magellanic penguins and green sea turtles are quite lively in their large exhibit areas (see photos), although I have to admit seeing the baby penguins flap their small fins so aggressively against the window makes me wonder if it really reflected a failing escape plan. And of course, catching the sea otters do the backstroke makes me envious for their carefree lives (see photo). Lastly, definitely catch the Secret Life of Seahorses exhibit while you can. It displays fifteen different species up close and personal (see photos). It runs until August 2012. Admission is $30, an admittedly steep price, but the surefire quality makes it still worthwhile after 27 years."
1451,2014-10-31,3,"Got up early to get here from Palo Alto, and it was definitely worth it. At 11 am they had a feeding at the Open Sea exhibit. If you want to see this, and have good seating/a good view arrive early. My friend had been here before and knew this, so we scored great seats. The feeding was an excellent show, it's amazing how big that tank is!Overall the aquarium is very educational, with many exhibits. They also have some outdoor areas where you can go out and look at the bay. It is very crowded though, at least it was on a Saturday morning, and the crowd could make it hard to really stop and enjoy the exhibits. It's also pretty pricy, the adult ticket was around $40 and food from the café was insanely expensive. If you're going, I suggest eating beforehand to save money."
1452,2016-03-16,5,"Seriously the best aquarium regardless if you're 10, 15, 25, or 50. They have so many exhibits for you to touch and interact with. If you're lucky you can go outside to the deck and spot some otters. They're the absolute CUTEST!! They have scheduled feedings that you can watch as well but get there early as most likely it will be packed. Got to watch them feed the large tank of giant tunas!! and then they let out the sardines which swirled into a cyclone. SO AMAZING! They're also very informative about our role as humans on the effect of ocean habits and ecosystems. We make a large impact and there are multiple exhibits that illustrate in an understandable way to both children and adults on what we need to do to improve our environment."
1453,2015-07-11,5,"After almost becoming jaded and expecting the worst whenever visiting a ""tourist trap,"" it was awesome to be able to go to the MB Aquarium.  It's a given that the aquarium itself is a beautiful space with amazing animals and exhibits. The aspect that stood out to me just as much as the wonderful exhibits was just how much they emphasize the visitor experience. Some examples:- The staff is amazing, in all areas in the aquarium. Kudos to each of them. Everyone is happy. It sounds weird I know, but it's true. They're on par with Disneyland in terms of friendliest staff. From the lady guiding my daughter in what is to be found in the touch tidepool exhibit to the staff people working the busy eating area, they were all kind and engaging. - The Cafe was great all around. Again, when visiting a tourist haven, I'm expecting poor to average food at an exorbitant price. Here, the food tasted fresh and not mass produced. My wife, who's pretty hard to please, remarked on how great her garden salad was multiple times. - There's a lot to do besides the obvious. If you see a volunteer standing at a table off to the side, walk up to them and see what they're doing. I think a lot of people ignore them, but these are great opportunities to learn something new, ask questions, and chat.- They've made it a great place for kids. We brought our girls, ages 4 and 2 and they had an awesome time. The Splash Zone areas were especially great for the kids to run around, climb, explore, and see things at their own level.I think the only ""con"" of the place, if there is one, is that it can get pretty crowded. That's not their fault obviously, but it can be an issue. Get there early, buy your tix beforehand, and get to the feedings early (if at all), esp. the Open Ocean one. Overall, an incredible place. If we lived closer, I wouldn't hesitate becoming a member. Can't wait to return!"
1454,2015-06-10,4,"It was the Summer of 1990,  that's the last time I  was at the Monterrey Bay Aquarium and boy did that trip start off fun for the parents, I was full of contempt because they were depriving me of being home flirting with boys like all my other friends... but even an adolescent girl with a bad attitude couldn't help but cave when when she witnessed the scenery of Monterey and be fascinated by the sea life and exhibits surrounding her.It's been far to long since I've been , and I have it on my must do list of 2015, I truly recommend everyone go at least once, this Aquarium is well organized, clean and while the crowds (even in 1990) were crazy, it's well worth a little push and pull when you have amazing sites to see.I will update my review soon, I'll be interested to see what my 42 year old self will see differently than the 17 year old brat. :)"
1455,2013-10-30,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must see! If you are in the Monterey area make sure to check this aquarium out. I thought the whole experience was great. We visited the aquarium on a Monday around 12pm and parked a few blocks away for $10.00. There were no long lines, they have a student discount available so make sure to bring your id for a few dollars off admission. My favorite part was the jelly fish exhibit! It was amazing! And our pictures turned out so great. I also loved the touch pond, penguins, and turtles. This a great place to take children."
1456,2014-07-09,4,"Boy is it packed! Love the exhibits:) 40 bucks is a pricy ticket but remember you're helping preserve natural wildlife.Tickets are good for in and outs throughout the day. I recommend skipping the food in the aquarium and grabbing lunch on cannery row. Purchase your tickets through your hotel, you'll avoid the line at the aquarium and hotel tickets are good for two days."
1457,2016-09-13,5,"I highly recommend visiting the Monterey Aquarium especially for those who love the ocean.I LOVE sea otters so naturally they were my favorite part.  I could watch them for hours, and I did.  Feeding the animals was super cool too.Its educational as well as entertaining.  A MUST see at least once, in anyone's lifetime.  Had to get this mug for my 'sea otter' collection."
1458,2014-03-26,4,If you live within a 2 hour drive you should take advantage of the membership. Just make two trips and it pays for itself. We really enjoyed the jelly fish exhibits. Penguin feeding was anti climatic. Go see the puffins they will provide more entertainment. This is truly a beautiful aquarium. It is no wonder it is very crowded on the weekends.
1459,2018-05-27,5,"What can I say, this world famous aquarium is far and away one of the wonders of the west coast! Standing on the back observation decks and watching the whales jump around, the otters playing all day long, the jellyfish forests... just incredible. And no matter how many times I go when you walk into the main aquarium hall and see the sheer size of it my heart jumps. We opted for the yearly family pass. It was already going to be $200 for us to go one day or we could pay a little more ($350) and get 4 season passes and 2 guest passes. We have gone at least once a month since we bought them and taken friends and family that come visit. Money well spent."
1460,2017-09-11,4,The exhibits are good and well set out. There is a fair amount to do and some talks during the day.  The jellyfish and open sea exhibits are great and the information on plastics and  sustainable fishing are eye opening. If you want to watch any of the feeding be prepared to get their early and this would be my only criticism that the viewing for this is not set out great (although they do have scree
1461,2015-06-18,5,"I must begin with a brief background about me as the reviewer. I'm from San Diego, and have frequented the Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I'm an undergrad in Environmental Engineering with a minor in Geology at San Diego State University. It would be understatement to say that Ecology and environmental sciences interest me.That being said, I didn't know what to expect on this visit, I was pleasantly surprised. Although the Birch Aquarium is quaint and educational, Monterey Bay Aquarium is more like an aquarium amusement park with elements of a small zoo. MBA has 2 large floors mostly full of exhibits. I'd highly recommend to come as early as possible in order to find parking and to watch all the feeding programs. You can easily spend at least 3 hours on your own within the aquarium enjoying all the aquarium has to offer. Nerd out.The staff here were very nice and on many occasions they came over to me when I looked lost to see if they can help. This level of service despite the hundreds of other patrons in the aquarium is very impressive."
1462,2016-08-16,4,A little expensive for what you get but overall a very nice place to visit. If you are an adult with no kids don't go on the weekends. Hundreds of children running around unchecked kind of diminishes the experience.
1463,2013-04-02,5,"Blowholes, Shark Sex and Team Zissou. This is my kind of jam... and just a few of the take-aways from a recent visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I came on a Thursday afternoon with my boo, who had never been. At first he scoffed at the $60-something dollar admission I'd so willingly forked over for the two of us, but I quickly turned and reassured, this was worth every penny... and this is coming from a person who won't turn on the heat until it's at or below freezing outside and lives by the 'yellow let it mellow, brown flush it down' law to save mere pennies.First off, that deck out back is the coolest thing, probably ever. There's docent people outside watching the area for wild sea life and they'll lend you out binoculars and tell you where to look while at the same time identifying every species and giving out neat-o insider info on the creatures (literally) at bay. We'd go out scope an animal, head in to explore, go back out see something new, and repeat. On our trip we saw sea otters, sea lions, dolphins and more. It was THE coolest. Team Zissou really knows their stuff.  We saw the big tank feeding and presentation with about 100 little 6-year-olds where we learned how to tell the difference between a boy shark and a girl shark, and just how those parts fit together. It sounds really weird, but it actually wasn't awkward until about an hour later when I realized I'd just witnessed a gross of minors get ""The Talk"" except the big 'F' word in this birds and bees discussion was 'Fins'... no really, that's a big part of it.Loved that you poke the starfish, pet the stingrays and catch the neat-o jellyfish and sea horse exhibits out now. I won't go too far into it because I already broadcast my thoughts on Jellyfish in my review of that exhibit itself, but for real guys, those things are real deal outerspace aliens. Definitely sent here to observe, report and one day take over. It was also really cool to see so many older people working here. Everyone was of retiring age or beyond and they weren't just any old volunteers, they knew so much about everything and were so excited to share. Like, they reminded of me of when kids come home from school with some new information they just learned and are really excited to tell you about it... except, like, 70 years into the future. I'm sure it gets way cray here on the weekends, but if you can find a way to be here during the day, during the week, do it. It's absolutely worth every.red.cent. and then some."
1464,2017-07-13,5,"Monterey is my favorite vacation destination, and MBAQ is a main reason why. I have a membership even though I live on the other side of the country, because I want to support the Aquarium's important conservation, scientific, and educational work. MBAQ is set apart from many other aquariums because it is on the edge of one of the most ecologically important areas in North America. This allows visitors to extend their experience to the outdoors, including the Great Tide Pool and viewing decks from where it's possible to see whales and dolphins and almost guaranteed to see sea otters.The exhibits are well-designed and unique in their focus on the Monterey Bay ecosystem. The Open Sea exhibit is one of the few places in the world where large tuna can be displayed, and also large ocean sunfish (mola mola). The Tentacles exhibit showcases the diversity of octopus and squid -- amazing! The only marine mammals exhibited are sea otters. They have been rescued from the wild and determined to be non-releasable. MBAQ schedules animal presentations throughout the day. They're definitely worth attending (download the app for times and alerts of unscheduled activities). The behind-the-scenes tours and other special programs are also great!I cannot recommend MBAQ highly enough. Yes, it's crowded, especially in high tourist season. It is absolutely worth any wait you might encounter -- and you can reduce that by getting a membership, which will save you money on programs and even on whale-watching trips with Monterey Bay Whale Watch (and presumably others)."
1465,2016-07-12,2,"Overrated. This place is cool if you have little kids but for older adults on date night, it does not work. It becomes annoying with so many people in the summer that they allow in. We are unable to spend more than a minute at each exhibit. It becomes crowded and takes the learning experience away. I wasn't able to take pics with people crowded all over each section. The outside seating was very small for their animal shows/seminars. I felt like I had a better experience at whites pet shop with all the marine life they have to offer. I expected much more considering we are by the bay! Too small for the amount of people they let in. I have to give it to the employees though. Knowledgable, friendly and nice. 50.00 just was not worth it though. I want to try the GA aquarium even more now considering all they have to offer."
1466,2011-05-22,5,"When my coworker found out that we were going to a work conference in Monterey, she immediately bought us tickets to the aquarium.  The Secret Life of Seahorses exhibit is interesting, informative and down right delightful.  That is where we spent the majority of our afternoon and I had a great time practicing taking photos in low light. The otters and penguins were entertaining, as per usual.  There are some neat live shows including engaging 15-minute lectures in the theater.  I really like the major focus throughout the aquarium on strategies to lesson our negative impact on the environment, including fun, interactive displays.  If you can, I recommended visiting during an ""off"" time to avoid the crowds.  We were there on a Monday afternoon and although it was far from empty, we were able to roam the exhibits with little concern of being run into by small children or run over by rogue strollers.  You can get your hand stamped for in and out privileges.  This is a must stop during a trip to Monterey."
1467,2017-07-11,4,"The admittance is expensive but you have to think that you are helping to maintain all those animals and exhibits.  Absolutely the best Aquarium I've ever been to.  The exhibits are great and I loved all the interactive things for kids.  Lots of touch pools etc.  Tons of friendly and helpful staff.  However there are SO many people that you are constantly dodging people and kids and strollers.  So many people, that it makes it difficult to get up close to the exhibits.  In fact we tried to go to the penguin and otter feedings and it was like 15 to 20 deep, and impossible to see anything.  So we waiting till the crowd dissipated and returned to the exhibit.  Super cool was to see the giant octopus swim from one side of his case to the other.  He is super active and cool.  The jellyfish exhibits are cool.  Loved watching the otters.  They are so cute.  The cafe has awesome food.  I visited the aquarium 22 years ago and don't have much memory of that trip.  But I very much enjoyed my return visit this time.  Tip.  Get your tickets a head of the time to be able to get in quickly."
1468,2015-11-23,5,"Walking into this aquarium brings back so many memories from when I was a kid. I used to visit this place for school field trips and with the family and always had a great time. Now, being older I've gained a higher appreciation for the whole other world in the ocean. My boyfriend and I became members of the aquarium and have come back at least four times since we signed up. Yes, this place gets busy during the weekends - what can you expect? So we pretty much make the trip an entire day thing. We watch a couple of their short films in the morning, go grab lunch in Cannery Row (they have a couple of good bars in the area!), and then head back into the aquarium for the early evening time. Thats when many of the families have left and you can get free reign to walk around and enjoy the exhibits.They have a few parking garages in the area. And it's best to get here early, so you don't have to battle for parking. Another good thing to make note of is that you get in and out privileges at the aquarium - just make sure you get a stamp before you leave!"
1469,2015-11-09,5,SO MUCH FUN! I highly recommend going. It feels so up close to the animals and I would be highly surprised if somebody didn't enjoy their time here.
1470,2015-11-26,5,"I love this place!! I will continue to bring my kids here year after year. I recommend the ""Behind the Scenes"" tour at least one time. For $15 they take you in the back of the tanks and on the rooftop where you can see the top of the popular Kelp Forest tank. They explain the history of the aquarium and how they manage various exhibits. If you like having fun and learning new things at the same time, this aquarium is definitely worth it!!"
1471,2013-05-14,5,"I have been to dozens of aquariums.  I've been to the amazing Atlantis Paradise Aquarium and I've been to the tiny, field trip Coney Island Aquarium.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium is up there as one of the most breathtaking I've seen.If I lived in the proximity of this enormous place, I would certainly be a member.  I don't even think I was able to see every exhibit.  It was a whirlwind of sights and sounds.  My son, only a baby, had a blast looking at the jellyfish and gigantic exhibits.  His favorite was the swirling tube of sardines.  My favorite was their collection of sea horses and their interactive ""Seafood Diner"" of responsible fish eating.On top of endless exhibits of underwater sea creatures, there are art exhibits and lots of learning tools.  This is an excellent choice for children where they can spend the day and have endless amounts of fun.  Lots of things are touch-friendly and interactive.  There are even play areas for the little ones.Parking was a little of a hassle but we found meter street parking not a block away.  We were there almost at opening.Overall, plan to spend at least 3 hours or more here.  I think we spent 5.  There is just too much to see and the price is high enough that you'll want to get your money's worth."
1472,2014-05-10,4,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon from the South Bay are. Not too much traffic but the road can get windy so be careful.Pro: huge! There is a variety of exhibits for everyone. The staff is extremely knowledgable and passionate about sea life. They are friendly and approachable and willing to answer questions. Must see exhibits: jellyfish exhibit, otters (well trained), and the super strange looking sunfish!Cons: aquarium is a little dated looking. Pipes showing everywhere. Crowded (on weekends). A little pricey for a ticket. Tip: if you're a student make sure you bring your student ID for a discount."
1473,2017-07-08,5,"Very nice aquarium and family trip. There are a lot of exhibits and hands on stations. The staff are very friendly and engaging. There were a lot of ppl there but it never felt crowded. The jellyfish, octopus and deep sea exhibits were a big hit for us. Parking is tough to find and expensive. The surrounding area is fun with lots of shops and restaurants."
1474,2016-06-13,5,Came here a year ago but wanna write a review on it! I had a wonderful stay at a very beautiful hotel here and the main reason why I came was for the aquarium! It is really nice and has a great variety of many things. I truly love aquariums so I can appreciate it a lot more than others probably do! My baby nephew also truly enjoyed it. It's well worth your money people!
1475,2016-11-19,5,I've been to this place when I was in elementary school for field trips and for family adventures. I recently went back after winning two tickets on the radio. It was still out of this world each time and there is so much to learn and see. I LOVED seeing the otters and basically spent my time circling that area. It is a bit expensive but I definitely think its worth it. It's also a great place for photos.
1476,2014-01-03,4,"My goal in life is to visit every single Aquarium across the US one day, and Monterey was on my list! I've actually been to Monterey Aquarium about 4 times now, but every time is as exciting as the last. They are forever changing and improving, adding new exhibits and perfecting old ones to make your experience a great one.Being a huge Seahorse enthusiast, I'm a little disappointed they got rid of the Seahorse exhibit, however you can still find them in the ""Splash Zone"", aka kids area. The Jellyfish Experience is pretty awesome, and if you're lucky, you might be able to see the Octopus moving around and being active! The variety of exhibits and animals they have are endless and the tanks are huge! You can definitely see sharks, rays, all types of small and big fish with lots of information to show and very educated volunteers to tell you about all the wonderful things of the sea. They offer an auditorium for movies and documentaries about the sea and are constantly teaching us how to conserve.Located on the very busy Cannery Row, you must find paid parking in lots or along the street. It can get very busy, so definitely plan ahead of time. Tickets are about 35.00."
1477,2016-03-20,4,"Love the MB Aquarium, of course! What's not to love? We'll get to that in a minute, but -This is a world class aquarium, one of the very best anywhere. State of the art exhibits, a few changing every 1-2 years. Huge, impressive viewing areas (kelp forest, deep sea) as well as small and hands-on for the kids, and in between (sea otters, anyone). Education and conservation are the main emphasis here, which is great. You can learn a lot.My favorites? The otters (of course) and the jellies (I still mourn the large jellies special exhibit that is no more), but I also love to sit and watch the open sea, and the area with the sea/shore birds. With some ""special exhibits"" they seem to have few live specimens to work with and lots of video of what they don't have. I don't get that, and always feel a bit cheated when they do it. The conservation vids are nice for kids, but they shouldn't make up 40% of the exhibit.But - whoa it is busy, any day of the week, any time of year. If you come during the week to miss the crowds - haha! It is full of hordes of school trip kids, making lots of noise and ruining lots of photo ops. Of course, little ones with their parents do this too. If you come during the summer it will be summer camp kids. If you are an adult without kids who would love to view the exhibits without the chaos of kids, you are largely out of luck. There are a few member early mornings (when people probably bring kids anyway) and member evenings, but I don't think I've seen any ""Adults Only"" times that weren't fundraisers or more formal reception-type things. Lots of adults would really appreciate some no-kids time, believe me."
1478,2017-07-04,4,Nice place to take your family out but kind of pricey I think. We went on a Sunday and I think it was a mistake because it was so crowded. If we do ever go again it will be on a weekday.
1479,2013-08-22,5,I haven't been back here since the heady dot com days where a reception was held at the aquarium.  This is a great place for kids - much better than Steinehart in SF which I found a tad claustrophobic.   We particularly enjoyed the jellyfish and seahorses.   The faux cafe was a bit preachy but I liked the autographed celeb photos.Great place for a short family vacation!
1480,2016-02-17,5,"I have always loved this place. I love that you can bring your own food in, I love the super friendly staff, I love that there's so much to look at but you never feel overwhelmed.  I love that there's access to outside areas to chill out and plenty of benches inside to stop and rest your feet.  One thing though- do not bring  food outside unless you want it literally ripped out of your hands by aggressive seagulls. Staff actually is out there to discourage people from snacking outside for this very reason, trust me, it's for your protection.  I feel so lucky that this aquarium is so close to where I live."
1481,2013-04-21,5,"Visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium rehashed my childhood dreams of being a marine biologist. I have fond memories of my elementary school field trips to this aquarium and coming back as an adult (dude, I'm old), the magic has never left!I love aquariums and this is my all-time favorite aquarium! The exhibits and shows are wonderful and very educational. There are more kiddie attractions but I can't complain, kids should fall in love with the ocean! It's a completely different world! The aquarium itself is quite big and there are two stories. I did find it a bit confusing navigating through it but I had lots of fun at the touch pools and sea otter sightings. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is situated in a gorgeous and breathtaking location. I remember the walk from our car to the aquarium was simply beautiful, especially with the blue skies and white waves in the background. The aquarium is near Cannery Row and 17 Mile Drive, also great spots to check out! Parking can be expensive at the Cannery Row Parking Garage. However, there is free parking if you go further down Ocean View Blvd. There is FREE all day street parking after the parking signs end. The walk to the aquarium is about 10 minutes on the recreational trail. The coastal views, the fresh air, and sea lion spottings are the perfect pre-show to the Monterey Bay Aquarium!Also, if you are planning a lovely vacation getaway with your special someone, the aquarium has a special hotel package: montereybayaquarium.org/… My boyfriend and I was able to find a hotel that offered packages combining lodging and admission tickets valid for two consecutive days. You basically pay the price of one ticket for two days' admission. Super affordable and romantic!"
1482,2016-08-04,5,I love this place! My fave aquarium so far. Me and my bf got there early to avoid the crowd and enjoy the place without squeezing with other people to take pictures.
1483,2017-08-04,5,Fantastic place to visit. Must see the feeding show at the main tank. Jelly fish exhibit is awesome.Fairly crowded but manageable.This is a must see when in Monterrey.
1484,2017-08-03,5,"AMAZING!  My wife and I came about 10 years ago before kids and we loved it.  Now we have two young children under 7 years old and we enjoyed the aquarium so much more with them.  The aquarium is simply amazing.  Pro tip:  Park on the street across from the parking garage.  We paid 7 dollars instead of 15.  We went on a Saturday but got there right when it opened.  It felt like we had the place to ourselves the first hour but it filled up very quickly after that.  We wanted to see the feeding in the Open Sea Tank, which started at 10:00.  We got our seats at 9:30 and thank goodness we did.  The whole area filled up very quickly.  The kids got tired about lunch time so we left about 1:00.  We ended up taking the FREE trolley to Alvarado St. Brewery downtown for lunch and taking it back to the car.  We had an all around wonderful time in Monterey. Can't wait to come back."
1485,2016-07-02,5,"We had a great time there. We were able to purchase our ticket from our hotel, which was extremely convenient. Because of that, we didn't have to wait as long to get in. We also got a nice discount. The aquarium has something for 4yrs and up. I don't really know how well a, 4 yr old, will appreciate what they are looking at, but the parents seem to enjoy well enough.  I love that fact that this aquarium didn't feel like a commercial. It really seem to be geared towards education and conservation. I recommend this aquarium to everyone."
1486,2014-09-13,5,"We had a wonderful day here. It is truly a world-class aquarium.Tip: For the best experience of the Open Sea feeding event, arrive 30 minutes early and grab a front row seat on the upper level. It's well worth the wait, and you won't regret waiting those few extra minutes to ensure that your viewing is as comfortable and as unimpeded as possible."
1487,2015-07-08,4,"We recently visited this lovely attraction with our 2-year old. I'm amazed at how well kept it is. I expected it to be aged given how long it's been around, but quite to the contrary, they appear to be using the ticket price to keep everything in top form. We greatly enjoyed ourselves and were able to totally wear our toddler out in a happy, healthy manner. I'm sure we'll be back as she gets older as well!"
1488,2014-03-29,4,"This place is absolutely beautiful. But how can you build a multi million dollar aquarium on the beach and not have it be beautiful? I was extremely turned off by the pricing when we looked it up before the trip down there, but the fact that it was pouring down rain when we landed in Cali made me willing to pay $35 to get out of the rain and still be able to see the ocean. There is so much to see in here, but it can be extremely overcrowded when there's field trips and people from all over the world visiting on a rainy day. We were able to maneuver our way around and see the attractions, but the ocean views were what made me love this place. There are about 4 observation decks where you can see the beach and each one gives you a little slice of the same view but throw it all together and, drool. So gorgeous. The jellyfish were my favorite part. They have all different kinds to view and see and the exhibit space is really pretty. Overall it's definitely worth paying once to get in. I can't say it's something I would do again (unless I lived there, I would totally buy a membership), but it's worth a one time trip!"
1489,2016-09-19,5,"This is the best aquarium in the whole of California, or maybe even the country. The staff is friendly and always ready to answer questions. The variety is huge. It's clean and well maintained. My favorites are the jellyfish and the massive tank The best part is the cafe- it's gourmet food! Membership is a great option for locals with kids."
1490,2017-01-10,4,"I used to really like the aquarium, but the price has gone up and there are less exhibits.  Reading something on the wall does not constitute an exhibit.  They are leaning more to teaching children from the schools about not eating certain seafood and how to save our oceans and less actually fun aquarium critters.  Very expensive for the average Joe."
1491,2015-10-23,5,"This is one top notch aquarium!  The hefty admission price set my expectations rather high but they were met.  There are many, many amazing exhibits.  It's hard to feature just a few!  The floor to ceiling aquariums were gorgeous, the sardine tank and jelly fish tanks were mesmerizing, and the sea otters are as cute as it gets! This aquarium is also really neat because they have something for every age level.  I also love how the aquariums mission of preservation and sustainability is not just a marketing ploy. It's not like Sea World where you question the existence of the business (e.g. money or education). In the cafeteria, for example, you wont find any disposable plastic and the only fish served is sustainable.  Did you know? The water in the tanks is fresh from the ocean.  Go all the way to the 4th floor to learn more.So you know - don't plan on finding free parking.  You may have a shot if you look south of the aquarium and plan to walk quite a ways."
1492,2017-06-28,4,"Probably the number 1 destination/activity on the Monterey Peninsula.  Great exhibits and friendly staff.  The only drawback is the number of people that are allowed in at any one time.  Off peak hours are fine, but at the height of the tourist season and mid day, forget about it."
1493,2015-05-09,4,"I *loved* the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I had been begging to take the trip down here for years, since it's just a bit of a drive from San Francisco. We finally made the trip this January, and it was everything I had hoped for!The sea otters were adorable. Even the octopus was incredibly active, moving around & posing for pictures! (It's so hard to see an octopus that isn't hiding or sleeping, so I was really happy.) The giant sea tank was overwhelmingly amazing -- I probably could have sat there for hours! The school of fish in there is the BEST. The actual feeding show at the big tank was a bit uneventful, because I think the big guys had already eaten so it was only the little ones who were hungry.The staff is so friendly. We wandered over to one of the touch tanks, but I was standing back, because I wanted the kids to get first dibs. An employee saw me watching, and called me over & held up a few items for me to touch while explaining them to me. So nice!My only complaint is that we visited on a weekend -- a HOLIDAY weekend. I know, I know. Amateur hour, Jo! But there was still so much to see and do, I can't imagine why you would ever pass up a chance to come here. It's really great."
1494,2017-05-14,5,"Amazing experience, would come back in a heartbeat. Make sure you spend lots of time here! The jellyfish are out of this world, the otters are adorable, and the kelp is just about the best thing ever."
1495,2011-06-02,5,"I've been going here since I was a pup!  No matter how many times I go, even as an adult, it never really gets old.  There is ALWAYS something new I'll notice, explore, learn, etc.  This is truly an amazing aquarium.  Awesome for any age.  There is a great area for toddlers to learn.  Very kid friendly throughout.  I have spent hours here with even the most hyper kid.  There are plenty of hands on opportunities too so you can feel some sea life you'd never ever imagine touching.  So many learning opportunities first hand!  If you are a real reader/observer/learner and are coming solo, you could easily spend a whole day here in my opinion.  The pricing is totally reasonable.  Most people would spend more on their weekly junk food intake than a trip here.  Totally worth it, and totally worth it to support the facility and the opportunity to touch countless lives.The area is pretty cool.  For those visiting Monterey, this is a nice little slice of history with plenty of local shops and restaurants to visit at the same time.  Support the community.Not tons of parking close(especially on the weekend) so be prepared to walk a few blocks.  Bring comfy shoes because you'll walk a lot in the aquarium as well.  Be green, be nice, and be patient with the little ones."
1496,2017-08-21,5,Yes it's pricey. But they don't have competition. If it were more reasonably priced? we would go back more. As it is now we might go back every 7-10 years if it's in the budget.
1497,2011-08-03,3,"There are only two negative things about this aquarium. One is that there is almost TOO much awesome stuff to see in one day, and you get tired of walking around before you've seen everything.  And if you're only in Monterey for the day, every second you spend in the MBA is a second you are missing out on at multiple other Cannery Row locations that deserve your attention.Two: An aquarium volunteer asked us to move after we had waited 25 minutes for the kelp forest feeding show so some elderly women could sit down. We had purposely arrived early to get a good seat. Lesson in customer service, MBA!  I think a better way to deal with that is to a) ask the elderly to arrive early for the shows or b) have an employee (or a rope) save some seats for the elderly and disabled.But it is still a very impressive aquarium all around - some creative minds work in this organization!  Top 5 things:5. Variety of environments - tidepools, beach and water birds, reefs, open ocean, deep sea, wharf and shore creatures like worms and blennies (a personal favorite - fish that latch onto rocks and can jump)4. Shows - Feedings (penguins, kelp forest, otters) are very interesting, thought you need to arrive 30 minutes early to get a good seat.  The volunteers who 'host' the shoes are well-informed and funny, mixing the comical and serious just right.3. Special Effects - Circular tanks for the schools of fish, lighting in the jellyfish exhibit, simulated tides in the kelp forest tank, the wave machine in the beach birds tanks, and the 2 tanks that shoots water over a glass tunnel. These are creative ways to experience an aquarium.2. Interactive exhibits - Especially for kids, but the touching pools for starfish and cucumbers and the larger one for rays really make the visit special.1. The school of fish in the kelp forest tank.  I could watch them for hours swim around in a circle and get confused and lost and then start a parade again.  Great decision to add those to the kelp forest."
1498,2017-07-25,4,"I came on a Friday and it was extremely busy, still it was very fun and we got to see lots of fish and even pet a sting ray."
1499,2017-07-25,3,"Expensive, super- crowded. Past a certain point there are just too many people, to actually be able to enjoy the exhibits. They really need a timed ticket system for the summer tourist months. Good exhibits, maybe overkill on the environmental stuff. But I thought the Georgia Aquarium was a  much better take in."
1500,2016-11-26,4,"A little over crowded today, but neat spit to go. Enjoyed the open ocean and feeding time."
1501,2017-07-23,5,Im a local and have been coming to this aquarium since I was a little kid. This aquarium is well kept and never ceases to amaze whether at the kids zone to the open ocean it's all great! Very kid friendly but very informative for adults as well. I e been to a few other aquariums and this is one you d ont want to miss if you're in the area. The restaurant is a wonderful as well and the seating has ocean views!
1502,2017-07-23,5,"This is a wonderful aquarium and a great place to take kids/family. I've been only twice and both times were on school fieldtrips (I was working), so I have not been able to fully explore all of its wonders. I've been to other aquariums and this one is definitely top notch with lots to explore. I cant wait to go again...without students :)"
1503,2017-06-21,5,What a super place!  We've been there many times and each visit as more enjoyable than the last.  The sea life at the Aquarium are beautiful and we can get up and close to them. My favorite is the touch tank.
1504,2016-01-22,5,"I remember coming here as a kid, and coming back years later, I was really impressed! This aquarium has always been excellent, but it's only gotten better with time. All of the feeding and movies have excellent narration and commentary, and the exhibits are clean, well kept, and seem large enough to keep all of the animals happy! They also do a great job of educating visitors about the ecosystems as well as what fish are better to eat than others. We particularly enjoyed the open ocean feeding, and we were lucky enough to be there on a day with a penguin walk which I think they said they do once every couple of months. Overall, beautiful facility and fun for all!"
1505,2017-06-20,4,"Go here as often as y can afford to.  Take your kids, your grandkids, your nieces, your nephews, your brothers, your sisters, all your out of town visitors, and most of all take yourself over and over again.  There's always something new to see and rarely is there enough time to see everything there is to see.  It's a delight for the eyes, the ears, the sense of touch and well, even to the sense of smell.  If not a delight to the sense of smell, at least an adventure.  Oh the beautiful things you will see(neon colors of sea anemones and sea jellies), the precious things you will see (baby otters feeding), the overwhelming things you will see - sleek sharks racing past the glass, sting rays elegantly fluttering from the tank bottom.  It's like a ten ring circus with magnificent happenings going on in every ring almost simultaneously so that it's difficult to know where to focus your attention at any given time.  Thankfully the staff at the Aquarium have devised scheduled ""shows"" at different focus areas that repeat a few times each day to help you see, feel and hear some of the most notable features of the creatures that live at or visit the Aquarium.  There is also a gift shop that sells the most exquisite items representative of the sea creatures you see at the Aquarium.  All in all it is a highly engaging learning experience albeit a somewhat expensive one.  There is a cafe on site but I would recommend getting your hand stamped so you can leave the Aquarium and return without having to pay admission again because the cafe, like everything else, is expensive and only of middling quality food.  I mean it when I say you should go every year at least twice.  Go as often as you can and really enjoy it.  If you want to save money, move to Monterey and become a volunteer at the Aquarium and then you can get reduced priced admission."
1506,2017-03-04,5,Many varieties! This is by far the best aquarium we've been to. There's also an auditorium where they have shows on the projects. Both kids and adults learn a lot here.
1507,2013-06-09,5,"I can see why this is considered the #1 aquarium in the USA. I realize it's expensive, but hey people, it's REALLY expensive to maintain aquariums! Your ticket goes towards phenomenal exhibits, including the sea otter exhibit, huge shark/sea salt tank, jelly fish exhibits (this is my fav of all of them!), bird exhibits, and overall, an amazing experience. The cons: screaming kids everywhere (expected)The pros: huge, able to explore everywhere, outside sitting area for getting away from screaming and eating your picnic lunch or cafe lunch, incredible lighting of the jellyfish exhibits. Another huge pro? The ticket that I bought through the hotel attached (Intercontinental) lets you go back twice within a 24 hour period! Two visits on my trip for the price of one! Woo hoo!Two thumbs up. I'd go back in a heartbeat!"
1508,2017-07-19,5,"Great place for kids over 2. Great place for a first date ! An absolute must for families visiting the area. We suggest getting there early, have your hand stamped to allow for same day return, have lunch at a local spot, then go back for more in the afternoon.If you might go a second time within a year, consider becoming a member to save a few dollars."
1509,2015-04-05,2,My boyfriend and I went here yesterday for my birthday. I thought it would be a fun thing to do while we were in monterey. I was wrong. It was sooooo crowded! We could barely see any animals since there were so many people in front of every display. We paid $10 for parking and $80 for tickets. It was not worth it at all. Of course they don't do refunds which is ridiculous considering the fact that we didn't get to see anything. We stayed for about 30 mins and left because it was way too crowded and there were children bumping in to us every step we took.
1510,2016-02-27,5,"This place is such an amazing place to visit, I'm not sure that it even needs a review. This is one of the best aquariums in the world.. I'm not sure that I have been to a better one, but you never know what is out there. - Do buy tickets through AAA, they give a bit of as discount.- Do park in street parking, there are some 4 hours spots that are a good price. - Don't eat there, there are tons of places to eat on Cannery Row (Do make a reservation for such a place)- Come early, the best way to visit its to be one of the first through the door, then you can hity lunch  and come back!"
1511,2011-08-14,5,"5 stars does not do this place justice. The quality of the displays and the astounding array of animals will take your breath away. If you are an aquatic hobbyist, this is your mecca.Saturday night sleepovers are definitely worth the money. Nothing will ever compare to waking up next to a mola mola."
1512,2016-07-15,5,"Must see. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a world class facility, with great exhibits and shows."
1513,2016-05-19,5,My husband and I took a weekend trip to Monterey so of course we have to go to the aquarium. This was the first time I have been to Monterey. I absolutely loved the aquarium. It was beautiful. When you go you have to check out the jellyfish. That was our favorite part. This place is great if you have kids and also if you are just going with your partner. They have a cafe you can eat at and a gift shop if you want to bring something home with you. They having a lot of people working here which was a big help. They were so friendly and helpful.
1514,2014-01-04,4,"I'm kind of an ocean/sea/aquarium junkie.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a fun little place to go to take in some wonderful sea life.We went when the baby Great White was there and it truly was a sight to see!I'm always a little saddened by the smallness of the thanks and the sheer massive sizes of some of the creatures, but I can't say it's not wonderful to see them.The have an area where you can touch starfish, kelp, and other such animals. It kind weirds you out at first, but it's something nice for the kids to try.My favorite animals are penguins and the exhibit is closer to the ""Splash Zone"" I believe. But they have quite a few penguins and even a cute little eggshell you can take pictures it. I wish they would upkeep the penguins area more. It's super dirty every time I'm there.Other than that, it's very fun and a good educational spot for little kids to go and even for adults to learn about conservation and the important of our oceans."
1515,2014-01-03,4,"I went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium a couple of years ago after having not been there for over a decade, and was surprised that it was much smaller than I remembered. However, I still had a good time seeing the various aquarium life, although I thought the pricetag was a bit steep. When my friend invited me to go with her and her nieces recently, I hesitated since I thought I would be bored and didn't want to waste money. I ended up biting the bullet and going with them anyway, and paying the $34.95 they charge for Adults. Students get a slight discount and only have to pay $31.95, so make sure you bring your ID if you're a student!Their special exhibit right now is the Jellies Experience, which is great since I love jellyfish. Most of the other exhibits didn't change, but I was surprised to see that there were some different exhibits, such as the puffins (yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…). However, my favorite exhibit was of the Blubber Jellies (yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…). I wish that they had less informational displays and more with actual animals. It would also be cool if they had feedings of the animals that you could watch, like of the otters. I know that you can pay more (between $8 - $12/person) for additional private tours, but it would be nice if they incorporated some extras as part of the regular ticket price. They should also beef up the area where you can touch different sealife, since there seemed to be more empty shells than starfish and other living creatures. Although I still had a good time this visit, I don't feel compelled to return anytime soon for the price, especially because it gets so crowded that it's difficult to see the exhibits clearly. There are a lot of kids running around in the afternoon, so come early if you want to avoid the crowds and having to wait to be able to see each exhibit clearly. Despite the price and the crowds, the aquarium is definitely worth a visit if you haven't been in a while! Parking is available in paid lots, but you can find street parking on Cannery Row as well."
1516,2013-12-31,4,"Pricey. Ask for student or military discounts if you are eligible. (also applicable to the gift shop)Have always been a fan of this aquarium and was glad to have a reason to make the trek down to Monterey with my wife and nephew to check it out. It had been over 10 years since my last visit and it really seems to have improved.Tip: avoid the gift shop, you can by the same souvenirs in the surrounding stores for less."
1517,2013-06-15,5,"I do not have anything terrible to say about the Aquarium. It's beautiful, I cannot believe my gorgeous state of California has such a beautiful aquarium! I thoroughly enjoyed not only the Kelp Forrest but also the Jelly Fish exhibit! It's hard to believe that tiny little see through creatures can inflict such pain and even death! My gosh! I do have to say that the parking situation sucks...I paid 20$ to park two blocks away just because I was so tired of driving around looking for metered parking and I had to also fight the urge to run people over. I definitely suggest maybe coming on a weekday? I went on a Saturday an holy people lol."
1518,2017-07-11,2,"OK, but expensive ($100 for two) and very crowded (go later in the day).  The jellyfish are the best."
1519,2015-11-01,5,This is a profoundly important institution. The staff are the guardians of the ocean. The exhibits are thoughtful and breathtaking. The jellyfish area is other worldly. The deep ocean tank gives you an appreciation for the vastness that is the sea. The otters are terminally cute - and you learn the Pivital animal for maintaining the great kelp beds. (the population is only 3000 in the wild- Hunted to within 30 animals of extinction - so very susceptible to disease as the 3000 are all from those last 30). Give generously when you go there. The ocean is the key to all life.
1520,2017-01-11,5,My favorite aquarium and it it's located in my favorite city.  Great exhibits and everyone is quite knowledgeable.  You can not go wrong with a visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
1521,2014-04-10,4,"AMAZING. What a well put-together aquarium! The open ocean section with the jellyfish was my favorite. Jellyfish are so beautiful! I even ran into one of the marine biologists carrying around baby moon jellyfish in a small container. The otters were so adorable, but the cutest animal there was the baby Logger Head Turtle (see photo). He is part of a rehabilitation program and will be released into the wild where he was found when he grows up. The aquarium has food courts, plenty of gift shops, live displays, touching displays, and plenty of kids areas. We got in with member ""guest"" passes. Basically our friends have a membership and got two free guest passes. The cool part is our friends didn't have to be with us for us to use their guest passes. I couldn't give 5-stars for a few reasons. They have animal exhibits and explain about rehabilitating the animals (like otters) but go on to say they can't be re-introduced into the wild. Why? Also, some of the animals seem pretty large to be in tanks. I would like to know how the size of the tank affects the animals like sunfish, octopus, tunas, and sharks."
1522,2013-04-03,5,"Place gets 5 stars from me out of sheer nostalgia. Believe it or not, I used to sing Christmas concerts here in high school. But it is also the best aquarium I've ever been to. There is a reason why it is so famous. Large, wonderful displays, beautiful setting. Kids loved it. Plus, it really is the only interesting thing in Monterey (aside from the ocean)."
1523,2017-03-19,5,"Yes, it's 5 stars.  It's super large BUT extremely hard to navigate, even with the map they provide you.  Tons of stuff you can see and all super up close.  We went on a March wednesday morning, and kids were still EVERYWHERE so be prepared.  And yes, it's worth the $50 per person admission."
1524,2017-03-02,5,"Amazing aquarium, we really enjoyed our day there. Plan to spend few hours here, since there's so much to see. First thing, there's 2 places where you can find parking easily, first it's the parking garage that is a block down from the aquarium, and than there's the parking lot which gets full super quickly because it's right next to the aquarium. We ended up parking in the parking garage and it only costs us $10 for the entire day. Walking towards the aquarium you will see plenty of small shops, cafe, and restaurants in between. The aquarium itself was pretty amazing, and if your a student then bring your college or school ID for a discounted price. There's 2 places to eat there, the cafe and a restaurant. We ate at the cafe and the prices were unreasonably expensive. I had tried their chicken pot pie which does not a have crust but only chicken, peas, carrots and topped off with crusted cheese. I would suggest bringing your own food or going out to eat somewhere else as you will get more food, and won't be paying double the price for it. They can give you a stamp so that you can leave and come back to the aquarium. Employees are pretty friendly and we met many who were willing to educate and give us a little history about the animals who lived there. They have saltwater fishes, plenty of fresh waters, otters, many types of jelly fishes, and penguins. Also was given a flyers and times regarding when they will have shows, I unfortunately missed it but my family enjoyed the penguins. Overall, a great place."
1525,2017-06-05,5,Excellent customer service... beautiful facility and lots of natural beauty. This place is a must go for all tourists. My kids also love it.
1526,2013-06-14,5,"I'll keep it short since there is SOOOOO many reviews.  Amazing employees, amazing aquarium displays, amazing grounds.  That about sums it up.  I can't really think of any negatives for this place.  By far my families favorite aquarium we've ever visited.  Remember to save your ticket stubs - if you go twice you can use the tickets for an aquarium membership.You rock Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
1527,2016-07-06,5,"Been to this aquarium twice with my wife, and we love it! A few years ago the otter exhibit wasn't open (my wife's fave) but this year it was and it did not disappoint! The new tentacles exhibit was cool, as were the 15 minute information sessions held by researchers at the aquarium. We watched Luna's Story (a baby otter they rescued) and The Great White Shark presentation (about the Shark's role in the ocean and its mysterious behavior). Both were informational, engaging and really showed us the importance of the aquarium's research efforts!I love the outdoor decks overlooking the bay and the ever changing exhibits. The layout is easy and the gift shops are always fun. It's in the heart of Cannery Row and a good half day adventure! We will definitely be back!"
1528,2015-12-19,5,Fantastic aquarium!!! Highly recommended visiting. The ticket prices are a bit on the pricey side but it's well worth the visit. Be prepared to spend at least a few hours (3+) here so you can get the full experience.
1529,2018-05-04,5,Amazing place... spent 6 hours with a 5year old... we explored every area and was thrilled!
1530,2013-07-03,4,"SUPER FUN PLACE. You get to touch many different kinds of sea animals and its totally safe. It makes you feel like a little kid getting excited for something and getting frustrated when you can't touch a certain animal haha. Tickets are bit pricey but it's pretty worth it. You spend about 3-4 hours of your time there, so its not too bad.Feeding times can be crowded so you have to rush there to get seats or a good spot to watch. The whole entire atmosphere of this place is a friendly eco place. They explain the importance these animals in great detail and try to raise awareness towards these animals. Overall, they leave the place with a satisfied feeling"
1531,2017-05-09,5,We took a trolley there from our hotel. Monterey is a very beautiful place and you can enjoy this awesome scenery inside the Aquarium near the window area. One of the good spot is cafe if you can grab a window seat there :). This is the best aquarium I have been to. Admission is little expensive but it worth it!
1532,2017-05-08,5,Love the kids area and touch pools. The staff were very nice and knowledgeable about issues we asked about.
1533,2018-04-05,5,Came here for the first time with my boyfriend. I'd definitely was worth every penny. I will definitely returning. I recommend going a lite later towards closing so it's less crowded. We will be coming back.
1534,2017-07-23,5,Great place! Never been here before then you really should go because this is the best place to have birthday parties or any kind of social Gathering it's one of the largest aquariums in the world and it's truly amazing to see!!
1535,2017-05-07,5,Beautiful aquarium with so much to see and explore you have to take at least one whole day expect to arrive early for the best time!
1536,2015-12-11,5,"Had a wonderful experience here with our 2 year old.  Our Carmel B&B had free passes available for guests, so our only expense was parking ($7 for the day at the nearby garage).  We spent hours looking at all of the awesome exhibits, watching a 15-minute live-narrated video, trying out all the touch tanks, and eating in the amazing food court that sources their food locally.  Wish we could have stayed the whole day but it was time for our toddler's nap.  We'll be back!"
1537,2017-05-06,5,Great educational and enjoyable Aquarium! The weather in this part of Cali in May leaves Abit to be desired (60s and windy) but that is not controlled by the aquarium (or is it?). Reminds me of the Chicago Shedd Aquarium.
1538,2017-05-29,3,"It is a great place but for couples with kids. It was packed also, due to the holiday (memorial weekend). Parking was difficult, but we got a spot on the road for free, I bet they have parking with free trolleys for transportation, not easily located though."
1539,2018-04-15,4,I'm not a fan of aquariums but have to say this is the best one I've ever to and was the highlight of my12 year old son's San Fran/Monterey trip.  Only giving 4/t5 stars due to cost.  Too bad cost has to be so high on an educational activity that benefits the city and local businesses so much.
1540,2013-10-16,4,"This was a nice aquarium. Some reviews on trip advisor said that we should allot about 3 hours to a full day here. We were done in a little over 2 hours. I was here a  long time ago as a kid, and i honestly don't remember it much, but it was nice to relive it. Sadly, the otter display was closed the day we went so it was a bit of a letdown. I really liked the jellyfish display and the large tank that had all of the sharks and tuna swimming about. I got hungry looking at the tuna. ;)"
1541,2013-12-02,4,"This is a very nice aquarium, unfortunately the price was quite high as it was $35 dollars per adults.  The lady let us get the student discounts however.  There were a number of presentations, I was thinking it would be a boring video me and my girlfriend could fall asleep too, but it was not bad at all like recycle and technology being the green wave which was good.We saw the sea otters which is cool too and cute.  The penguins where nice as well.  You can go outside and take a look at the view.  The nice part was the gift shop was having a black Friday sale so we got a deal off of some stuff animals.  They had a lot of ocean creatures too like the turtles, sharks and big fishes which were nice. The touch exhibit was a little disappointing as there was nothing much to touch, but kelp.  Overall, a good experience and a lot of fun, so if you can suck in the expense for a couple hours of looking then you are good."
1542,2017-03-24,2,I am a local here and left for a couple years for the military. I come back and visit now and then and grew up with this aquarium going in the right direction. I recently visited it and they took a lot of the exhibits that were eye openers. Viva la Baja replaced the seahorse exhibit. Viva la Baja is basically a terrarium. What happened to the otter area in the lower levels. Can't believe they changed that much. Instead of placing food courts and tourist attractions. They should keep it in a more intimate level with the animals. Just don't know about this aquarium anymore. And the price change for locals is ridiculous.
1543,2017-06-25,5,Crazy wonderful. Go really early or late afternoon to avoid the crowded. Get the app with feeding time reminders.
1544,2016-04-30,4,Awesome fun day but I recommend either packing a lunch or going to one of the little shops outside of the aquarium. Lunch was ok but $50 is a little steep.
1545,2016-04-09,5,"My husband and I came from Moreno Valley to visit this aquarium, and we were not disappointed. And when they found out we were on our honeymoon, they gave us cute pins and a backstage tour! We also did the otter tour, and my husband loved it. All in all, a great experience. We wished we lived closer!"
1546,2017-06-23,5,"Our favorite was the underwater feeding in the deep sea exhibit. Definitely watch the schedule to catch the feedings. All the staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. Saw live animals like sand dollars and seahorses that I'd never seen, even at other aquaruims. Seemed spendy, but left feeling good about all the research our tickets will be funding."
1547,2017-04-26,5,"Amazing.  Probably the best aquarium in the country.  It has gotten quite expensive.  We are members, which makes our visits more focused and less of a frenzy.  A family of 4 will cost $180, add $70 and you have a membership.  There are so many things to enjoy here.  The touch pools, open ocean exhibit, the otters, and the kelp forest are must sees.  If you can catch a feeding, you won't be disappointed.  It's a full day with a lot walking, not as bad as Disneyland, but expect to be tired."
1548,2011-01-15,5,"GREAT! Me and my girlfriend visited last week and I am glad we went.  We got there right when it opened and stayed til closing.  They have a variety of sea life and many different exhibits to visit.  This place is very clean and looks very suitable for the animals.  My favorite was the jellyfish exhibit.  With an all blue background and just the jellyfish, it was beautiful.  They also have a seahorse, flamingo, sea otter, and kelp exhibits.  There is just so much to do that if you go, definitely go in the morning.  The feedings are very interesting and they have a schedule for you to follow.  When you first enter, you can sign up to receive text when important things are going on.  We received notice that there were dolphins outside of the aquarium and we knew exactly where to go in order to see them. The staff is so friendly and when we were lost or wondering where a certain exhibit was, they were eager to help out.  I would recommend this place for anyone.  Children, parents, adults, for dates, any occasion is a good one."
1549,2015-12-12,5,"Right on the Pacific Ocean like literary on top of the water. There's total of three floors so it's better to wear a comfortable shoes. Activities like touching certain sea-things, some shows and playground for kids. Also, everywhere was accessible to those whose are disable. I like the part where you can go out and eat in a different location and able to come back in."
1550,2013-08-14,5,"Large, beautiful display tanks. Spacious aquarium with otters, penguins, one octopus and many other interesting beings, from starfish to sea horses, stingrays and baby and adult sharks. Can pet the sting rays, although they were huddled in a corner, obviously not wanting to be bothered by any human contact- rough or otherwise. Informative guides. Eloquent speakers. Visually amazing. Has a quick snack bar, a cafe and restaurant. I was fed someplace else, but, having finished my water, I bought a refillable cup of lemonade.Went on a Sunday; quite crowded but not pervasively suffocating thanks to the spacious interior. Can explore indoors or outdoors, where I popped into the middle of a singing/dancing show informing audiences about the ocean's critters.An aquarium committed to implementing Eco friendly options around the bay, like pushing for biodegradable sample cups (that are used by restaurants and vendors that offer food or beverage samples to passer bys), which are slowly replacing the plastic sample cups which are littered profusely and end up in the bay, potentially destroying habitats and harming the water's creatures. There's a small tank inside the aquarium filled with examples of litter that could potentially be a new home to fish and company, like an old discarded boot, but they still ask, please don't litter!Bigger than Long Beach Aquarium with the same variety of interesting specimens. Cool shops all around nearby, especially in Carmel!"
1551,2015-06-07,5,"Perfect place for the whole family. Large area, indoor and outdoor. Very modern and good service. Dozens of different attractions, hundreds of different fish - from smallest to really big ones. There are several kids playgrounds. Cafe on the site is very nice and not expensive. We've been there two times and totally loved it. Also the Monterey downtown and beach is very nice. Membership is not cheap, but worth it. Highly recommended!"
1552,2016-02-28,5,This is my favorite aquarium by far. It's clean organized and provides a lot of fun for both kids and adults. Their curated collections are always interesting and thoughtful.
1553,2015-08-10,4,"Cool and focused on conservation. Way overcrowded and routinely takes 15-20 minutes just to get in. Not worth $40, especially if you've been to bigger, more elaborate aquariums like Atlanta."
1554,2017-02-09,4,I love the aquarium as much as the next person BUT it's really pricy and very little interactive activities for my toddler. I know it's very stimulating to see all the animals but maybe a little more on hanfs? The employees were super sweet and provided a lot of information. It was a rainy day so finding parking and then walking there was very inconvenient but we made do. I'm not from the area so we make a trip to the aquarium every time we are in town. Hopefully next time she'll be older and she'll be a little more still to enjoy each section a bit more.
1555,2013-02-01,5,"We came this past Tuesday. Weekday, less kids right?  Nope, we came on Home Schooled Kids Day, one of six for the year.   So lots of home schooled kids and parents.  We arrived at 11am.  At the height.  And we stayed four hours.  Hubby had to stop and read every posted sign. And just stare at every exhibit.  I had to sit and wait for him so many times.My favorites - the permanent jellyfish exhibit upstairs and the special seahorse exhibit. Amazing. They've got a special exotic jellyfish exhibit too, but that wasn't as impressive.  The sea otter exhibit is under renovation. But not to worry.  You can see them in the wild right in the bay.  So cute.If you're pressed for time, you can see everything in 2-2 1/2 hours.  But at close to $35 adult, you want to make the most of it.  Fortunately hubby suggested we brown bag lunches so that worked out well.  The crowds dropped off after 2pm.  Keep that in mind if you want to avoid herds of kids."
1556,2018-03-27,5,"I used to live in Pacific Grove and always went at least twice a year. Beautiful aquarium, one of the world's best. Highly recommend the place any day and is a must see if you are visiting the area."
1557,2017-05-14,5,"The aquarium is amazing to walk through but it gets very crowded on weekends & holidays & when kids are out of school. The jellies are my favorite & sometimes I just go & sit there & watch them. And sometime the kids wanna come. However, the food  court is good but kind of pricy. The gift shops are really pricy. But once in a while we'll splurge."
1558,2018-04-07,4,Fun place! Spend a couple of hours or the full day - time well spent! Kids love it. One star less for the so-so food at the restaurant.
1559,2015-02-18,5,"Why, yes, this is the most fabulous place EVER.  The first time I came here, I managed to get sort of an ""insider's look"" behind the scenes because I used to work at a zoo and aquarium and people call people and well, that's what you do.  I've been back probably 5 times since and LOVE IT each time.  Such a magical place but nothing beats sitting there in the jellyfish exhibit and gasping at nature's beauty. I try to come first thing in the morning to beat the crowds (and get decent parking).  You might gasp at the ticket price (nearly $40) but if you stay just 3 hours, that's still a bargain for half a day's entertainment!  And oh, the gift shop - everyone needs a stuffed baby sea lion to bring home."
1560,2013-08-18,5,"Great spot for kids and adults. It's amazing how much sea life, is on site. The building doesn't look like it could hold the quantity and quality of fish, sharks penguins, etc.  But it does and then some."
1561,2016-02-13,5,"Aw man I love this place. Took sis and my little bro for my birthday. This place is huge. The outdoor part was pretty cool as well. Always learn something new.The shop was nice as well. Not too expensive merch. Wanted to buy keychains for us so headed for that tower. Black employee commented to another that keychains were stolen while she was out on lunch right as I was looking at them, she for some reason kept an eye on me. Hello I'm a Teacher!! I teach my kids right from wrong! Other than that place was a real treat. Good Luck finding parking or you can park right there $22 flat for eight hours."
1562,2016-02-13,5,"Growing up in the Monterey County, we always came to the aquarium on field trips or family outings. This is a world renowned attraction. I spent almost 10 years in the Army, and whenever I told them that I was from monterey, they would ask about the aquarium. I can't wait til my son is old enough so I can bring him here to enjoy it as much as my wife and I do. If you're from out of town, this is a must see place. Don't miss out on this!"
1563,2016-03-25,5,It was so amazing so see all these sea life creatures. My son was in aw and so were we. There are a lot of kids activities for them so keep them busy. If you are into seeing the fishes being fed then you have to make sure you get to those locations about 15 minutes before to get good seating otherwise standing is your best bet which is not a big deal really. The place is clean you can see its well kept. Staff is so very friendly they make you feel very welcoming. With all other museums you have to wait a little to see display so that the other patrons can see as well you can't just walk up to it. Overall an awesome experience for the entire family.
1564,2013-04-06,3,"I was slightly disappointed by the Monterey Aquarium, but it's still a great place to go for a first time visitor. There are lots of exhibits with lots of interactive sections for kids and adults. If you're lucky, you'll get a peek at the otters (they're adorable)!What I didn't like:- It's really expensive- It's quite small- Navigating the building is a little annoying and confusing- Do there really need to be THREE gift shops??"
1565,2015-05-07,4,"Freshest sushi in northern California.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is always a blast - not only do they have one of the largest collection of marine life that I've seen, but those responsible for designing the exhibits go to great lengths to make the information interesting and accessible to audiences of all ages.The fish here are fresh, and dead ones seem to get replaced quickly. We did not see the sun fish on this last visit, which was unfortunate - that beast is one of my favorite fish to visit. It is big and ugly, like me, but also saunters about slowly in a majestic manner, like me. Not a care in the world, no sir!They are pretty strict about not eating on the premises except in the cafeteria, and even then, no outside food allowed. On our most recent trip, our whole group of students were asked to leave an outside area because we weren't allowed to eat there. I'm guessing it was because two of the boys kept feeding the seagulls.Come visit if you can. Filled to the brim with educational value. Oh and of course there's the obligatory cute sea otters. Rats of the sea."
1566,2015-12-12,5,"What an awesome place!  My wife an I went here and enjoyed it all.  The kelp forest was pretty cool and it was fun to watch a diver feed all the fish.  She even fed a shark right from her hand!  There was a large variety of sealife throughout the aquarium all of various sizes and forms.  It was so interesting to see the diversity in organisms.My absolute favorite part was the Open Sea exhibit which had thousands of anchovies all swimming in a pack trying to avoid the tuna, dolphinfish, and hammerhead sharks.  I could've sat and watched that exhibit for the entire day if I had the time.  I'll definitely be coming back!"
1567,2015-08-06,3,"Maybe I had really high hopes by reading all these really high reviews, or maybe I'm just more realistic.It costs $40 per adult to get in which is outrageously expensive for what you actually see inside.  That combined with how crowded the place was in EVERY area (we got there at about 10:15AM on Monday and it was so crowded you basically have to wait in line to see each exhibit). With two almost 2 year olds, it was pretty stressful having to make sure they didn't get trampled the whole time  (we left our stroller in the car thinking it'd be easier to navigate the spaces, and it's dark in a lot of the exhibits and the crowd of people weren't very careful where they were going).  It's right in the heart of Cannery Row, so it's a lot of tourists vying for spots near the glass where they can take the best selfie or instagram-able shot instead of enjoying the exhibit.Overall, if you can find a time that's not so busy and get some sort of discount on tickets...then you might enjoy this place.  Otherwise, go on a hike near the ocean and check out some tide pools instead."
1568,2013-10-24,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium was AWESOME! I loved every part of it.  We found parking in a lot closest to the aquarium near Cannery Row and paid $15.  The lots fill up quick, so make sure to get there near opening.  We had bought our tickets online so it saved us from waiting in the long ticket line.  We walked straight in and asked one of the employees what was the best thing to catch...he suggested the feeding of the fishes and he was right, it was amazing and such a sight I'll never forget.  Make sure to get to the feedings early because it does get pretty packed.  Another feeding I was glad to see was the Penguin feeding.  It was really cute to see pengiuns up close in their enclosure swallowing fishes whole.  The jellyfish exhibit was mesmerizing and really educational.  Actually all the exhibits were very educational and great for people of all ages.  Another standout was the octopus.  There were two large octopus in separate tanks.  One of them was in the dark and the other, well, was up in its own corner as well...but we had caught it just as it started making its way down because of its crab sighting.  I guess it decided it was his own feeding time because he grabbed the crab with its tentacle and devoured it!  It was one of the coolest things I have ever seen, I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  There's also areas to touch live sea creatures like starfish and decorative crabs.  Alongside are happy and enthusiastic employees of the aquarium educating you about those sea creatures.  Be sure to step out of the deck to check out the view from the aquarium because it is a beautiful sight.  One downfall was that the sea otter exhibit was closed that day and I LOVE my furry animals....so I was pretty sad about that.  I will definitely have to come back again to visit sometime, it was truly a memorable experience!"
1569,2017-06-27,5,"Yep, this place is great for the family. Take a million pictures. I think its a great place to go at different stages of child development. It's great for the little ones, but elementary age and then also once in Jr High and High School is good too!"
1570,2013-07-01,3,Extremely crowded. The one thing I was looking forward to seeing was the mantis shrimp and they throw him into a tiny tunnel where only kids can crawl through. Probably takes about 2-3 hrs to get around to see everything. For living feeding exhibits I suggest getting there at least 30 minutes early and just camp out or you wont be able to see much. Its even worse when the avg height people start wearing hats in the front that block half your vision. I like the auditorium shows. You get the learn a lot from those. Speaker is pretty funny as well.
1571,2017-06-02,5,"Lovely and relaxing atmosphere. I highly recommend this aquarium to all tourists visiting Monterey, and this is especially true if you have little ones since they have added a section for them to learn and get some hands on experience with aquatic creatures."
1572,2015-10-13,5,"We went on a Saturday and got there early to beat the crowd. It was well worth it! The ticket prices weren't astronomical for what you get, especially if you have kids. The exhibits are amazing, especially the jellyfish and reefs. The sea otter exhibit is great too! Be sure to check out the birds and touch a sting ray. We ended up getting a membership so we can go again. It pays for itself. The kids aren't totally out of control but it's very touristy and there are some rude people."
1573,2016-08-11,3,I was a bit disappointed with this place. I've been here before but remembered seeing so much more. I circled the place twice. I'm comparing to the price and what was offered. It didn't add up. Still it was a fun venture and something to see when in Monterey.
1574,2017-03-16,5,Its been too long and it was worth the time to stop in again. We actually found a couple of great art pieces. They shipped one out for us and it was already delivered. We spent about 700 bucks in the gift shop because of the books and the 3 art pieces that will look great on our walls at home. A little crazy with kids everywhere but what can you do?
1575,2017-02-26,5,Husband took me for my 30th birthday and I hadn't been since elementary school. The staff here are EXCELLENT. They are all incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. Everywhere you turn there's something to see and learn about with demos/feedings going on throughout the day with several different animals. I would suggest going on a weekday though as weekends are incredibly crowded and full of little children (:
1576,2014-01-18,5,This is my first visit here at the Monterey bay aquarium and I was overwhelmed! Parking wasn't so hard to find and was right next to the aquarium. I guess as long as you get there early.All the employees were so kind and helpful. There was always someone within 20 feet of me to answer my trivial questions lol. And they were very knowledgeable about all the marine animals.My favorite portion of the entire aquarium was the Open Sea where they displayed all sorts of beautiful jellyfish. Jellyfish are my favorite besides the octopus lol.I recommend this place to anyone and everyone who loves marine life!
1577,2017-01-22,5,"This is hands down the best aquarium in the world. It always has the best exhibits and a huge variety of sea life. I hadn't visited the aquarium in a few years but they had added some more stuff that I hadn't seen yet like the tidal waves exhibit where you can walk under the waves. My favorite exhibits are still the sea otters, the Kelp forest, and the open ocean exhibit. There's no other aquarium that I've seen that rivals them and is able to give you the sense of what life really is like in the ocean. If you can swing it, it's best to go on a weekday as it's super packed on the weekend. I'd recommend to park a couple of blocks away on Foam St where the meters are $1.50 an hour for up to 12 hours as opposed to the covered parking lots which charge $10 for all day. A good visit at the aquarium will only need 5 hours or so anyway."
1578,2016-01-13,5,"Jelly fish were really cute! Saw the feeding for penguins and otter. The interpreters were very knowledgable, funny and friendly. My boyfriend and I were able to touch the Bat Ray. It was a fun experience! Definitely recommend watching the feedings."
1579,2016-02-13,4,"Spent the day at Monterey Bay Aquarium for the first time. The lines were self explanatory which was good made it nice and smooth. The guy at the ticket booth was nice and accommodating to allow me to buy my ticket as a student even though I forgot my student ID, which was assuring and I was very grateful. Pros:It was very busy day since it was a weekend so I was not able to see the feeding events, so I will not review those. Just as a helpful advice, if there is a certain event you want to go see, go early. The different areas in the aquarium were very educational and enlightening. I enjoyed the large tanks with the various types of fishes and plant life. The lightening to the tanks really draw people in and is inviting. I love the various petting sections they had and the volunteers/employees were very educational and was able to answer questions I had. All in all my experience inside the aquarium was enjoyable.Cons: no parking. Had to circle around in order to find parking. Suggestion: there were a lot of different gift shop areas. I wish they had one gift shop and used the other areas to place more aquariums or other various things."
1580,2017-01-18,5,Great place to take your kids I spent like 3 hours there walking around seeing all sorts of stuff I've never seen before the fish tanks are huge there is one that must have been at least forty feet high there's all sorts of fish and sharks they also have a reptile area with snakes. Good place for your family good place to go for the weekend. The sea otters seem to be like the stars of the aquarium I personally really like the Penguins
1581,2016-03-30,3,It was honestly OK. Not the best aquarium I have been to and it was so busy! We could hardly see the feedings and other things because everyone was crowding the glass In all exhibits which was annoying. They should better monitor people and tell them to politely move after staying at the glass for soooooo long. People should better watch their kids from running around. Beware of parking garages because it was 26$ for an 8 hour flat  rate and we didn't even stay that long! Overall it was nice but we only stayed a few hours because it was too crowded and kind of boring
1582,2017-01-17,5,Such a wonderful place to get lost in for a day and soak up all the sea life and energy!
1583,2011-04-29,4,"4.5 Stars!1/2 star deducted because the main attraction was closed (Outer Bay).  We visited the aquarium on 3/27/2011.  It's supposed to open July 1, 2011.  I heard from one of the associates that the turtles were eating the tiles, so they had to close the exhibit and drain one million gallons of water, then repair the exhibit.  It's been almost a year that it's been closed.  I'll have to make another visit to see the crown jewel of the Monterey Bay Aquarium.Overall, a wonderful aquarium.  My favorite were watching the giant octopus, the sea otters, and the kelp forest.It's definitely worth a visit to see this wonderful aquarium, but I wish I got a chance to see the Outer Bay.  I remember seeing news articles a few years ago about a white shark that was captured and put on exhibit for a short time in the Outer Bay, so it was definitely one area I was looking forward to seeing.Xie Xie!"
1584,2016-11-11,1,"Put this review off for over a year and now that it's veteran's day again I figured I'd post it.I just happen to have been in Monterey exactly a year ago only to hear about the MBA allowing free admission for veteran's and active military. Great I thought! Wonderful day with my significant other, let's add a trip to the aquarium for free!Well the staff up front said I needed to have my VA card; what? Sorry but if you're a veteran you know how difficult it is to get any help from veteran affairs. This coming from a disabled infantry marine/combat veteran. I present my military ID that I always kept with me, but because I'm not active it's no good? Then if I'm not active...but I was in the military...am I not a veteran that qualifies?Anyway, staff was very rude and disrespectful and denied letting me go in.Since then, I've pushed veterans that I run into on a daily to not attend the aquarium because they simply do not care for veterans...just like the VA and all other organizations that want to stuff their pockets.Admission isn't the issue, not looking for a handout since the price isn't bad at all for what they have to offer. It's the principal of the matter; don't falsely advertise that you cater to veterans when you don't."
1585,2016-03-08,4,"Nice way to spend a few hours. I wasn't crazy about a $49.00 ticket price but this place must cost a fortune to maintain. One hot tip, go in the afternoon on a week day, like 2pm, to avoid the school field trips and screaming kids. Getting there early in the day was a mistake but by 2:30 the place had cleared out and there were quiet, sane adults walking around. The aquariums are fantastic and the other attractions are great."
1586,2016-03-26,3,"Good place for kids and adults. Jelly exhibit has good variety. Touch pools cool for the kiddies to touch starfish, barnacles and kelp. There's a clear tunnel where u can see the crash of a wave.  Watched Luna show in auditorium, total ""awe"" fest."
1587,2017-03-24,3,"Never come here paying full price. Fifty dollars for one person is ridiculous. Always over crowded and kids screaming everywhere. It has cool animals and information about the bay, but that's it."
1588,2013-01-22,4,"I wish I could give the aquarium five stars but because of price and obnoxious children I have to take a star off. Que rant: since when do parents just stop discipling their children? When I was growing up I was taught a little thing called manners. I would wait my turn to see giant jellyfishes or understand I am not the only person who wants to see the penguins. And don't even get me started on tantrums. Sadly, I would say 99% of the children in the aquarium were not raised like me. They pushed, screamed and cried. One even smacked by boyfriends knees so they could get to the front of the glass. All while the parents stood their smiling and snapping pictures. I get this is an aquarium geared for children and I love children. I get that they will be excited and pumped. But there is a certain point when parents need to step in. Alright rant over. Besides the annoying children/parents with their huge strollers and lack of manners.... The aquarium is AWESOME!! I kept having to remind myself that what I was seeing is real. The jellyfish in the old room, not the jellyfish experience, are still my favorite section. I do miss the otters though! (They will be back spring 2013) Since I went back when I was ten, they have added the Jellyfish experience and the Secret Lives of Seahorses. Both are nice exhibits but geared towards the youngsters. Watching a seahorse give birth is a strange experience and I can honestly say I have never seen a brown jellyfish until yesterday!!If you decide to head down to the aquarium bring snacks because the snacks here are pricy for what you are getting! 1.75 for a banana, 7 bucks for a turkey and cheese Sammy? Yikes! After paying 30 bucks to get in you would think they would cut you some slack.Overall the aquarium was a lovely, breath taking experience even with the hoards of children. I just wish they had some adults only hours ;)"
1589,2015-09-13,4,"Came here for the first time and I enjoyed it. Spent a few hours here and walked around the area, which I loved. The view is amazing! I love the fish haha they get so hungry that if you trick them by having them think you're feeding them, they'd jump up for the invisible food. I loved seeing the kids being mind blown of the waterfall cave thing. All in all, I had a good experience. We also had extra complimentary tickets for kids, which we gave to some random kids but I hope they had fun as well!!"
1590,2015-05-11,5,The Monterey Aquarium is amazing. The line gets pretty long and tickets are a little expensive but it is worth it. The attractions are great and very educative. A great look into the Californian aquatic life scene!
1591,2015-10-12,3,"EHHhhh,,,i think when i went there i was expecting GREAT things from this place, don't get me wrong i enjoyed looking at all the little sea critters and the beautiful view outside. The things that disappointed me were the big lines in the blazing hot while waiting to get it, and also the price, and the otter area(wayyyy to small and crowded that i didnt get the chance to see them well). Also the little small shops were so over priced, for a tiny simple key chain was like $10.I think its a great place for kids but for me personally i wont be coming here for a long time."
1592,2017-05-17,5,"My wife and I went here on our honeymoon. We absolutely loved it! Maybe because we had just seen Finding Dory, but we thought it was a lot of fun! We spent a few hours walking around and looking at the different exhibits and habitats and we had a great time. There was a lot of staff there and they were very friendly and helpful. Great place for kids, no doubt, but fun for all ages!"
1593,2015-04-28,5,"The World's Best Aquarium, Hands Down! This Aquarium is not only one of the top reasons that puts Monterey on the map as a destination to visit, but prides itself as being a teaching museum. They continually research and build their knowledge of the Monterey Bay and all the life that thrives in our Bay. I have visited Aquariums on the east coast, west coast and Hawaii and this one by far exceeds all of them in educational impact, variety of species on display, use of space and design, and passion for teaching the public the importance of personal accountability in the food chain as well as our impact on the planet with our trash. Their Seafood Watch app and booklets show people the best choices to eat and which ones to avoid so their numbers can come back. We have been proud members for 3 years and continue to be impressed. * Local Tip: Ask for the ""behind the scenes"" tour."
1594,2015-06-29,5,My son and I love coming here the absolute best jelly fish exhibit. Prices are a little high but there is sooooo much to see.
1595,2013-02-28,5,"This place is amazing. There's so much to do. So much to see both indoors and outdoors. They're right on the coast, so you can look at the ocean outside and go inside to learn about what's underneath the water!There are a lot of creature that you can touch. Very family friendly place. Awesome place for kids as there are also many children's areas. A lot of the tanks are breath taking. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!"
1596,2016-06-05,5,Had a fun 3 day weekend here at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. There is plenty to see and very family friendly. You can probably see everything that you want to see in one day. But Monterey house much more to offer.
1597,2016-02-28,5,One of the best aquariums I have ever been to. I love to see the turtles and sharks. However the sea otters are always entertaining. Always plan to spend some time there because there is so much to see. Also go early to avoid long lines and crowds.
1598,2017-05-15,5,The best place in Monterey . The kids love it. I will be back for sureeeee. The tickets are expensive but I still like to go there .
1599,2016-09-22,1,"Overrated & underwhelming... It is really small and not worth the $50 ticket price. If you're interested in truly spectacular aquariums, check out Atlanta's or Sydney, Australia (best in the world IMO). Granted, we have no kids, got there around 5pm, missed the feedings. But still $50 is way to expensive for what you get here. Staff were really nice though."
1600,2014-12-21,4,"JELLY FISH, JELLY FISH!!!!Channeling my inner Spongebob Square Pants because I can stare at the jelly fish all day. Besides the wonderful jelly fishes, I like that this aquarium has such an informative and friendly staff. There is an exhibit where you can get hands-on with some sea creatures. Great place for families, kids and everyone!TIP #1: Make sure to bring your ID if you're a student or senior! There's a discount on admission ;)TIP #2: Eat beforehand or plan to eat after because the food court is quite pricey!"
1601,2018-04-07,4,"We visited on 04/05/2018...we forgot that this was Spring Break for many families.  We always enjoyed The Aquarium...and did this day as well. The exhibits are always great...visual power and educational.  The price has increased since our last visit a few years back..we were surprised, but still wanted to visit.  The views from the outside decks were fantastic and always a sight to behold.  I think we enjoy The Aquarium more when it is less crowded as it was full of children on break who were expressing their awe and joy.  That was a treat....but...after a couple of hours...we needed a break outside. Best to visit on weekdays during the off season.  I can imagine that the summer tourist crowd will be equally full of energy.  The Aquarium on the right day can be almost a place to get into nature and yourself and reach a meditative state."
1602,2017-02-26,1,This is the worst aquarium where I've ever been. Its so overpriced. We paid $100 for 2 adults and we are so disappointed. I would recommend this place only if you have kids
1603,2017-04-11,5,"OMG this was an awesome aquarium!! We paid about $145 for a family of four with a military discount but it was worth the money. Spent about 4 hours inside and my girls loved it. Everything was interactive and is a family must see attraction. By far the best aquarium I've ever been too, super happy I came!!"
1604,2014-09-02,5,Had a blast and look forward to going back! Especially liked the sea otter exhibit and wish they had the funds to expand it to create more space for the otters and create a place for more rescued otters. Yo Yo
1605,2012-12-02,3,"I've been to my fair share of aquariums and the Monterey Bay Aquarium is just not worth the high admission price. Maybe it's just the way I'm wired, but there is only so long that I can stare at fish, seahorses, jellyfish, starfish, crustaceans and other sea-dwellers before I start craving real mammalian interaction. You know, the ability to make eye contact with a living organism and communicate with it in some manner that it responds to, the way you can with seals, otters, sea lions and even sometimes ducks. If I wanted to have zero interaction with the things I was observing, I'd go to a museum or an arboretum. When I go to an institution that showcases living animals, I like to feel like I can connect with the creature on the other side of the glass/cage.With the otters gone until March 2013, there are few marine mammals here. The fish are pretty, but not really anything I haven't seen before. The seahorses are cute and worth a good look. The sharks and turtles are fun--if you haven't seen giant tanks of the same creatures a million times before at other aquariums.The best thing about MBA is definitely the jellyfish. They have an extensive collection and the set-up and lighting of the exhibit showcases these lovely creatures in the best possible way. The colors are dazzling and mesmerizing--rosy pinks, fluorescent purples, fiery sunsets, luminescent glow-in-the-dark greens and more. The three stars are for the fantastic jellyfish exhibits.I wish the aquarium didn't charge an arm and a leg for admission, while offering almost no way for average people to get a discount. However, my grumbling is somewhat tempered by the fact that at least my money is supporting a worthwhile institution that is doing a lot for species conservation. I've been using the aquarium's Endangered Seafood Guide for a while now to avoid buying/eating any species that's even remotely threatened. If you're visiting the aquarium, you should definitely pick up one of the pamphlets for this guide."
1606,2016-07-17,2,"All I have to say is go to sea world. This place is a WASTE of money, also workers walk around the aquarium asking for donations. If this is your first aquarium you might be impressed, but make the drive to San Diego. You won't pay too much more for a YEAR pass and you have bigger exhibits."
1607,2014-11-21,5,"$40 a person is pretty steep. But this is one of the bigger & better aquariums I've been to. Especially if you include the outdoor observation decks outside where you can see wild seals and sea otters!Favorites: jelly fish, octopus, deep sea fish viewing area.Great for kids- lots of interactive activities. Try your best to come on a weekday to avoid the crowds. Tip: If you're planning on visiting other museums like the California Academy of Science... consider buying a SF CityPass for a discount. You just have to use the tickets within 9 days."
1608,2013-04-09,5,"this weekend was my first visit here as an adult  (aka. i could actually walk around at my own pace, read about the animals, and appreciate these beautiful creatures).  You cannot beat the setting that surrounds this aquarium.  Its definitely the most gorgeous location of any aquarium on the west coast.  I highly suggest you walk along the trail on oceanview blvd. to lovers point park.  We biked along this scenic trail, and saw some seals in their natural habitat.  Anyway, back to the aquarium.  They have many cool exhibits here- most of them are free.  Theres shallow touching pools, penguins, sharks, seahorses, jellyfish, deep sea creatures, bizarre looking crustaceans, a kelp forest, cool plant life, birds, and more fish than you could ever hope to see under one roof.  My absolute favorite exhibit was the otters.  They are such playful and social animals.  I could sit there all day and happily watch them interact with each other.  Someday I will have a pet otter.I highly recommend purchasing your ticket ($34) online first.  We skipped the massive line and went straight to the front.  Our bed&breakfast was ~1.5 mile away so we biked to the aquarium.  Not only was it a beautiful 1.5 mile bike ride, we also didn't have to pay for parking :)"
1609,2018-04-05,5,"Take it from a local, it is truly the only 'must see' thing when visiting Monterey. I probably can't add anything new to the reviews. They truly are an amazing organization, dedicated to conservation, and they know that the best way to get people to care about the ocean is to show their own love in every exhibit. You get to see science at work and it is amazing."
1610,2013-08-26,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium has secured itself as ""very special"" place for me and my family.  My son is now 2 1/2 and he is starting to really learn from and interact with the exhibits.  All the aquariums are amazing.  The play areas, touch pools, ""buttons, knobs and levers"" at various exhibits, and outdoor spaces are all great for children.  I love the jellyfish and seahorse exhibit.  And the large thank with the sea turtles, fish and sharks is amazing!Today we went on a Monday right after school started, so we were thankful that there were very few people here. Last time we went on my son's birthday, right after Christmas on a weekend, and it was packed and very difficult to keep track of my then-2 year old.  However, I have to say that this place is so amazingly done that I'd brave the crowds again to come - I'd just make sure to arrive when they open to try to beat some of the more busy times."
1611,2015-02-06,5,"Jellyfish are my favorite, so I'm very happy with the huge amount of jellyfish and other tentacled animals at this aquarium. We've had a membership for two years now, and we visit every few months to spend an hour or two visiting.It's disappointing that there's no official aquarium parking, but there's a parking garage on Foam St. between Hoffman and Prescott. It's usually about $10 for the day to park. There's also street parking, but beware: every single time I've visited, I've seen someone getting  a parking ticket. Monterey is very diligent in checking those meters!"
1612,2015-01-06,4,"It's not the largest Aquarium out there, but it offers a few hours of entertainment. Ticket's aren't cheap, but are not too expensive either. If you have anyone that is a student, have them bring their Student ID to save a bit of money. It goes to a good cause so the money is well spent. All the exhibits are interesting and will keep the kids entertained. The stingray tank, where you can feel them as they swim by is always a hit with the kids. My favorite was the jellyfish exhibit. You can get some nice shots if you've got a decent camera.  As a sushi lover, seeing the huge yellowfin tuna swimming around with sharks was an interesting site. If you are in the area, make a stop here for a nice relaxing day with the family. Afterwards you can drive through the scenic 17-Mile drive, which is real close by!"
1613,2018-04-03,5,"Great place that inspires conservation of the oceans! Always a wonderful, educational time. I love taking family, friends, and visitors here. If you are local, it's totally worth it to get a membership. You will probably visit often!"
1614,2015-01-15,2,"Not worth $35.  I don't know if I've outgrown aquariums (I'm 24) but this was not worth the trip up to Monterey from LA.  First of all there was no parking!  Shouldn't a lot or connected garage be the first thing to be constructed.  Yes there was a garage a few blocks away, but if I'm already paying for entry why should I have to pay for parking.  This isn't Disneyland, it's a non-profit organization.Second, it was sooo crowded and I was underwhelmed by the exhibits.  The overall layout of this aquarium was also confusing and not user friendly.  I felt like I had to back track several times to find exhibits.Yes the outdoor deck overlooking the bay was gorgeous. Probably the highlight of the whole place. Make sure to spend adequate time outside enjoying the view.After the aquarium, we drove through Big Sur where we saw whales, otters, and elephant seals...for free.  Save your money and go for a drive on the coast instead.  You'll see more exciting animals and create longer lasting memories."
1615,2013-01-24,5,"I love the Aquarium! We've been members for over 20 years. If you don't want to be bombarded by children visiting on a field trip, go after 2PM. I think it's open until 5, so that's plenty of time to enjoy it all."
1616,2014-12-01,5,"This is the most beautiful and interesting aquarium I've ever been to. It was fully worth the steep price tag once you see the great work they do to preserve the local waters and the animals within as well as the great amount of educational experiences provided by the staff to visitors and community alike. As a teacher, I was very impressed. Not like some aquariums which are essentially aqua prisons for creatures, Monterey Bay Aquarium has many large tanks (the biggest using water from the bay) with all sorts of sealife as well as outdoor areas which area safe for seals and such. My favorite parts were the jellyfish exhibit and the multi-storey tank with sharks, tortoises, tuna, etc. Just stunning.  I was so glad we were able to visit while in the area. Definitely a special place."
1617,2013-11-24,5,"One of the few places where I don't feel bad for the animals in captivity! The naturalists who work there clearly have a positive affinity for the animals who call the aquarium their home :)The facilities are clean and even when it's crowded, the exhibits are so gargantuan that claustrophobia is a non-issue. Every exhibit is always fascinating and a trip here will surely delight and thrill everyone of all ages!"
1618,2014-11-18,4,"Awesome place to visit. Get there early so you can score street metered parking (some streets offer 12 hour to 4 hour parking). We paid $5/3 hours. Not bad and only two blocks away.We bought our tickets in advance at AAA. $4/off per adult.  Usual cost is $40 and please don't wait in line. There are two floors but we whisked through it pretty quickly spending majority of our time in the ""open sea"" area to watch the feeding.  *NOTE* they only feed the tuna fish on certain days (lame in my opinion). We ate lunch at Cindy's cafe (salad/soup/pizza). Go early to avoid lines.Notables - the jellyfish area and the touch pool."
1619,2016-08-02,3,"Very pricey/not worth the $50 admission if you don't have guest passes/membership/discounts. The jellies, sardines swimming around, and open sea exhibits were really wonderful. Cafe is overpriced, as expected. Thousands of kids running around. Overall, fun but pricey/crowded. I wish there had been more fish. One visit is enough for me."
1620,2015-08-03,5,"Really really awesome facility with cool exhibits and helpful guides.  We got street parking, score, and after learning my lesson at the Perot Museum in Dallas a few months ago, buying tickets online ahead of time and arriving at opening time was TOTALLY the right call and I'd encourage others to do the same.  The Jellies exhibit was a huge hit with our family and I loved the outdoor areas where you could look across the bay as well.  Definitely a must-visit if you're in the area!"
1621,2017-07-29,2,"I have to admit, it's smaller than I expected. A Lyft driver recommended that we visit the aquarium on a weekday. And so we did. However, when my fiancé and I visited this past Monday, it was SO packed. I am not lying when I say it was more crowded than a NYC subway platform during rush hour. The two things that saved our trip to the aquarium were the free guest passes that our Air BnB host left us and the gorgeous sea creatures. When reading the program, it was a little confusing as to where we were supposed to go during the otter feeding. I was a little upset as we weren't able to witness it. Other programs were happening at random places of the aquarium, which made it difficult for those to pass through. Some exhibits were a little tough to enjoy because children were roaming around without their parents. Overall, I did enjoy learning about the ocean and its dwellers. It was definitely an unforgettable experience."
1622,2017-04-26,5,"The only time to go here is during a weekday, about two hours before closing (3PM.)  That's because most of the field trips are ending, and you're free of the weekend crowd.  My girlfriend and I got passes (we find ourselves in Monterey with time to kill between appointments) and honestly can't get enough.  The exhibits are always interesting and honestly I could stand there for hours watching those fish!  The staff is incredibly friendly.  They come in with interesting facts without feeling pushy.  It shows that everyone there loves what they do and want to share these amazing creatures with you.  Whether you're out with your family or on a date, this is a great place to go."
1623,2015-08-01,4,"This really is a very impressive place.  The exhibits are amazing, the staff is great and there are lots of interactive as well as ""stand-and-look"" exhibits.  Even a man outside with binoculars saying they've been spotting whales and where to look... which I'm sure he had said over 100 times but was still just as friendly and helpful.  (We got to see lots of activity... so cool!)The only reason I deduct a star won't affect the majority of people going, but we got a family membership, purchased online and it took a week for them to ""get us in their system"" and actually let our family in without the person whose name the membership was in... my husband.  I know some will say ""it was just a week"" or ""he should have gone with you"" but that's a week of a year membership we were unable to use and he works during the day and when you take 2 tots telling them they are going to the aquarium (because you're members right?)... it's not a good scene when we are ""not in the system""... and have to make other plans.  Paying almost $300 for a membership that's really disappointing and with the amazing displays and 2015 technology available it shouldn't take a week for our family membership to be honored."
1624,2016-10-30,2,"Not worth the price. I agree with all of the low reviews. For $50 I expected more than that. There is lots of artificial displays consisting of a video of animals. Save your money and go to California Academy Of Science in San Francisco, it's nicer."
1625,2015-01-16,5,"one of the best aquariums I've been to because there's so much you can see and do over there. They have a lot of different exhibits that are interactive so it makes for a fun visit.Adult tickets are a little steep though: $35+/person ( I can't remember the exact amout)You can touch some of the sea creatures in several stations that they have set up for you so you can feel them while learning about them! They have a very knowledgeable and friendly staff so feel free to ask questions!I loved the otter and deep sea/kelp exhibit--a definite must see if you are here. The octopus they have is also pretty cool.I love marine biology and geek out when I go to Aquariums so this was a really cool, fun experience. It's like a typical aquarium--don't get me wrong, but I was really psyched to see the otters so it was special for me."
1626,2015-03-28,2,"Ever seen a great fish tank and said to yourself ""Huh, how bout that?"" - Monterey Bay Aquarium is that experience to the extreme. At a certain point, the aquarium remains interesting only to children, marine biologists, and people who are very easily entertained. Now, hear me out; I'm not saying that people who enjoy the aquarium are nerds and simpletons, but I have to believe the average person reaches a point where enough of this place is enough. Do yourself a favor and read the one star reviews.  If you can overlook their occasional causticity, you'll find they reveal useful truths. For example, the entry price is too high, the lines are too long, the strange (at times politically motivated) presentation of the exhibits. But one criticism stands above all others, the sheer amount of people you bump shoulders with in a constant competition to view creatures of limited entertainment value (again, sorry to the scientifically inclined who see things the rest of us don't.). The one star reviews nicely point out the behavior of children. Some even remarked their experience here compelled a decision to never have kids. Judge the seriousness of their quips as you may - I think you'll find the behavior of the adults equally as troublesome. I'll leave you here, permitting the critiques of others to supplement what I've said.  Listen to a Yelp review for once and ask yourself if it's really worth going to a place for no better reason than you haven't been there before. Just because everyone else has done something doesn't mean you have to. Once in a lifetime may be enough trips to the aquarium."
1627,2018-03-28,5,So glad I was able to introduce the aquarium to my children on their first trip to Monterey. We will definitely be back soon!
1628,2013-07-22,5,"Such a fun time to spend a beautiful afternoon walking and observing marine life. My niece had the best time. She kicked, screamed, and cried when we left. Parking was hard to find as there were many people visiting the area. If I'm ever in Monterey again, I will definitely come back to visit the aquarium and Monterey as a whole."
1629,2015-03-08,5,It was a bit stuffy but I think it's a combination of body heat and just the weather. The exhibits are wonderful to include the little kiddie section where they can touch everything! They give you a map when you walk in but of course my little one dropped it. It was good to just wander around. The open sea has a sitting area upstairs if you want to sit and relax. I would definitely come back.
1630,2014-11-22,5,"Amazing place to spend half a day!The aquarium is located at the end of cannery row near the beach. Parking is usually hard to find during the weekend but if you're willing to walk several block. it should be OK. But remember to bring a lot of coins, because a lot of parking meters only take coins, and it's 25c per 10min.We've been premium members of this place since 2 years and it's worth every penny. With the membership we get 2 named and 2 guest passes which we can give to anyone. You also get to enter from the side entrance to skip the lines. The aquarium is very big and by the entrance you're greeted with a very tall tank with the kelp forest. We usually sit in front of it for a while just to enjoy the calming movement of the kelps and the school of sardines inside.There are many smaller tanks around and you should spend some time near each. You'll find everything from tiny shrimps to tilapias. The other tank is a big shel tank with many large fish. On the second floor there are penguins and many tropical fish.On the other side, there's the open ocean exhibit with huge tunas and tiger sharks. Recently they added a sunfish which is quite impressive. There are also a number of tanks with jelly fish.The newest exhibition and my favorite is octopus. The cuttle fish are smart and look directly into your eyes. I highly recommend this place!!!"
1631,2014-11-30,5,"This is the best aquarium in California! And they know it - it's $40 per person and around $36 for students with ID. Parking is $15. The place is pretty big but they give you a map like at Disneyland. The staff were really friendly and knew their stuff about marine biology. They have shows every hour from otters to sharks in a huge movie theater. However, one of my favorite parts is when they feet the otters! They have a live-feeding in the afternoon when they all come out for lunch. The other is the jellyfish exhibit. The aquarium is good for any age!"
1632,2018-03-26,3,"More for kids, not adults. Lots and lots and lots of kids. Clean environment, friendly staff, but the exhibits were not as overwhelming as I thought they'd be. Don't feel the need to go again."
1633,2015-03-17,5,Arrived at the Aquarium around opening and were pleased to see that it wasn't very busy just yet. The friendly staff greeted us as we walked in and made sure we knew where everything was. Very clean and organized with many maps and signs. They give you the opportunity to receive texts for unscheduled feedings which was very helpful. We were able to watch the Open Sea feeding with front row seats on the second floor. I would definitely recommend watching at least one of the feedings. Patrick was a very good guide as he shared with us interesting facts about the animals in the Open Sea Exhibit. Made it through the aquarium in about 2 hours which was good timing for us. All in all it was a good start to a beautiful day in Monterey
1634,2017-03-17,5,I've been there several times and highly recommend this place to everyone! Totally love it as I am a big fan of ocean creatures (jellyfish and seahorses are my favorites- and you may find many different kinds in this aquarium). The place has also very peaceful relaxing atmosphere- when it's not too crowded; so my tip is to go there on weekdays and to avoid bad weather season.
1635,2013-08-07,4,"It's been nearly 20 years since I last visited the aquarium. In that time period I have had children and moved several states away, so I spent some of my visit here was spent waxing nostalgic on how things were before: it wasn't so expensive, wasn't so crowded, we saw more wildlife in the Bay outside of the aquarium, back in the day we didn't need a kids' play area, etc. However, once I stopped comparing it to the past I really enjoyed our trip to the aquarium.The highlight for my kids was the Jellies Experience. They loved seeing the different types of jellyfish and learning about them. They also enjoyed the Rocky Shores exhibit where they could touch some of the sea animals, like the starfish. I remember liking that as a kid, too. I loved the Open Sea tank and staring at the sea turtle swim past me. I've never snorkeled before, but I would imagine the experience would be similar to watching the wildlife swim in this tank... only wetter.Although there are some better and cheaper experiences to check out in the area (I'm personally a fan of visiting the missions), you'd be hard pressed not to find a place that can take the whole day and have something that everyone in the family, from toddlers to adults, would enjoy greatly."
1636,2016-02-09,5,"A most amazing experience. A must visit when visiting the Monterey Peninsula. Not only are the sealife and birds amazing to watch, the educational information on seafood (Seafood Watch) and the films and talks on the amazing discoveries right off the coast at Moss Landing (at MBARI) were the highlights for me.A few tips: 1. Arrive early and try to avoid the weekends as it does get crowded especially in the summertime.2. Go watch the films and talks at the theater -- it is the best part.3. Talk to the people who work there, especially at the touching area. They are such wonderful and knowledgeable people."
1637,2013-10-22,5,"I am in my very late 20s and I was still mesmerised by the everything i saw.The Deep Sea, the Jellies, the touch pond and the Penguins! I loved it.This is a must visit."
1638,2015-06-04,3,This aquarium is huge so huge that it has two buildings! The Monterey Bay aquarium has many educational and interactive exhibits but I wish it had more species available to interact with. Also the shows are only okay the day I went it was otter feedings or an informational session on the albatross bird. I was hoping to be a little more impressed with their selection of marine life.
1639,2015-12-29,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium has been on my bucket list ever since a friend of mine showed me photos from his trip back in elementary school....now in college I finally get to go and I definitely wasn't disappointed.It can be crowded in certain areas, especially during feedings, but to be honest it wasn't much worse than any other aquarium I've been to, and we went on a peak day during school break. You wait your turn and you will still get opportunities to see amazing creatures. The upside to all of the crowds? More money to fund some amazing research and conservation efforts that the aquarium is famous for.I don't have kids, but I can say that my inner child absolutely loved my trip to this aquarium and I'm sure we will be back soon enough."
1640,2017-10-03,3,"Everyone hypes up this aquarium and while the location is perfect for an aquarium with the decks you can view out into the ocean, etc. I honestly thought it would be bigger. Our aquarium in Denver feels bigger than this...my main complaint is it was so crowded you couldn't really view much. We got there right when it opened to try to avoid some of the crowds and went on a weekday but it was still packed to the gills (do I get extra points for the fish pun?) They did have some cool exhibits and maybe Finding Dory gave me unrealistic expectations or all the general hype... but, was kind of under-whemled with the place for the price."
1641,2015-12-28,5,"Love this place! Something for all ages, relaxing and fun and lots to explore! My 2 year old loved it!! Must watch the feeding, so very informative! Lots of hands on things for the little ones."
1642,2015-12-27,5,"THE AQUARIUM WAS LIT. my favorite would have to be the jelly fish and watching the sea otters was so fun, except they wouldn't stay still for a picture. regardless, what a great experience."
1643,2014-09-14,5,"What's not to love?!It's true that gaining entrance to this magical wonderland is pricey, but if you happen to be a student or senior, the annual membership is a steal. At $50, it is only $15 more than regular adult membership ($20 more than student), so its a no brainer if you plan to return."
1644,2015-10-18,5,It's awesome. Pleasing and simple. Crowded; yes. But it's worth it. If the crowds get to be too much then you can step outside and take a gander at the bay. Jellyfish exhibit is the best. This is the 4th time here. Never gets old.
1645,2016-05-09,4,"Went there recently, it was a great experience. Something to remember is that they close at 5 pm, most people were shocked. Must pay attention to hrs of operation. Show up early, you can step outside to cannery row and grab some delicious lunch at over 25 plus restaurants in a three block radius. Overall it's a great! Get away day trip for the family...."
1646,2015-07-29,5,This place is awesome!!!! If you have kids this is the place for hours of entertainment . Just be aware that weekends bring a crowd but it is still very manageable. Even if you don't have kids this is still an awesome place! A lot of different displays with tons of fish. The best part is the aquarium is nicely laid out making it easy to flow through all the exhibits.In Monterrey? Visit here!
1647,2016-04-12,5,"Absolutely wonderful experience! I've always wanted to go here since I was a kid, and I was blown away! The Jellyfish and Open Ocean exhibits were mesmerizing! Great place full of healthy and happy animals!"
1648,2014-08-14,5,"This is a fantastic place and I don't think there's anything I can say that other people haven't, so here are some helpful tips:1. The aquarium gets super crowded and people aren't on their best behavior. I would advise skipping the weekends and summer and come here during the fall when school has started.2. The parking around here can be a nightmare. If you go a couple of blocks up the hill, you can park on Central Avenue for free for 2 hours. Get a stamp on your hand when you leave the aquarium and you can go move the car and get another two hours.3. The outlet mall near the aquarium does have change machines (as advertised on the outside of the mall), BUT NONE OF THEM WORK! Don't get suckered in!4. Don't use the flash on your camera to take pictures. First off, you're not supposed to. There are signs everywhere. Second, you'll get a picture of the glass with your flash in it!5. If you're a AAA member, buy your tickets ahead of time and save some time and money!"
1649,2014-10-29,5,"WOW.Spent about 4 hours here on a Monday morning.  Amazing.Buy tix online before you go...the line was huge on a Monday morning right when they opened.  We didn't but were smart enough to buy tix online on my phone once we saw the line.  Bought em, got the tix on my phone and zipped right in.  Yay smartphones!Faves:  otters, octopus (I stared at him for about an hour, i swear he was so beautiful), the giant tank you can view from all levels - sharks, tuna, turtles, rays,jellyfish.  It was incredible.We enjoyed a craft beer in the cafeteria - that was pretty cool.I have to say that the volunteers there are amazing.  They shared so many neat things and showed us so much cool stuff.  They were clearly happy to be there and share their knowledge.  I would be so happy to come here again."
1650,2016-07-09,1,"not sure why this place gets such great reviews. I would have gotten more pleasure burning a 100 dollar bill. this was by far the most expensive aquarium we've been to, and by far the worst experience. you can tell quickly they spend more money on fancy computers and display cases than actual marine life. they also let about 4x too many people in, so good luck actually seeing anything or not to mention trying to use facilities like restrooms or elevators. we took our son to the Georgia aquarium last year and that was the BEST aquarium we've seen yet. spend your money to catch a flight to Atlanta, apparently a landlocked city can do it better than one leaning over the ocean itself."
1651,2017-03-08,5,Fun for the whole family! Very informative staff and awesome exhibits. This is the place to go while visiting Monterey.
1652,2013-07-20,4,"Prices are kind of steep. $34.95 for adult and $31.95 for students. If I lived closer nearby I would probably get a membership which is $75 for a year for an individual. There are more prices on their website. I loved the jellyfish exhibit and their deep sea exhibit, jelly fish exhibit, sea horse exhibit, and the sea otters. The kelp forest is also beautiful. This is a great place to take kids. There are a lot of interactive fun things in the kid's areas. There is also a touching pool where kids (and adults) touch some organisms.I had high hopes for this aquarium, but it was a semi-let down. I thought it might be bigger or more of a variety of exhibits. It might've been the high hopes, but this is a must stop place if you're in the area."
1653,2015-10-08,5,Best aquarium I've been to by far!! The weather and experience was awesome.. Some of my favorites were watching the otters play and the tentacles section which were full of different types of jellyfish. I'd do it all over again!
1654,2017-01-22,5,"Beautiful, big and lots to do!! Great exhibits and lots of friendly staff on hand to answer questions and explain things. Loved going out on the deck and looking at the ocean!"
1655,2017-04-06,5,LOVED the aquarium!! Had such a wonderful time with the hubby and the Kiddo's. Very clean and everyone is so professional and friendly. Would highly recommend to anyone with kids or even just for a fun inexpensive date.
1656,2012-11-17,5,How can you not love the aquarium?? I've been here a handful of times and spend almost the entire day wandering around.Pros: Penguins and more penguinsCons: Cost of admissionMy only recommendation is to get your tickets early online and get there early. The line to purchase tickets can get super long!!
1657,2015-04-03,5,"This place is amazing.  We went on a Saturday and it was super crowded, so that was a downer but it was worth it.  My husband and I biked there and parked right in front.  There is so much to see that it's best to just get started!By far our favorite spot was where the jelly fish were.  AMAZING.  The exhibits themselves were set up very simply and the jelly fish were the stars.  Such interesting animals.  And of course there is the scope of some of the exhibits - huge!  There is one with sharks and an enormous turtle - people look tiny in front of it, there is the one with all the kelp and a multitude of fish, and even a place where you can pet Rays.  Downright cool.Everything in the aquarium is displayed beautifully and there is plenty to see even if you aren't in to fish.  There are penguins and by far the most popular exhibit is the sea otters.  They are so entertaining but their exhibit is one of the few that, in my opinion, took away from the experience.  If you were downstairs you'd only see glimpses of them diving.  The action was upstairs on their water surface but it was packed all the time and the splatter of water on the windows from their antics made it really hard to see those funny otters.  But that is a tiny negative when the rest of the place is spectacular.  There's even a huge eating area which looked like it was very yummy.  And the store is vast and reasonably priced but has some really neat things.Overall the aquarium was awesome!  We loved everything about it except the crowds but that just says it's that amazing to draw lots of fans.  You cannot go near the Monterey Peninsula without stopping here.  Plan a good 3 hours to see it all!"
1658,2015-08-07,3,"The layout was rather awkward.  Two floors with people pushing and shoving to get close to the glass.  I really thought there would be a lot more to see and do here.  The platforms for the penguin and otter feeding were so small that people were packed in like the sardines that used to be canned here.  I came to see the kelp forest and thought the exhibit would be a lot larger.One of the wings I really enjoyed was the Jellyfish exhibits.  Dim lights, psychadelic sea life, could've done without the attempt at groovy music.  So if you can plug your ears, one can enjoy themselves and not feel like they're walking in on a bad Austin Powers scene.I spent three hours here and for most of the duration, it felt like a glance and go."
1659,2014-08-23,1,"I hate to be the odd man out here and I get all of the warm and fuzziness behind the research and the extremely cute sea otters but wow - this place is a business no matter how you look at it. I agree with a previous review that it is difficult to navigate and seeing all of the mobile-phone cameras flashing; everyone taking forever to take a photo so you are ""in line"" to see the displays - it's just not cool; certainly not a high-dollar museum experience... Buy your tickets in advance, I can't even begin to imagine standing in that line to get in... they could easily develop a system that would allow easier / multiple entry locations; if you are going to charge so much at least make it easy for people to pay. The food is overpriced which is one thing, but I have to wait a while in line for it too? Sorry to be the Grinch here... love the area... this place has become some sort of tourist trap and they are clearly desperate to make the most money that they can with that small location and limited subject scope. They consider it a research institute, non-profit education center.. so let me ask you one simple question:What did you learn while you were there?You might recall some cute little sea life fact but really - I know they are trying to teach us something but somehow the lessons are unclear and fragmented... lost in fancy displays and cell-phone flashes.Also, for the reviewer who said to go during the week if you don't want to be a part of the herding... w r o n g; maybe during summer... but during the school year that place is full of school children. On a positive note the Monterey Bay Aquarium is spotlessly clean and the staff seem happy, I am unsure the sea-life is happy - clearly they are fed well. Thanks for reading."
1660,2014-10-29,5,"Our very first time at the Monterrey Aquarium and I must say , it was worth every penny . The atmosphere is serene and amazing . My shy timid and frightful 5 year old and my  rambunctious 1 year old had a blast here . I was surprised at how hands on everything was. Amongst that , the staff was friendly and outgoing . They must pay their staff well because everyone was jolly. It is very clean there, not a crumb on the floor , spot on the glass or feces in the tanks . It's truly an amazing experience and every photo you take of the beautiful tanks come out picture perfect ! I highly recommend and I can't wait to come back !"
1661,2016-10-08,5,Amazing. Brought our baby and she was in a trance. I was happy to see how engaged she was with everything! Will definitely come back!
1662,2017-04-03,5,Great family friendly Aquarium.Engaging and inspiring. Beautiful exhibits and can take a few hours to complete.
1663,2012-06-29,5,"Enjoyed the Aquarium, better than I remember years ago. There was plenty to see - even considering we skipped anything for kids. We watched two feeding demo's - one for the otters and a diver feeding by hand in one of the ginormous tanks. They were ok - kinda crowded - watched most of it on the monitor - I prefer to stay away from the crowd if possible.The highlights for me - Jellyfish tanks, giant octopus, sea turtles, rays, big tanks, sea dragons, sharks, schools of sardines, penguins, otters - see pics of most of them. Low-lights: The Jellyfish experience - a Hendrix themed area that I thought was kinda lame - walked through that pretty quick. Nice try though. Parking is not great.They do have a lot ecological messages there - which is fine, but I didn't really need it - so I kind of avoided it after picking up a little info. They have a free app called Seafood Watch which can give you up to date info about what seafood is a ""Best Choice, Good Alternative or Avoid"" according to populations - it also give you info about sustainable choices and farming. It lists the common name and Japanese name to use at sushi places, also customizes the recs for your area.Gotta hit an aquarium every 3 - 4 years or so to see and appreciate the diversity of wonderful creatures in the worlds oceans."
1664,2017-04-02,2,"I've been here many years ago and remember enhoying it. I was rexently in monterey and wanted to go. However, at $50/person, I opted out. It would have cost $300 for my family to go. That's insane."
1665,2015-07-20,4,"Aquariums are awesome! You can really see and learn a lot here. The have feeding times through out the day which are cool. We got there later in the evening so only made the kelp forest feeding time which was interesting. A scuba diver came down with a bucket of food. Tailored a bit towards kids but i still learned some new things. And the kelp forest is beautiful. Schools of sardines, big Sheepheads, and there is natural light shining down so it looks amazing.The sea otters... i can watch them ALL day. They were given colored ice with shrimp or squid frozen inside and they bang it on rocks and the glass trying to break it. Super cute! The jelly fish are always my fav at an aquarium. They have a jelly fish exhibit and a groovy ""jelly fish experience.""They also have an area where you can pet the stingrays and another area where you can touch abalone and other creatures. The volunteers there are awesome, super friendly and want to answer all your questions. We had about 2 hours before they closed and we kinda rushed a little bit but pretty much got to see everything. My only gripe is the price! $40 for an adult! Man, that is expensive! We got a discount of $5 off but even at $35 I think it's still too expensive. Make it $25 and I'll be a happy camper."
1666,2016-02-28,5,The best! The Sea Otters were so cute! And I loved seeing the feeding in the kelp forest. So amazing to see a shark grab food from the divers hand. Must see if you go to Monterey!
1667,2012-11-16,5,"By far my favorite aquarium. This place is a lot bigger than other aquariums and makes for a pretty awesome full day. This place has it all - from birds to sea stars to baby rays. When I went, there was also a penguin exhibit that was really unique. And the sea otters are so cute! Seeing them was definitely my favorite part of the trip.Came here during a random time of the year, on a random weekday. While it for sure wasn't as crowded as a more touristy time, there were classes of elementary students at some of the exhibits. Didn't bother us much though since the aquarium is so huge!Can't wait to go back again and see some new exhibits!"
1668,2015-04-25,5,"My 5 year old was so into it, amazed by all the beautiful fish, penguins, turtles , Sharks, octopus, fish, and so much more! Very crowded and touristy, but what do you expect? Parking is around $30 flat rate in the garage, yikes! We got lucky and found a meter one right in front, total paid $3. Woo hoo! Lots to see, great for the little ones because they have a baby proof/mommy rest area upstairs!"
1669,2015-05-07,2,"This aquarium has excellent PR and marketing and I genuinely appreciate the research and oceanography aspect of the place.  They do good work, conservation is important, and we need to seriously look at how we treat the oceans.  As a visitor, though, it was a bit of a disappointment.  I was expecting it to be on par with Osaka or Chattanooga for size, but it only took us an hour and a half to see all the exhibits, and that included watching a feeding at the open ocean exhibit."
1670,2016-09-12,5,The best place in Monterry . Love to come back again.
1671,2015-11-22,5,Awesome place! Took my 18month old daughter here and she had a blast. There is a ton of stuff to do for kids of all ages. I would recommend getting there early as parking tends to get really packed as well as the aquarium itself.
1672,2018-09-25,5,really go place to take kids and get educated they have feedings at certain times and do have places to eat in case you get hungry. my favorite is watching the sea otters being fed and the touch pools getting to touch the sting rays
1673,2017-03-26,5,"Amazing ocean life and fantastic environment for children! This place is a must see if you go to Monterey Bay, they have a breathtaking view of the ocean and then you get to see the ocean life up close which is remarkable"
1674,2017-01-29,5,This was by far the best aquarium I've gone too! It was really interactive and had great information. There was so many different species and the whole thing was great. They offer a student discount which was nice as well. There is a restaurant and coffee shop inside if you get thirsty or hungry. The staff was nice and helpful as well. I highly recommend going if in the area.
1675,2015-08-07,5,"Had an amazing time at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and ALWAYS recommend it to guests staying at the hotel I work at!! I've lived in Chicago and some other amazing cities around the world, but this Aquarium definitely takes the win!my obsession: the Jellyfish!!! you HAVE to check them out :)The food is not too bad either at the cafeteria, if you don't want to go out and come back before another feeding, show, etc. The talks in the auditorium are also entertaining and informative, so if you're around for one of those definitely check them out.If it's a foggy, cold day when you leave the Aquarium (quite common for Monterey) go enjoy a hot chocolate and a cookie across the street at Nestle"
1676,2015-11-17,4,"I come here once a year with the fanily and I never get tired of this place. They do a great job changing the exhibits to keep it fresh...no pun intended. They have a pretty good cafeteria, a little pricey though, which is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.If you've never been here before, it's a must see at least once...just make sure you wait until any pending exhibits are done being constructed beforehand."
1677,2013-05-28,3,"Between this one and the Shedd aquarium in Chicago, I don't know which is best...but, they are close."
1678,2018-03-13,5,My favorite place in the world. And I'm not biased because I live in Monterey. I never go enough and I wish I could. It's a magical place
1679,2016-12-03,5,Love this place! My family has passes so I get to go whenever I come to town through a special entrance. Don't forget to bring your camera it is the most amazing aquarium I have ever been to. I could spend hours there. It's also very kid friendly and has a wonderful restaurant.
1680,2017-02-20,5,"Most amazing aquarium and a research facility as well so you are supporting research and protecting the delicate wildlife of the monterey bay. The monterey bay aquarium is a leader in field research and sustainable ocean practices. They take in injured wildlife and heal them with the intent to release back to the wildlife. I love that the animals always come first, not the tourists. It's an amazing place to visit and awesome. The exhibits are world class and there is plenty so do for all ages including young toddlers. I bring mine here all the time! We support the aquarium every year through membership and sponsorship! Thank you for the hard work of all the aquarium leaders, employees and volunteers! We love you!!!"
1681,2017-01-06,5,I always enjoy going to the aquarium. I have been going here since I was in grade school taking field trips.
1682,2013-04-12,5,"One of THE BEST (and my favorite!) acquarium!!!!Monterey Bay itself is already a beautiful place to visit, but I must say, the aquarium is one of reason why I love visiting Monterey Bay! Oh...and yes, I love aquariums!Tons of exhibits, visual sensory overload, lots of different and interesting and beautiful creatures.This is a wonderful and educational place to visit for family and kids.All sorts of exhibits that showcases:*Giant octopus*Jellyfishes*Kelp forest*Sea otters*Seahorses*Penguins*Habitats*Open sea creatures*Birds*Humpback whales*DolphinsThey have all sort of daily shows, activitites, tours and adventures that you can check out.  There is a cafe you can dine to relax and enjoy the view.You can event book the place (well, not the entire aquarium!) for bday parties, anniversaries, special events.  :)I can't wait to come back to visit again when I'm in the north CA!!  I miss this place!"
1683,2015-12-21,5,"The ""Tentacles"" exhibit was out of this world--the constant color changes of the Flamboyant Cuttlefish are fascinating, and a huge red octopus gave us quite a show. Never disappoints."
1684,2016-06-18,1,"Overall it is a decent place to visit, however, the preaching they do about the environment is a sham. My son watched as they came and grabbed numerous food items from the heat lights and threw them all in the garbage, this was at 3:10. Even my ten year old knows better and asked if the aquarium staff new that food waste was bad for the environment. Don't give paper straws out (because you love the environment) and then throw untouched food in the garbage!"
1685,2013-05-19,4,"Great aquarium!  It's pricey, but it is better than the Long Beach aquarium mainly bc of the 1 million gallon tank they have with the hammerhead shark, giant tortoise, and various other humongous sealife. yelp.com/biz_photos/mont… Also there was a huge school of fish down at the bottom. yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Also the staff there are very informative and helpful.  Jellyfish exhibit is huge, and I LOVE jellyfish! yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Other notables:Cool skeletons on display.  How long did it take to put these together I wonder? yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…How our piers look underwater.  I always wondered. yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…This fat guy. yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…This cutey baby tortoise. yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…This cutey too. yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Epic moray eel vs. cleaner shrimp battle.  Wonder what they were arguing about? yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Seahorse trying to strangle a mini Stay Puft marshmallow man? yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…The decor around the ""Reef"" exhibits were pretty cool. yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…yelp.com/biz_photos/mont…Along with two giant octopus (octopi?; no pics, they don't like to be photographed), sea urchins (uni), spot prawns (amaebi), cuttlefish, spiny lobsters and lots of other creatures I wanted to eat, plus an avary with rescue birds, and there's plenty of touch pools (don't have to fight off the little kids for space, well not much anyway) with knowledgeable staff to explain things to you.The downsides (besides the prices): If you are late to a showing at the auditorium you are assed out.  They won't let you in.  We missed the jellyfish one, and there's only one showing a day.Gift shop prices.  I know museum gift shops are always overpriced, but some of the stuff I was like WTF REALLY?!  Plus there are three separate gift shops.  Do they really need three?Viewing area around the sea otters.  This is a very popular exhibit, and when it's feeding time, it's really hard to get a good view unless you camp out there at least half an hour prior to the feeding time.I felt a lot of the tanks could have been lit up a tiny bit more so that those with subpar cameras (me) could take better pics."
1686,2016-11-29,5,"This place is fantastic. I managed to get a student discount. So I spent my Thanksgiving Saturday here for around 5 hours. There were lots of people and LOTS of kids. The ticket lines moved fast. The woman who served us was very polite. Although the floor layout looks small, there are many things to see that can easily eat up 5 hours. My favorite exhibit of them all are the jellyfish. I also love the bridge that takes you across the jelly fish exhibits to the splash zone. You can see an amazing view below! I wasn't able to see their shows. But overall, I'm satisfied! I would definitely drive back to Monterey to visit again!"
1687,2015-11-06,5,Took family here!  So much fun. Very clean.  Wish there was more time to see and do everything... All staff was so helpful and friendly.  Can't wait to come back!
1688,2018-01-02,5,"By far the best Aquarium on Cannery row in Monterey. My favorite area is the deep ocean exhibit. Watching all the mahi mahi and tuna swimming around makes me want to head to the closest sushi restaurant or at least charter a deep sea fishing trip. This is great for the kids too. They have a great kid area if they need to burn off some steam and plenty of outdoor space for viewing. The sea life is amazing both inside and out of the aquarium. I highly recommend scheduling your trips around the feeding times if you want to see lots of fish activity, or not (if you want to stay away from the crowds). The penguin feedings are also a blast too! My family and I joined as members and highly recommend doing the same if you're in the area for long term. What is nice is that the membership also provides two guest passes if you have friends or family visiting. Go see the aquarium and spend some time there!  Between that and the membership you can pretty much visit whenever you're bored and looking for something to do. Remember if you're a resident to get the parking sticker."
1689,2015-01-30,5,"Wonderful place to visit.  Jelly fish, octopi and the kelp forest are my favorites, but there really isn't anything here that is poorly done.  Lots of stuff throughout for all ages too; little playground areas interspersed for the very young and some good interactive and education electronic things.  The animals are the highlight, but they do a great job of highlighting so many aspects of the ocean.  The two restaurants inside are good too; one is a high end sit down place and the other more cafeteria style so they cater to a range of budgets."
1690,2018-02-14,5,You can NEVER go wrong going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium!  Our most FAVORITE place in the world!  We've been a member for over 27 years and counting.
1691,2012-07-12,4,"When we were planning our trip to Monterey, visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium was at the top of our list. It's located right next to Cannery Row and is a short walk from many of the hotels in the area. Admission prices for adults are $35, but with my student ID card, it was $31 - still pretty pricey even with a discount!They had tons of exhibits like the Sea Otters, The Jellies Experience, The Secret Life of Seahorses, The Open Sea, penguins, coral reefs and kelp, and even a little theater where we saw a presentation on Great White sharks. Our favorites were definitely the Jellies Experience, the Open Sea, the Seahorses, and the presentation on sharks.Though not a holiday weekend, it was still pretty busy at the aquarium. I was expecting this but at some points it was really hard to get around without strollers and kids bumping into you. With time and patience, you can get through all the exhibits.My ONLY complaint was that they didn't sell water bottles. We went to the cafe and the gift shop and no water bottles could be found. Everything from soda, juice, and iced teas were offered but no water. I thought that was pretty weird and not sure why it's not sold here considering it is an AQUARIUM and all ;)Overall, I'm really happy that we finally got to visit the aquarium and loved it. If you are planning a trip to Monterey, visiting the aquarium really is a must!"
1692,2016-11-26,3,"I would give the Aquarium 4 stars if it was more affordable.  I'm one of the lucky ones who often get free passes and, if need be, can afford to pay for the ticket price.  However, I can see how some families are unable to afford such a steep price of admission."
1693,2017-03-16,5,We bought a season pass because we have a newborn. The nice thing we get guest passes to always parents and friends to come and share the experience with us and our baby. Beautiful place with lots to see!
1694,2014-07-20,1,"Man. Aquariums are some boring shit. I'm amazed I let my friends talk me into going to an aquarium because they are just as boring as I expected it to be.First off, this aquarium is tiny. And the fish they have are mostly all on the small, uninteresting, and easily forgettable side. Most of them look like they belong on my dinner table plate more than they do in a display because they are just basic as all hell.Second, for the displays that show any remote potential for cool (jellyfish and open sea), it's repeats of the exact same fish. I know fish all look the same but even I can tell when you're throwing the same fish in my face for the 15th time. Also get some more fucking turtles or shit for your deep sea exhibit. Your sun fish is just ugly and I don't care about flocks of fat ass tuna.Third, the place (as expected) is infested with screaming children with parents who either can't or won't keep them in line. And I knew all these things beforehand. I knew this is what the stupid aquarium would be like but I let myself be talked into it anyway.So really I'm the idiot here."
1695,2014-07-21,3,"I was really disappointed by this aquarium... 4.5 stars with 2000+ reviews? And this is NorCal, so I expected the aquarium to be amazing... so much so that my friends and I took a trip down to Monterey JUST to check it out. Also, tickets were pretty expensive ($4 discount when purchased online).It felt more like a jellyfish exhibit than an aquarium... not much diversity, and it was definitely geared towards families (with young children). Didn't learn much, and the hands-on exhibits were also pretty boring. Perhaps the only memorable part of my experience was watching sea otters get fed... have never seen one up close before. What I learned was that they look like giant rodents, ha."
1696,2016-03-13,5,"There is not enough space to illicit how magical and wonderful this experience was. I went here some years ago and am yearing to go back because every detail is etched in my mind.The experience overall is a spiritual one, having felt like you can walk on the bottom of the ocean among its inhabitants while the ethereal music places in the 'open ocean' exhibit is gorgeous and very meditative. Monterey is my hometown as well, so this struck a cord with me. The seakelp forest exhibit and many many others are so inspiring to see the worls beneath the surface as are the sections where you actually get to touch stingrays and other fish in the open exhibits.The aquarium has so much to offer, underwater creatures hang from the ceiling in suspended animation and there are opportunitiea to go outside and stare into the bay. The otter exhibit was too cute and you can really tell everyone who works there loves their job. I will be back!"
1697,2018-03-07,4,"It's a great place to visit. Seems to me, though, the exhibit is not as good as before. The mornings and weekends are usually crowded. A good place for people watch."
1698,2015-02-17,5,"This is a great Aquarium. I visited the aquarium in January with my boyfriend. It definitely provides entertainment for people of all ages and is very kid friendly.After watching ""Luna: A Sea Otter's Story"", we were inspired to take their behind the scenes sea otter tour. We learned about their foster mother program and all the work they put into helping stranded baby sea otters. The tour was great. The tour guide was very funny and interacted a lot with the crowd. Additionally, they provide you with little radios and headphones so that you can hear every word the guide says! On the tour, you are taken into the ""employees only"" sections of the aquarium, where you get to see the vets office, otter tanks and monitoring systems. There's a lot of stair climbing, so definitely ask about handicap accessibility. They were having a two for one special on the tours, so we only paid $15 for both tickets! Their viewing deck is amazing, they have some of those quarter operated binoculars, but I'd definitely recommend you bring your own if you enjoy animal watching. You are guaranteed to see wild sea otters swimming around the aquarium's edge. We even got to see a Momma sea otter floating around with her baby resting on her tummy, it was adorable! The jelly fish exhibit is big and has a lot to offer. Definitely talk to the employees around the aquarium; they are very knowledgable and provide great insight on the aquarium."
1699,2012-09-30,2,"The bad review is only for the crowds, not the quality of the aquarium. It definitely had a great variety of species and we also went to an awesome talk on Great White Sharks. However, it was so uncomfortably crowded that we had to go outside a few times to escape the hoards of tourists and crying babies. I understand it's a family-centric place, but now that I know there's hardly room to navigate between strollers let alone get anywhere near the front of a tank , I definitely won't be back any time soon."
1700,2012-05-18,5,"Prices are up @ $33 but it's still the BEST AQUARIUM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. Definitely worth a day/weekend trip from SF even though it gets pretty crowded. They still have the pool where you can pet the sting rays, sea cucumbers, starfish and anemones, too bad there isn't a sushi station where you could eat them too. Just kidding! (not really)As much as I miss the super huge Tunas which were my favorite from when I visited as a kid. The JELLIES experience is my favorite now.Captivating - (yelp.com/biz_photos/2DX5…)and interesting (yelp.com/biz_photos/2DX5…)Long tentacles - (yelp.com/biz_photos/2DX5…)I thought about getting a jelly tank for home from jellyfishart.com - (yelp.com/biz_photos/2DX5…)Someone mentioned they should have a happy hour night like Nightlife @ Academy of Science where music, creatures, and cocktails come together. That would be cool for the MBA."
1701,2014-11-05,5,"I think the first time I came to the aquarium, it was for a field trip as a little kid. What totally made my day was all the hands-on exhibits: being able to touch some of the starfish, sea urchins, and skates was just the coolest thing EVAR. The special exhibits get changed, and the last one I saw was the seahorse one (which was amazing, they are such graceful and neat creatures). I've heard that the current jellyfish one is also neat, and it makes sense, there's a lot of talented people working there who care about the animals and making the science accessible to all ages. Places like this exist and it's wonderful that they do, because it gives the public access to see things that would otherwise likely be impossible on its own. Bottom line: an amazing local aquarium, which should be visited and supported to experience the awe-inspiring lifeforms that exist on our planet."
1702,2015-09-12,4,The aquarium was fantastic! We were able to get members visitor passes so we could enter in the members entrance which made it a lot easier- especially because it was Labor Day weekend. We enjoyed the shows and the touch tank. I was very packed though due to the holiday weekend- don't suggest visiting on holidays
1703,2018-02-05,5,The most amazing aquarium experience. Huge complex and expert staff. Even the cafe food is good. This is truly a teaching aquarium who cares about educating people about marine life and not just for profit. Don't miss it if you are in the area.
1704,2014-07-07,3,"So, I know I am in the minority with this review, but I wasn't exactly blown away by this aquarium. Yes, it's on a beautiful spot in a beautiful place. Yes, it's massive and interesting. However, for the staggeringly high price tag I guess I expected just that: to be blown away. The highlight for me is the auditorium-style room with the gigantic fish tank. I loved sitting in there and watching a mix of both recognizable and exotic fish and turtles swim in harmony. The tanks of sardines throughout the space were cool, too as was the viewing deck where you overlook the bay and can spot otters in their natural habitat if you look closely. There were just a bunch of things about this aquarium that were ordinary and even a little disappointing. I know we're supporting the lives and health of the animals that live here, but I would hope for something a little bit more remarkable from one of the most famous aquariums in the world, I guess... Especially for that price!"
1705,2014-06-09,4,"i'd visited monterey several times before this most recent trip, but this was my very first time visiting the famed aquarium on cannery row.  it overlooks the monterey bay so you will have a terrific view while visiting, especially if you are on the 2nd floor.from all the things i'd heard, i guess i'd expected this place to be the largest aquarium in the world, with multiple levels and numerous displays, so many that i wouldn't be able to see everything in a single visit.  but i was slightly disappointed upon arrival, when i saw that there were only two floors, neither of which was actually that big.this aquarium is definitely catered towards children, as the wording of the signage, height of the displays, and nature of several exhibits (touch pond) draw the interest of those under 12, moreso than teenagers and adults.  rather than reading the short phrases and touching the creatures in the designated areas, i spent my time looking at the sea creatures and trying to get through the entire place since i had just the 1 afternoon there.my favourite part of the visit were the animal feedings, which are done every few hours.  on this day, they allowed guests to view feedings for the following: penguins, otters, puffins, and kelp.  i really enjoyed watching the animal specialists feed and care for these sea animals and creatures and learning about what each group eats.  for the penguin feeding, we were asked to all sit on the ground so that everyone had an equally clear view of the feeding.  i only wish this method was carried over to the other feedings as that would have made the viewing much easier for me, since i'm pretty short.general admission is $40 for adults, $35 for students (13-17 and those with college ID) and seniors (65+), $25 for children (3-12), and free for children under 3.  these prices are on the high side, but you are paying for the location, the specialists, and the unique exhibits that can only be found here.  the ticketing line will be quite long on a weekend, but if you are a member, or have day passes, you can use the members only line, which moves as quick as a flash.  you can also purchase your tickets online to save time.lots of options for parking, either park on the street and feed the meters or park in one of several parking structures for a flat fee (anywhere from $10-20 for the entire day)."
1706,2017-03-07,2,"Too much going on, not enough to keep the kids busy! Staff or shall I say volunteers were rude! And the cafe was a complete chaotic mess that I literally waited 45min for a damn HOTDOG!!"
1707,2015-01-21,4,"I been a fish person all my life. I always enjoy going to fish store and check out their fish. When I came here with my girlfriend. Omg. This place just takes me back to my childhood memory when my parent take me to fish store. lol. There were so many different type of fish. The fee for this place is not too expensive. But it is also not too cheap where you can visit every month. There tons of fish tanks for people to check out. We came here on a Tuesday and it was pretty dead. We were able to find parking on the street. You can get a stamp to go back in so we just pay at the meter and go out to pay more at the meter and then return to our adventure inside. There are so many different fish tank that I can be here all day long. So many fish in many tank. I'm surprise how some fish don't eat each other lol. Also. Don't forget to stop by to watch some video that they provide. I learnt a lot from it   Overall, this place is a great place to check out if you are interested in fish. Even if you are not into fish, still come check this place out as it is for a good cause as this aquarium used the entry fee for many different project."
1708,2014-12-28,4,"What is there to say about the Monterey Bay Aquarium that's hasn't already been said? I went specifically to see the Tentacles Exhibit since I have done neuroscience research on octopuses and know they are some of the most intelligent animals on the planet. No matter when you go, the Monterey Bay Aquarium will be packed with people. Any time, any season. Plant to spend a good chunk of time here as there is so much to see. Adult tickets are $39.95, kind of steep, but if you use your student I.D. you can at least save $5. The Open Sea and Kelp Forest exhibits are some of the best: having a hammerhead shark, green sea turtle, or Pacific bluefin tuna swim right by your head as you peer into the massive tank is mezmorizing. The Tentacles Exhibit was amazing, but packed with people. If you didn't love cuttlefish before, you definitely will after visiting. No trip to Monterey is complete without a visit to the aquarium."
1709,2010-07-13,5,"Where do I begin ...It can be quite the journey to get here, but once you do you'll be amazed.  We had tickets for two days, but were unable to come back again the following day ... so spend all day there.  From watching the otters bring fed, to seeing all the animals from and underwater view, from seeing all the penguins inside & out ... this place has it ALL!  I NEVER ran out of things to look at, I could've stayed at each area for hours on end ... my boyfriend had to keep prying me away so that we could actually have time to see everything else.We were fortunate enough to catch the seahorse exhibit, which seriously made my day.  Everything about this place is absolutely amazing and just keeps getting better.My only regret is not coming earlier to be able to catch all the feedings, if I ever have some time to make another trip back ... that'll be the thing to do -- well that and a possible behind the scenes tour.- !! LOVED IT !! -"
1710,2014-12-19,5,"This place is as close as you can get to many so nice sea organisms. They can swimming around, dancing, and teasing you if you like seafood. It's a fun experience here."
1711,2017-03-01,5,ALYSSA at will call is Awesome! She was super friendly and made our experience there one we will not forget. My boyfriend and I were there for the day and Alyssa made our day.
1712,2015-08-24,5,"I was visiting the area doing the tourist thing. Iv heard great things about the Monterey Aquarium. I am use to attending the Aquarium of the Pacific (in Long Beach) so I was eager to see how this one stacked up. The rates for admission are acceptable ($39.95 for general admission). Once inside there are multiple gift shops and tons to see! There is everything from Sea Otters, to scuba diving and jellies (my personal favorite). When taking pictures make sure to turn your flash off.I would have to say my favorite experience was the gigantic tank that had the school of fish, Sharks and turtles. Throughout the entire exhibits they play the most peaceful music. I could stay there all day!"
1713,2017-08-20,1,So packed and not as spectacular as people had insisted it was. Nothing special about it. All the tanks seemed very small and the animals seemed cramped and sad. :( very disappointed and was saddened the whole visit. There also was no information about educating the public about how to help the ocean recover from overfishing and pollution. Considering the scientific data is pointing to fish less oceans as soon as 2048 this is a very important topic to cover.
1714,2017-03-20,5,"What a beautiful place! Wonderful, helpful staff who all seem to have a genuine love for the animals there. The place is focused on conservation above all, which is a fantastic lesson for all those who come through the aquarium. Creatures that you never even knew existed are here, ones that are absolutely fascinating. This place is an (obvious) must see for a trip to Monterey."
1715,2016-10-22,5,Went here for the first time on our honeymoon. Very happy with my first visit. Very impressed with all the animals and displays. They do a great job of mixing up the displays. Would recommend a visit for everyone who has never been or has not been in a while.
1716,2014-12-30,4,"Nunca creí que este acuario estuviera tan bonito, me encanto y quede fascinada , para los niños es estupendo, lo recorrimos en dos horas,( mirando rapidisimo todo) estaba exageradisimamente lleno, pero aún así lo disfrutamos."
1717,2014-11-27,5,"It's the friggin' Monterey Bay Aquarium people! WooHoo!This was not my first time there, but I never thought to write a review before, so here goes:First off, we went on Thanksgiving day, didn't even think they would be open, but there they were! We very wrongly assumed it would be kind of slow, and that most people would be home having dinner. No. It was the busiest I have ever seen it!People are so rude and inconsiderate, with absolutely ZERO situational awareness! I have to admit there were times I was unable to keep my mumbled curses to myself. But none of that is the fault of the aquarium, so I can't hold it against them.Despite dodging strollers and trying in vain to avoid screaming kids, we were of course in awe of the displays and learned a lot. And we got to enjoy a delicious and environmentally conscious Thanksgiving dinner while there!You HAVE to go! But if you have the option, try to go on a weekday. Unless you have kids, then by all means, go on the weekends and holidays so the rest of us can enjoy it in peace on the weekdays."
1718,2012-09-19,5,"I love this aquarium so much!! I had so many amazing moments and I definitely hope to come back here some day.Tips:-Buy the tickets online! When I got there at 10am which is when they open, the line was already super long. With printed ticket on my hand, I just went straight for the entrance.-Go there at least before 11:00am. The open sea feeding is usually around that time. It only happens once a day and you don't want to miss it. When hundred thousand of sardines swim for the food, it is a spectacular scene. -Food is quite expensive inside (about $10 for a sandwich). I would suggest bring food in or come back outside for Subway for budget travelers.  -Parking at the garage is $10. If you are willing to walk, you can park near the residential area just a few blocks up to save the money."
1719,2015-04-24,5,"It's been awhile since I've been here and the other day our 2nd grade class had a field trip here.  We arrived early and we were able to check in early to get our students more time inside the aquarium.  The staff are all so friendly and helpful and this made our trip even more amazing.The aquarium is pretty big and there is so much to see.  They have a Jellies experience (Jelly fish) area that's pretty amazing.  They even grow their own jellies, how cool is that!  You see different types of jellyfishes and the different colors, from a blue, brown to one that glows. We saw different types of fish, turtles, sharks and sea creatures.  There was a hand on exhibit where you can touch a star fish and kelp which the kids absolutely love.  It was a great experience for the kids and by the end of the day, they were worn out because of all the fun that had.  It's such a great place to bring your kids and I would recommend staying and walking around the area, they have some great restaurants."
1720,2013-07-12,5,Definitely a must go if youre in the area---Monterey is beautiful and Touristy with lots to do BUT Ive only really gone for the beaches AND this Amazing Aquarium. A non profit aquarium dedicated to educating everyone about the importance of our marine life. Great exhibits and huge viewing areas to see LOTS of fishes and fun feeding times of the animals. Sign up for text alerts so that you can make it to the feeding areas in time to see them while youre there---the numbers are deleted afterwards.Pricey BUT you get a LOT for your $$.Nice and Helpful staff.
1721,2018-03-10,5,"An absolutely fantastic experience for the entire family.  This is where kids can have a great time learning--as can the adults.  The only problem is, try to get the kids to leave."
1722,2016-12-06,5,"I've been to a few aquariums and this one was the most educational by far! I enjoyed the shark videos, and the sushi guide!"
1723,2018-01-19,3,"The Monterey Aquarium is clean and is definitely nice but it's so expensive. We went through the entire aquarium in 2 hours. Granted, we didn't do any of the ""ted talks"" sort of thing in the auditorium because we have a toddler but I've been to other aquariums that had bigger sea life. I enjoyed it while I was there but would never spend $50 to go there again."
1724,2012-12-12,5,"Great for adults. Great for kids. Great for groups. Overall, great.I took my boys here with he help of my sister-in-law. I honestly can't really review this place because there is too much to cover. I'll try my best.We parked a few streets away so we didn't have to pay $20 to park. Very short walk. Worth it.I received a student discount with my UNIV ID which got me in for $31.95. My 5 year old was about $12 (?) and my 2 year old was free.The aquarium is evenly spaced out and roomy enough so that if it is busy there is room for all of the people to walk around. The 1 st tank that they have there is AMAZING! they have hammerhead sharks and green sea turtles along with yellow fin tuna.My oldest son was able to touch so many sea creatures, I'm so happy that they have those exhibits for the public. There were a lot of things to touch. Can't remember them though!They have a 2nd floor deck where you can leave the aquarium and look out at the ocean. That was nice. It was so beautiful and a lot of people were picnicking out there.There are a couple of kid areas where they can play which was nice because toddlers need a break every now and then.We were there for over 2 and a half hours. Totally worth it."
1725,2015-07-04,3,"Beautiful aquariums,  it was really hard to get close to anything with it being so crowded.  I thought there was going to be more to do. Extremely over priced! Not that many things to see for that cost. Came on 4th of July,  I'm military it would have been nice to get in free on this special day!"
1726,2015-09-11,3,"This is just a totally average aquarium, I'm actually surprised by the five star reviews! I've been to wayyy better aquariums like the National Aquarium in Baltimore and the Miami Seaquarium (plus others) which make the Monterey aquarium seem boring. I have just always expected to see a dolphin show when I visit an aquarium! Or at least a really special interactive exhibit. They do have the sea otter exhibit but it just wasn't that interesting!Here is my honest take: if you have young children or have never been to an aquarium you will probably enjoy it. However, if you've been to a an aquarium before (especially on the east coast) I would save my money since I can guarantee this aquarium will seem generic."
1727,2014-09-27,4,"I try to come here at least twice a year, and I am very successful at doing that.  Why only twice a year, well the price of admission.  Yes, i know you can get a membership, but that is good if you come here twice, and since we live here in Northern California we have so many other things to do outdoor or indoors for that matter.About the Monterey bay Aquarium, this place starts you off with friends people greeting you at the door, welcoming  you to their home and the sea critters home too, the place is well maintained and you can always find somebody from the staff cleaning.  the volunteer staff needs to be out more helping other within the facility instead of just hanging out at the entrance of the aquarium, but still they are very knowledgeable about the facility and some of the exhibits.I do enjoy walking all over the place, including my boys, they love taking pictures of the sea life but most of all they enjoy the tide pool, where you can hang out under the waves and see what happens when the waves hit.  It is very educational and a great place to learn out out bay, ocean and world.Looking forward to my return and next visit."
1728,2014-09-21,5,"Shark!  I was making a semi-sarcastic, semi-sappy comment about the oohing and ahhing kiddies at the Open Sea exhibit when the hammerhead shark swam speedily past us and I stumbled mid-step after I yelped(yes, I yelped in glee.) Then I was talking as fast my mile-a-minute little chatterbox, ""oh my God, did you see that, it was so beautiful, oh my God, where is it, where is my camera.""  Yes, I got a few laughs. And I don't care. I saw a hammerhead shark. Many times. We were in town so I could run a race and were not going to pass up an opportunity to visit this landmark. Yes, it's pricey and crowded but my daughter had NEVER visited and it had been years since my boyfriend or I had gone. Two hours is barely enough time to see the exhibits so I would recommend getting stamped to step out for meals so you can spend lots of time there. We got discount tickets through my credit union and through my boyfriend's military discount so do your research and save. The 8 hour street parking is much cheaper than the $30 dollar for two hours private lots surrounding Cannery Row. Ask a friendly staff member to snap your pic out front. And do charge your camera battery. Both my camera and my cell phone died mid-visit. Mommy fail!"
1729,2014-08-27,3,"WAY TOO CROWDED. While I was excited to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium before our trip because I had heard it was one of the must-see attractions in Monterey,  that excitement turned to disappointment at the fact that you could barely see any of the exhibits while feedings were taking place or just see any of the exhibits in general due to the huge crowds. The aquarium didn't have any dolphins, which I found surprising. While the aquarium had a touch tank and a little playground area, the aquarium was much more suited to being a children's museum with some sea-life thrown in. Having been to Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut (which has a wonderful beluga whale exhibit and dolphins and seals and sea lions) and the Georgia Aquarium, as well as others, I feel that the Monterey Bay Aquarium cannot even compare because those aquariums offer many more things to see, including large marine life and those other aquariums offer a better experience because you can actually see the exhibits rather than just the backs of way too many people's heads.We purchased tickets at the local AAA office before arriving at the aquarium which saved us from having to wait in the long admission line outside.One of the most interesting parts of the aquarium was the exhibit at the bottom about Cannery Row and the former canneries, one of which is now the space the aquarium occupies. Thankfully this was one of the only places in the whole aquarium that wasn't overrun with too many people.For the high price of admission and how little time we spent in the aquarium given the crowds, it wasn't a very good deal. Unless the aquarium starts to limit the number of attendees or you are able to go on an off day where it isn't as busy, I would not recommend it.Update: The aquarium contacted me and apologized for any inconvenience I may have experienced. They said ""interest in the Aquarium is especially high during the summer season, spring break and major holiday periods. Outside of our busier seasons and times when we open new exhibits, our visitors levels are significantly lower, at times only one-tenth the attendance of our largest days. We have taken many steps to alleviate the problems-advance tickets, voluntary attendance limit, a suggested viewing route to improve crowd flow, auditorium programs, and special exhibitions to provide visitors with more options---all of which are designed to help our guests on busy days. Although it is an ongoing process to develop and perfect a workable system, let me assure you that we are actively striving to do so. The quality of our visitors' experience is our uppermost goal."" Here is a tip from the aquarium about when to visit when it may be less crowded: ""If you would like to visit the Aquarium when there are less people, our less-visited times are in the fall and winter months other than during holidays. At other times of the year, you'll find fewer visitors between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. During the peak summer months, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are the best days to visit."""
1730,2013-03-18,5,"Very clean, still manages to be modern, beautiful exhibits, great staff.Price is perfect. $34 dollars to experience something you rarely have the chance to during the weekly grind? I'll take it."
1731,2012-12-14,5,"I use to work at the Long Beach Aquarium, but this takes the cake.It was absolutely breath-taking and an amazing experience. The BEST aquarium I have even been to. I can't wait to take my little brother!"
1732,2016-11-30,4,"Great exhibits. Nice, clean environment and friendly staff. It is worth the cost of admission for sure!  The only things that in didn't like: 1. It was crowded! I wish they would limit the number of people admitted per day to less that what they currently have as the maximum number. 2. The cafeteria was a big mess! Finding an open table was very hard, and getting your food together is even harder. They get you to get in an out of 4 different lines to get: a soup, hot items, drinks, and cashier! The organization of the food service in the cafeteria needs a major improvement!"
1733,2014-05-01,5,"I have not been here since I was very little. I had to come here for a class. I was not excited. But the experience I had here was unforgettable.Walk into the open sea exhibit, and the first thing you see is a school of mackerel literally swimming circles around your head. The sight is amazing, and the ambient music makes the experience very ethereal. Watch jellyfish tentacles float like little sea angels... okay, I might be exaggerating here. But sit in from of the open sea tank (the big one). Watch the tuna fish, sharks, sea turtles, and pelagic stingrays swim by. Also, check out the ocean sunfish because that dude is crazy-looking.Wander around a little more and you will find many plastic bottle sculptures. Did you know how much plastic waste affects our oceans? The sight is one to behold, and as you stare at this wall of plastic in front of you, you begin to wonder how much there really is out there... The aquarium's mission is to inspire conservation, so after your visit, hopefully you too will think about how you can help the oceans!There are so many more exhibits to behold. Run around the kelp forest and watch little fish hide in the waving seaweed. Check out the crazy colorful fish that live with coral too. Right now, they have two special exhibits: ""Tentacles"", involving cephalopods (squids, octopi, nautiluses), and ""The Jellyfish Experience"", a psychedelic experience with a giant light up comb jellyfish. I think the Jellyfish Experience was supposed to be fun to kids, but I think a lot of them got scared, lol. Well we do fear what we do not know...I also REALLY recommend the touch pools. Come on! When are you ever going to touch a starfish in your life? There are hard ones and squishy ones. Same with a chiton. Do you even know what a chiton is?! Well you can touch one if you go to the MBA! Super fun for kids, they can be grossed out or they can have a cool experience. I touched a sting ray too!!The cafe uses all sustainable and local ingredients, so they practice what they preach. Have a delicious meal while you watch the waves at the waterfront. I splurged for a clam chowder bread bowl! Really creamy with decent chunks of clam and potato in it. The bread bowl was perfect for dipping!I'm a bio major, so I might be overly fascinated with what the aquarium had to offer. But even if you're a kid, a parent, a single, a couple, young, old, middle-aged, too busy to poop some days, I recommend you take some time for yourself and visit the aquarium.  I think you will have a great time!"
1734,2017-01-11,5,I have been here several times. Last time was about 7 tears ago. Just came back up. It always amazes me. They do an amazing job. They have added and changed so much. The octopus exhibit was great. The splash zone for the kids was another very cool spot. If you are going to have lunch make it early the cafe gets super packed very quickly. There is no other aquarium that even comes close.
1735,2014-06-02,4,"I have been to this aquarium 3 times over the past 13 years and enjoy it every time. I like that it's large, but not ridiculously huge. It's about a half day at most and then you can enjoy the shopping of Cannery Row or go to the beach. While I completely realize the staff cannot control how parents control their children, children are always the downfall to places like this. It's really frustrating to pay $40 and have to wade through children to get a decent look at exhibits. I don't even try to wade through the crowd when they feed the otters even though they are my favorite animals there. It would be really awesome if places like this followed the idea of The California Academy of Sciences and offered a ""Nightlife"" event. Every Thursday night, TCAS has an even called Nightlife that is 21+ only starting at 6pm and ending at 10pm. There are cocktail stands throughout the place and people dress pretty classy. No waiting in huge lines, no field trips, no pushing/screaming children, it's amazing."
1736,2014-06-10,5,"Very fun place to visit and the people are extremely nice and willing to answer all questions. Went during the weekday which was a little less empty, but nonetheless still full too.Felt the open sea feeding was overrated. Was expecting to see everything eat, when in fact they were just feeding the sardines, two turtles, and the sun fish. I suppose the school of sardines was cool to see, but was hoping to see Sharks eat, apparently that's a little hard to do as they do their own thing.The tentacles exhibit was very cool, one of the neater things I've ever seen when it comes to sea life.Great for kids as well."
1737,2015-11-22,5,"Like the deepest dream. I like the second floor exhibition: huge tank, meditative music and nice environment. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. Nice experience and definitely will be back if I visit Monterey again."
1738,2014-05-24,5,"Came here for the day with the family.It was great as usual, and it wasn't too busy. I miss the sea horses but the exhibit that took over was coo pretty cool, I think it was called tentacles.I really loved the jelly fish most of all.My baby was surprisingly really interested in looking at everything. We had a blast!"
1739,2015-10-01,5,A great place to get lost on a weekday. The dark rooms and the amazing fish are breath taking and if you go mid week you generally miss the crowds.  My favorite exhibit is the big dark room that has walls floor to ceiling.
1740,2015-06-14,5,"Excellent aquarium!  Great exhibits, nice layout.I suggest getting there about 20 min before it opens to find street parking.  (Cheaper than the nearby garages,)Getting there when it opens means you can do most of the exhibits before lunch. The crowds are lowest first thing.Bring a snack - the food is just ok at the dining area.  (Kind of bland and all premade,)Best tip: sign up for the feeding texts - we saw 3 or 4 feeding see would have missed otherwise!"
1741,2014-07-18,4,"I haven't been here since I was a kid and its mostly how I remembered it.The entrance fee was $40 for an adult day pass as opposed to the $70 Membership yearly rate. A lot of people signed up for the Membership at the door and I bet most of them won't be back as often as they think they will be.If you're looking to get a decent view/picture of any of the following animals, then either get there early or wait around until you can squeeze your way to the front of the pack: Sea Otters, Ocean Sun Fish, Sea Turtle, Tuna, and Penguins. No guarantees they will pose for a decent picture. What I really wanted to see was the Peacock Mantis Shrimp. I read about this vicious shrimp last year and they still had it on display. Unfortunately, it is located in one of the kid's tunnels so I really had to crouch down there and get a picture. Plus, it was so dark that I could barely see its brightly colored shell and my picture came out less than great. Some of the parents were giving me weird looks because I wanted to get a picture of this shrimp. There was no sign indicating what was in there so they had no idea why I went in there in the first place. I wish the Aquarium would move it to a more accessible area. That way grown-ups wouldn't feel like creeps crawling around in the kid's tunnel. They no longer have a touch pool where you can touch or pick up Leopard Sharks...but they still had the ones with the Bat Rays and various sea slugs. The aviary is fun. Especially when you see shore birds floating in the same water as the sharks. One of the indoor tanks connected to an open area outside and there were some large Pond Turtles in there but nobody seemed concerned when a bunch of seagulls and pigeons were trying to get a snack... The special exhibits about Jellyfish and Cephalopods  were cool."
1742,2015-02-28,5,"The employees are all outstanding, the attractions are top notch, and it is a very good educational experience for the kids."
1743,2013-11-16,4,"I really enjoy taking my family out for trips that are both fun and educational. The aquarium is an excellent place to spend an afternoon. There is lots to see and experience. My favorite exhibit is the seafood lunch counter. The diner is interactive and entertaining. But the otters are super cute, too.The films they show are good, and there are areas set up for tiny ones, too. Parking is often metered, so be sure to bring a handful of quarters with you to be safe."
1744,2015-08-17,5,"Went here on a Wednesday, it wasn't nearly as busy as it could have been. It was such a fun trip my favorite spot has always been the deep sea area. We also did the behind the scenes tour. It was 15 each but worth it. I forgot out tour guides name :/ but she was so amazing and passionate about her work so it made the experience even better."
1745,2016-10-02,5,Betsy led our otter tour and was very informative and personable. She obviously loved the otters as much as her job + was passionate about the aquarium's conservation work. Today was the experience of a lifetime! Definitely a check off the bucket list.
1746,2014-04-26,1,"The California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco has water fountains everywhere, educating visitors about the stupidity of trucking bottled water to stores and trucking the garbage to landfills. The Monterey Aquarium, not so much. Instead, they sell Norwegian tap water in oh-so-environmentally-friendly cartons for $3.75 a half-liter (about seven times the price of gasoline). How does shipping water across the Atlantic and trucking it across the continent help the oceans whose welfare the institution professes to promote???"
1747,2014-07-20,5,We've been members for over a decade now. I remember the year they first opened and the excitement I had as we waited in line for almost 2 hours to get in. That excitement is still the same for our 5 kids who have grown up visiting and learning about our ocean friends here at MBA. We visit at least 6-10 times a year and we always learn something new.    This summer we did the Sleepover at the Aquarium and slept next to our favorite Moon Jelly exhibit. This was an experience so well organized and thought out for as short of a time that they have in between operating hours. The staff really made us feel special and gave top notch customer service and education regarding the Aquariums goals and mission. The teen Naturalist volunteers were what made the night for our younger kids. They knew so much about what they were displaying and were genuinely interested in the kids learning.    My 10 year old was so motivated after learning one teen Naturalists story of how she became a volunteer there. Now she can't wait to volunteer in our local Santa Cruz  area.   Keep up the stellar work Monterey. You are definitely making a difference and changing the world for the better!
1748,2014-06-20,4,Pretty awesome aquarium as they have sea otters and penguins and jelly fish and all sorts of sea animals. The highlight though is the feeding they do in their open sea aquarium at 11am. They only do it once a day and it's pretty cool seeing them feed the fish ESPECIALLY the sea of Anchovies. 1500 Anchovies swarming to eat the little plankton that looked like dirt. Other than that the view outside in the back of the Pacific Ocean is memorable and you can also see otters out in the natural habitat on the rocks or swimming from the second floor view. It is kind of a small aquarium as I pretty much got done seeing the whole thing  in three to three and half hours top. The touching station was pretty cool also but the manta rays were being blah and didn't come out and want to get touched. They stayed in the one little black corner away from human hands. Also the birds or the pigeons I should say are not afraid of humans. i pretty much almost stepped on one and it stood it's ground. If your not from here I think it is a definitely a place to come visit since there's not really any other huge attraction than this in the area.
1749,2015-08-12,4,We enjoyed our visit to the aquarium but I do have a few negatives:1) Tickets are expensive2) So many people on the weekends in the summer...many of the exhibits were blocked by a bunch of people which got annoying after a whileOverall I think we would have enjoyed this after school is back in session and going on a weekday so it isn't so crowded.
1750,2012-03-27,4,"I am so in love with ocean creatures.  I could spend hours watching them... and I did just that at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.They have mahi mahi, rays, a sun fish and a sea turtle. There are coastal birds in an outdoorsish aviary and some sharks in there, too. There are mock tide pools where you can pet starfish (poor little guys getting pestered all day) and several tanks full of fascinating creatures to gaze at.  My favorites were the seahorses and sea dragons.  Such amazing little animals. My son seemed to really enjoy the puffins - especially at feeding time when they dive for the fish. We both loved the octopuses, even though they were sleeping.There are programs running all day in the little theater there.  It's good to catch a show and learn how science is borrowing ideas from sea creatures to put to use in technology or check out some clips of animals that live in the deep sea just off the Monterey coast.They have some kiddie areas, one for toddlers and one for elementary school aged kids. My son, elementary age, didn't really care for it.  He wanted to check it out when he saw all of the other children, but it didn't do it for him. He doesn't like his science dumbed down, so he wanted to split almost as soon as we walked into that section.The staff were great.  Every one that we encountered was very helpful and friendly.  One guy even told us some great stories about octopuses that had my sister getting teary eyed.There is a really nice area outside to walk around and get some fresh air when the crowd gets to be too much...The crowd.  So busy!! No wonder the price of admission is so high - less people can afford to come in and add to the chaos.  I think I would prefer to go on a weekday and deal with the school groups than go on the weekend with all of the adults.  The kids are going to run wild either way, but at least on the school group days you can see over their heads.  The weekend will greet you with loads of adults who are in the 6+ ft range who will stand in front of the crowd, sit in front of small children, and push through old folks and toddlers so they can get the best view... as if they couldn't see over everyone's head. So rude. Although I will say the afternoon crowd seemed much better than the morning crowd - calmer children and more considerate adults.If you can keep your cool in a crowd and want to check out some fascinating critters, make your way to the Monterey Bay Aquarium."
1751,2016-11-19,5,"Visted with husband on a Saturday. Great exhibits with friendly staff. Family friendly but felt a bit claustrophobic in some areas because there were so many kids! So plan to get there early to bypass crowd. But overall, great way to spend the afternoon when in Monterrey. Lastly, did appreciate their message on sustainability when it comes to fishing as well as caring for the environment. Both great messages to teach our next generation."
1752,2017-02-02,5,"This aquarium is great, everyone knows that. My review will be a bit different in that I would like the review the guest service, which was outstanding! Everyone you encounter is extremely knowledgeable and genuinely excited to share their knowledge with you! I would specifically like to mention Samra who went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience at the aquarium! She was the first face we saw upon entering, and we continued to spot her throughout the day. Each time she not only answered our questions in great detail, but also had other interesting bits of information to share with us, and was able to use our questions to point us in the direction of other exhibits she knew we would like. She taught us not only about the creatures on exhibit but also local ecology, how the aquarium is working to become as sustainable as possible thought their dining program, and other local organizations who are doing their part. She was a large part of our great experience and deserves to be acknowledged! In short, please engage the wonderful people working at the aquarium!! They will be so happy to assist you."
1753,2014-08-09,3,"Definitely geared for children and tourists. At nearly $40 per an adult which does not include parking it seems grossly over priced. Especially for an aquarium that took me and my wife two hours to complete. This aquarium just seemed below expectations, if I had kids I would come back. Otherwise, If you want to see marine wildlife that will create a lasting memory go to sea world. The Monterrey Aquarium felt like time wasted.How to better enjoy your visit.....If you really wanted to go to the Monterrey Aquarium be sure to get here right when it opens and avoid weekends. The Aquarium is located on Cannery Row which is a tourist loaded area with large crowds and minimal parking. If you planned to go shopping and browse the touristy souvenir stores on Cannery Row afterwards do understand the majority of stores close at 6:00PM."
1754,2008-01-23,5,"Fresh Review Jan 23, 2008We went to the Aquarium on MLK Jr. Holiday weekend.  We went there after 3:30 and were able to beat the crowds.  There were swarms of people leaving as we entered.Loved the current exhibit ""Wild About Otters"" featuring river otters in a large woodsy environment with lots of viewing areas. Loved watching them glide through the water~wanted to join them!The jellyfish exhibit is worth the price of admission alone.  It is hard to take a bad photo of any of them....er, ah, you can check out my pix and judge for yourself.  You are watching nature at it's best plus you can also imagine UFO's landing too!n a recent review a fellow Yelper mentioned screaming kids.  Yup, I noticed them too.  But as a former preschool teacher and a parent of a former crying toddler I can completely empathize.  3:00 pm is Colic/Beak down time for a lot of kids.  This is completely normal.  It's funny when our son was a toddler, it seemed like he was the only kid crying or fussing.  Now I see crying and fussing kids ALL the time. Where were they when our son was little?  My husband claims they did exist.  But I looked for them and never saw them.  But if you see a crying kid just ignore them if you can.  And give their parents a sympathetic smile--most are trying to deal with their screaming.We renewed our membership plus level which lets our entire family in for free for a year and includes express admission, 10% discount in the gift store and newsletters.  We also get two guest card that can be used by two people (with or without us) 366 days a year......very sweet!  Last year at least 20 of our friends( and their plus ones)  used the cards!  That's $1000 in savings! (Adult admission is $25)FYI  Cannery Row near the Aquarium is undergoing a MAJOR renovation. They are building a couple of MEGA hotels so the streets and sidewalks are torn up.   And hey my sock store seems to have vanished!Original Review Nov 2006Main problems with the Monterey Aquarium --too expensive and too popular therefore too crowded!I bought the membership that lets your family in for a yearand 2 guests anytime with or without you.Kind of pricey (but that's what credit cards are for!)but I love the idea of ""treating our friends"" to a day there.My fav exhibit is the jellyfish.Some of Mother Nature's best works of art!Wonderful interactive exhibits for young children (under 10),Our teen son said, ""Why didn't they have this cool stuffwhen I was little?""We've had luck going late in the day--less crowds;even Thanksgiving Eve at 3pm;  4-6pm very light.My other fav part is people watching.  Everyone there came to have fun!.I also love to ask people who are taking photosof their friends and family if they want me to take the photoswith them in it!Also GREAT GIFT SHOP.....jewelry, teeshirts, toysand knick knacks--some very reasonably priced.You can get a very cute otter stuffed animal for under $6."
1755,2015-08-05,4,"For young children this is a great aquarium. The layout is awkward, but I do realize that they used buildings that were formally other businesses which I think is great. Some of the signs are confusing along with the 3 levels, as when you are in the elevator there is only buttons for 2 levels. The touching area was great. It would have been neat if it was bigger and had stingrays in it to touch.  The jellyfish and the display were absolutely beautiful.   I did think there would be more to the aquarium. The most exciting part of my visit was sitting outside and we were able to spot a whale several times just off the shore. Wonderful sight that I would have never seen at the Georgia or Vancouver Aquariums."
1756,2009-11-20,5,"As a child I wanted to be a Mermaid. Which is odd because I grew up in Phoenix and rarely, if ever went to the ocean. Instead of indulging my oceanic passions in salt water, I would spend hours in our pool. I can hold my breath up to 3 minutes sometimes more. I would float near the bottom of the pool and watch my shadow on the bottom. Imagining my shadow was the Mermaid in the wild. So if you cant imagine at all but I love going to the Aquarium. I love it so much. I could spend hours looking at everything. Do you even know how bad I want to go swimming in one of those tanks? Except the one with the Hammer Heads. Those guys are way to fast and scary for me. I just want to go into that one tank with all of the kelp growing and flit around like a fish to. The Jelly Fish exhibit was really beautiful. It was like a bunch of 80's era peach and white prom dresses just casually floating around. Really mesmerizing. The touch ponds are some of my favorite. I could pet a pink Star Fish all day if I could. Oh, I also got to pet a real Abalone, kind of weird. However the skates didn't want to be touched. It actually seemed like they hated us and didn't want to be near people anymore. It made me sad. Now the Sea Horses. Who knew Sea Horses were so fricking cute?! The mini ones were the most precious things I have ever seen. Really hard to photograph but the most adorable thing under the sea. The Penguin exhibit smelled really fishy. They were cute and you could tell they were really relaxed and just chilling out in their habitat. My most favorite, favorite, favorite exhibit was the Sea Otters. I would give anything to be able to jump in there and swim with them also. My husband said they looked remarkably close to our Wiener Dog. They are so amazing. I love them. We even got to see a real wild one out in the open when we were standing outside over looking the ocean. Dare I say the Sea Otter is one of my most favorite animals. People are rude here and have no sense of their surroundings and also people let their children act terribly but forget about that. Focus on the fish and be patient until they get the hell out of your photo op. Maybe one day after I win the lottery or a mysterious relative leaves everything to me I will donate money to build a cool new exhibit and then maybe they will let me go swimming like the Mermaid I always wanted to be. Wanted to be? Who am I kidding, I still want to be a Mermaid."
1757,2015-09-12,5,"I love this place! The work they did to really showcase the ocean's wonder and beauty was incredible. It was expensive at $75 for 2 adults, it was crowded and the line to get in was outside and around the corner, However the staff were working as hard as they could to get the line moving and just that many people wanted to see the place. The cafe was also expensive but it was perfect for after we got done seeing everything. IF YOU LOVE THE OVEAN THIS IS A MUST SEE! FANTASTIC JOB GUYS!! I WILL GO BACK AGAIN!"
1758,2017-01-30,5,I was very skeptic about going to another aquarium. I'm from the Los Angeles area and they have one in Long Beach called the Aquarium of the Pacific. This place in that time 10 if that's even possible. The staff was extremely nice that and one lady offered to take us outside to show us passing whales. They were in the distant which is understandable but once they passed another lady was talking to a group of us about sea otters. Over all this place is beautiful and very welcoming staff was everywhere to answer any kind of questions we might have had.
1759,2017-01-29,3,"Pros: - Workers there were very informative and helpful. - Fun place to bring kids, they would have a good time.Cons: - Overpriced! Not worth the $50 cost of admission. - Kelp forest was not that exciting. - Penguin exhibit was very small.Overall: - Would not recommend due to high price of admission."
1760,2015-02-07,5,The aquarium is located in a very quaint town with lots of history and culture around it. We had tickets provided to us so I'm not sure how expensive it is to get in but there were alot of people on the Monday I went. Lots of kids but it was a very fun place for them to see. Upon waking in there's the sea otter exhibit. The windows could be a bit cleaner but the otters were so adorable it was still amazing to be that close to them. We got to see them during feeding time where they got ice cubes full of shrimp and they had to bang the cubes on the rocks to get to them. Smart little creatures they are. The Jellyfish exhibit was very cool. So many different species and the tanks brought out their unique shapes and colors. The huge ceiling to floor tank in one of the rooms will leave you in awe. One of the largest I've seen in an aquarium. I just stood there and watched as giant groupers and turtles and hammerhead sharks swam by. Very neat Aquarium. Took about two hours to finish both upstairs and down.
1761,2015-10-26,4,We are nearing senior citizen age but thoroughly enjoyed spending 3 hours at the aquarium.  Must rave about the jelly fish.  Seeing them up close and in spectacular lighting was quite an experience. We went first thing on Monday to avoid the weekend crowds. It worked!
1762,2013-02-04,5,"Alot of families and children at the aquarium that day, but then again, it was a Sunday. We found parking right across the street from the entrance and I'm pretty sure it cost no more than $10, which is nice considering parking at the Shedd, I'm sure, is at least that. Places like this make me want to move from the windy city to places near the ocean. I have always been an enthusiast when it comes to swimming, underwater life, and boating, so naturally, this place was right up my alley. I'm from Chicago and we have the Shedd Aquarium, but I hate to say I think I liked this aquarium a little better, aside from the huge cylinder shaped tank in the middle of the Shedd Aquarium. Only thing I was bummed about was the the sea otter exhibit was not open, not sure why. Funny that currently the Shedd Aquarium has a Jellies exhibit and at the time we came to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, they also had a Jellies Experience exhibit. Jellyfish just happen to be my favorite animal. I was totally excited to see them here. There are, I'd say, at least twenty different types of jellyfish here. The exhibit was much more vast than the one at the Shedd. They even had one type of jellyfish on that has never been put on display at any other museum: the Crown Jelly. It was definitely my favorite. Very beautiful white & purple in color. An employee was carrying around a little handheld tank with tiny little jellies in side. She invited us to go behind the scenes & showed us where the tanks are held, how they feed them, and that the tanks are cylindrical shaped so that the jellies do not get stuck in corners. We sat and had a beer at one of the cafes on the balcony before proceeding to the second half of the museum. The museum is located right off the shore; a very beautiful layout and nice, scenic spot. I really enjoyed the seahorse exhibit and there were several types of fish (or some kind of underwater creatures) that I had never seen before, like this white slug-looking thing with two horns on its head. The coral reefs were really cool, too."
1763,2012-06-27,5,"I'd have to say that this is probably the best aquarium I've ever been to. At first I was skeptical, especially after paying the expensive $35.00 per person to get in here. I was visiting from NYC and was no stranger to overpriced admission fees but this place was worth every penny. The the entire design and layout of the exhibits were well thought out making the experience all the more enjoyable. Yes, this place is a little lacking in the shark department but they more than make up for it with the jellyfish exhibit. I've never seen anything else like it. Different worlds of jellyfish dance and light to the fascination of many onlookers. I never realized how many different varieties there were. The same goes for the seahorse exhibit. The sea otters were also fun if you happen to catch them when they are frolicking and swimming about. They also have numerous touch pools for a hands-on experience. The Bat-Rays were the highlight of those tanks. This aquarium is a must-visit if you are in the Monterey area. Take a break from the touristy shops along Cannery Row and rest assured that this is actually something that is money well spent."
1764,2014-07-06,5,"I love it here! Everyone who works here is really sweet and attentive to kids. All the exhibits were really informative and it isn't hard to find your way around the aquarium at all. I would suggest going on a less crowded day though, all the people and crowds are a little exhausting (although I did come here 4th of July weekend, my fault). The crowds take away a little of the experience, but the staff is really great about catering to kids."
1765,2015-10-21,5,"Great fun, informative and awe inspiring place. Great for kids and adults, the work they do with preserving the oceans and animals that call it home is incredible."
1766,2014-05-24,1,"I wasn't impressed by this place At all. The $40 price tag doesn't help at all. The few exhibits are pretty, but jellyfish get boring quickly. The place was also packed: elbow to elbow, people pushing, kids screaming. It made it difficult to enjoy anything. For being one of the ""best"" aquariums it didn't have much to offer. We visited today to check it out before we took family who are coming to visit soon and I'm glad we did. It's not worth our drive and we only wasted $80 instead of closer to $300!"
1767,2016-07-26,4,"Wow!! What a unique experience. This aquarium is fabulous. There was something for everyone. My 6 month old, 3 year old, and 7 year old we're all happy! Every staff member was very well trained and very helpful. My only complaint was when they did the feedings, they need to come up with a better concept for 50+ people to watch ."
1768,2015-01-26,5,"One of my favorite places of learning actually got better with age! Several years ago, we were members when we lived in Santa Clara County and our children were young. It was an incredible aquarium back then. After an impromptu visit this past weekend with our now adult children, we rediscovered what a gem we have in our own backyard! The exhibits are fantastic. All of the speakers were very knowledgeable AND entertaining! The cafe fare was healthy, fresh, and full of flavor! The shows and feedings are spaced apart perfectly so that before you know it, you've spent the entire day there. And, everything is clean just like it was when the aquarium was new! So glad to be members once again!"
1769,2012-08-28,5,"The Monterey Aquarium is absolutely great! Wonderful aquariums, exhibits, and educational shows.  The feedings are interactive and really intriguing.  The jelly fish experience, secret life of sea horses, sea otters and HUGE aquariums can't be described with words. Also the cafe inside is really good! It doesn't get much better than this. A beautiful city, a magnificent aquarium, and great food.It makes a wonderful day for couples, families, and everyone else in between. I'll definitely return here again one day."
1770,2016-10-03,5,"A fantastic experience. I have been here several times in the past, but the latest trip was the best. The Kelp Forest and Open Sea exhibits are unique. We sat in front of each one for at least 20 minutes and zoned out.They also have two touch zones with adults and kids can touch abalone, crabs, kelp, and other strange creatures while learning more about marine life.The cafe had well prepared food at fair prices.One thing I'd like to see less of is the marine activism. You know, eat less of this, lobby your representatives to ban that, here is some abstract art by unemployed young people who should be doing something more productive with their lives, etc. We went to the aquarium to lose ourselves in appreciation of nature, not be blasted with political messages. The aquarium ""exploits"" marine life for dollars, too - it's not like the fish are free to go wherever they want, either (I don't have a problem with this, by the way, I just don't like hypocrisy). Plus, the art exhibits were boring in comparison with the rest of the aquarium.Overall, a great experience and would gladly pay the $50 to return again and again."
1771,2012-08-27,5,"Cali Vacay 2012 review*This was really the highlight of this vacation. I'm not sure it could have worked out better if I had spent a week meticulously planning my visit. We arrived just in time to hear the Jellyfish lecture, which made the Jelly exhibit a lot more interesting. They do a wonderful job of making the lecture compelling for kids and adults alike, and the Richard Attenborough-y lecturer was just perfect.After the Jellys exhibit, we spent some time just going through the aquarium looking at everything. I can't imagine the amount of work (and money) it must take to keep this running so nicely, and I love that most of the docents I heard speaking were volunteers. After our self-guided tour, we got to watch the sea otters being fed, which was one of the dearest things I've ever seen. I loved getting to see their little hands and flippers and movements up close. The commentary during this is really interesting as well. We went to the Sea Otter movie ""You Otter Know"" after the feeding, but that was really geared more toward kids and set up in a game show style. But it was funny and the woman who hosted it was funny and very good at her job. We spent a little more time going through MBA after the sea otters, including seeing the puffins (which I have always loved), going out on the deck to observe the seals sunning themselves and look down into the water to find more jelly fish. After a quick trip through the gift shop, we went upstairs to the kids area and there I got to see the penguins being fed. That was fun, but that enclosure felt more zoo-like and wasn't as unique as the sea otter feeding. All in, a really wonderful day that I will remember for a long time."
1772,2016-11-26,2,"On Sat, Nov 26 2016, they let thousands of ppl in, and it was a fish market. I had to get my 2 kids out of the aquarium as soon as possible. Any small disturbance could get ppl injured in stampede. I wonder if there is any city restrictions on it, or not. 120 bucks wasted"
1773,2014-07-10,4,"Oh, how I love the aquarium. To be honest, this aquarium was just alright. It did not live up to my expectations, but was definitely still enjoyable. This aquarium is very kid-oriented, especially the new exhibits. I went on a weekday and there were a ton of school groups that came for a visit. Avoid if you can!Student tickets cost around $35. A bit of a hefty price for what you are seeing. There are parking structures around the area for parking, or street parking for 2 hours. We paid around $10 for structure parking on a weekday which was located on Foam St.What is the MUST SEE exhibit? Definitely walk through the OPEN OCEAN! You will not regret it. Once you step into the exhibit, you look up into a school of fish swimming through the whole circumference of the room! It's amazing! When you keep walking, there's more schools of fish, a lot of jellies, and others. At the end of the exhibit, there is a great viewing hall which I deem is the BEST place to sit for hours. It's a gigantic tank that houses several different types of fish and turtles! There are a lot of tunas, different types of sharks, sea turtles, schools of fish, and a SUN FISH! That alone is a reason to go. This is one of the few aquariums that have sun fish because their tank is large enough to support it! A must see!Another thing to see are the nautiluses and the cuttlefish! They're amazing! You can walk outside to see a great view of the Monterey bay! So blue!This aquarium is not as large as I thought it would be. We finished everything in around 4-5 hours. The only disappointment I had was that it didn't have a tunnel."
1774,2015-06-09,5,"I will be getting a membership.  I plan to become a regular.  It was great for kids and for me with lots to see, do, and learn.  My favorite was the big deep blue sea tank...I could sit there all day just watching the sharks and turtles.  I also enjoyed the tentacles And jellyfish areas.  When I go back my goal is to spend more time with the sea otters.Go.  You will not be disappointed."
1775,2014-11-01,5,"Plan on spending at least 2 hours (longer if you have kids) at this gem of a place in Monterey! TIP #1: Entrance fee is rather steep ($35 - 40 per person), but there are usually people selling discounted tickets on Craigslist -- do buy from those who will actually escort you into the aquarium instead of from scammers selling fake/expired tickets! Tip #2: Visit montereybayaquarium.org/… for a complete schedule for the day of your visit; Open Sea Feeding @ 11 AM was THE BEST!"
1776,2012-05-31,4,"I'm a lover of aquariums (My ultimate goal is to go to the one in Atlanta btw! ) and although we have the Long Beach Aquarium, for the price you pay it doesn't quite give you what you pay for. I've also been to the Mandalay Bay's little aquarium, but that's waaaay overpriced but of course you're in Vegas so that's to be expected. I had never been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but opportunity presented itself when I had to take my nephew to Monterey to visit his cousin who's father is stationed up there (in the Army). Since we were driving him up there and I had the vacation days, why not go check out the aquarium?! Formerly a sardine cannery, the aquarium is home to hundreds of different species of aquatic life including their 300,000+ gallon Kelp forest which is the highlight of their aquarium. My favorite things to see where the Jellyfish, Seahorse exhibit and the giant Tuna tank! I've seen Tuna on television, but you don't have an appreciate for how big they truly are until you see one up close. The seahorse exhibit was neat because I never knew there were so many species existed. The leafy seahorse was my favorite! It was really hard to see at first, but once it swam away from the vegetation you could see it in full view. Anytime I think of Jellyfish I'm always think of Crush from Finding Nemo and that line ""Swimmin' with the jellies"". Call me weird (you'd be correct and I'm proud of it), but jellyfish are always cool creatures to me. Yes they can kill you if you touch them, but some of the ones they had on exhibit had bio-luminescence so it was neat to see them create their own light. To get the best value of spending your time here I recommend coming right when they open. We did that and were able to get through the entire aquarium sans the crowds because they were always a few exhibits behind us. Afterwards when you're finished you could check out cannery row which is also pretty nice if you come when the marine layer hasn't arrived (it comes quickly up there). This is the best aquarium in California hands down !"
1777,2014-08-31,4,"I've wanted to come here for forever, and it was everything I hoped it would be!We came on a holiday weekend Sunday, and the line to get in was blocks long. We bought tickets on line while standing there (no ticketing fee!) and waltzed right it.The 15 minute shows in the theater room were not movies, like I'd expected, but more like TED talks. They were really well done.My kids liked all of the hands-on exhibits, the computer games, the things they could touch and play with. And the penguins. I liked the sea otters, the jelly fish and the sharks. And the leaping blennies, they are like parcour fish. But what we all appreciated most was how spread out the exhibits were. We could take in little bits of information at a time instead of all of the fish jumbled together like they do often are at aquariums.To get a discount on admission, consider a city pass, combined with entry to other San Francisco attractions. But even though it was expensive,  I didn't begrudge the price, because of all the research and conservation the aquarium does."
1778,2015-01-13,1,"Like jail for fish. I can still see the sad little eyes of a fish that seemed to say ""get me outta here!"" I haven't been to a zoo in fifteen years after witnessing a profoundly depressed chimpanzee...and now I can cross off aquariums. This is a very successful enterprise...tons of people here and lots of kids ( I was here on homeschoolers tour day- oy!) my opinion is, if we can't preserve ocean habitats in nature, I would rather have everything gone. It seems ironic that the beautiful ocean is right out the doors of the aquarium...and a pathetic ersatz facsimile which is raking in bucks is in the doors of this aquarium. And honestly, if anyone can partake of fish and chips at the cafe...they have a stronger stomach than I. I will never return."
1779,2015-09-29,5,"This place is amazing, especially if you have time to come back over and over again. My wife and I have annual passes, which paid for themselves after two visits. This aquarium is unlike any other in that it's primary goal is education, not entertainment. So everything has a purpose, and their sea otter restoration program is second to none.The clam chowder is also better than any of the places in Lighthouse ave that I have tried. Give it a shot!"
1780,2015-06-30,4,"Love this place! Haven't been since I was a kid, so it was nice to see as an adult. Admission is kinda steep, considering we could not find any coupons anywhere, but despite the price, I would still recommend checking it out. Amongst the highlights of our visit were the deep sea exhibit, which consisted of gigantic varieties of tuna, Sharks, and several schools of sardines. It is enormous and such a wonder to be around something that makes you feel so small. We were fortunate enough to catch the jellyfish exhibit before it was changed out as well as the newly placed Tentacles exhibit, both of which were mention worthy. Being a classic rock fan, I could appreciate the Hendrix quotes on the wall of the jellyfish exhibit and all the far out decor. Thee highlights include the otter feeding and the coral life tanks. There is also a nice play area if you have little ones under ten."
1781,2014-03-23,4,"I came here on a Sunday around 1pm and parked in the lot on Wave. It was $10 all day and just a 5 minute walk. I had two members passes but my parents had the senior discount so I believe it was $65 for both. That is pretty damn pricey but it goes toward funding research and maintaining the aquarium. We watched three 15 minutes video shows in the auditorium and explored the two levels in 2.5 hours. There are multiple sections that specialize in certain sea creatures such as jellyfish, sharks etc. My parents really enjoyed seeing the gigantic tank with the hammerhead sharks and going to the touch room where they touched the stingrays. You can check out sea otters, birds, schools of fish and all those goodies. It gets pretty exhausting walking the whole place and thankfully there are benches throughout the area. It sorta made my jaw drop when the tanks reached the top of the ceiling and I was just consumed with the water and fish. It got repetitive after a while and the visit to the aquarium seems like a one time thing for me. The food at the cafe is expensive and gets crowded so there is a line to enter the cafe. We spent over $40 for four people which included clam chowder, pizza, fries, and a salad. You can bring your own food into the place since they dont check bags and it would totally save you money.**TIPS**1) Make sure you get a map that lists the shows and exhibits that occur throughout the day.2) Enjoy!"
1782,2009-02-11,5,"Just what a 5 star rating should be... as good as it gets! There is so much to see. So much to do. So much to learn. Everything is presented in a fun way. You learn, without anything being boring. I LOVE THE SEAFOOD WATCH! You come away knowing a bit more about how the food choices you make impact the environment. They make it so easy to be informed. With the little pocket guides, and the email alerts, you can easily make a difference and get involved!"
1783,2017-01-12,5,"Walking through the exhibits at the Monterey Bay Aquarium is tranquil. Even on a busy day, the aquarium does not lose it's charm. The attention to detail the MBA team bring to their ecosystems is sure to please people of all ages. If you go for one thing make sure you see the salt water tanks & the sea otters."
1784,2013-01-04,5,one word to describe this place: SPECTACULARThat's all that needs to be said about this place.  Went on Xmas eve and it was the best choice of adventure for the day.
1785,2016-06-10,4,"Great aquarium set in the naturally beautiful monterrey. The outdoor views with the seas lions/seals (I think they have an array of both, still can't differentiate them lol) is a free bonus that you don't need to visit the aquarium to enjoy. The aquarium is solid - great variety of creatures, the best little activities for kids compared to other aquariums, and very nice videos running in their theatre all day. It's one of the pricier aquariums, but the money goes to good efforts and is in line with the demand/visitors. The Baltimore aquarium, which I am very familiar with, probably has a greater array of moderately to larger sized fish but I'd say all the other unique features makes the two on par with each other."
1786,2015-02-18,5,"One of the best aquariums out there! Make sure you make time to see the feeding and go to the auditorium for their shows. Lines can be long on holidays, but they do a good job of making sure everyone gets to see the animals during feeding times and moving people through the ticket lines.Please make sure to turn off flash for photography. I still see people taking pictures with their flash on even though at every show the staff always remind visitors to turn their flash off for picture taking inside the aquarium."
1787,2014-08-18,5,"I could spend forever here. Like seriously. It's no secret that I hate crowds, but I braved the crowds for the aquarium. There's something for everybody here - it's always fun to see the jellies & the fish feeding, and the otters are SO cute. But my favorite by far is the deep sea exhibit. I could watch the sharks & turtles swim all day everyday. It's so relaxing, and I don't know... there's just something about it that's so serene.That being said, I also love being able to touch the rays & such. So much fun! You know how some things seem SO COOL as kids & then you come back as an adult & are disappointed? I was so scared that that would happen with me & the aquarium, but nope. Still the same feeling of awe."
1788,2018-01-10,4,"Great facility, amazing exhibits and great location in picturesque Monterey. Well worth the visit, but be ready for the crowds. The price is a bit high, but it is one of the best aquariums in the country, and many of the funds go to helping local wildlife."
1789,2014-06-10,5,"Best aquarium I've been to! This place was awesome! From inside the aquarium with their amazing displays to the outside views of the incredible ocean, everything was just top notch. I would highly recommend this to everyone."
1790,2017-06-26,2,"I found the aquarium to be a poor value at $50 per person. It was incredibly crowded and overrun with children. I heard crying and parents scolding children for approximately 120 minutes out of the 120 minutes I was in the building. A lot of the floor plan is devoted to things that are not living marine life e.g. video/CGI exhibits for children and a play area. I came to see real sea life, I can watch Planet Earth at home. They don't appear to have any truly large marine life, the sharks and fish are on the small side, the hammerheads look like juveniles. One exception was a massive sea bass in the kelp forest tank. Maybe I'm jaded as a scuba diver but I found the aquarium only moderately cool and overall unpleasant when the crowd and cost are factored in. I'm pretty surprised by all the 5/5 hype on here."
1791,2018-01-08,3,"Warning: If you believe animals are more important than yourself and fellow humans, are an environmental extremist or easily triggered, don't read my review. Move on to the five star reviews for parking info and visiting tips then just go and enjoy the experience. The jellyfish exhibit alone is worth the hassle of finding parking and walking an extra mile. Seriously, it is. Those five star reviews nail it on that exhibit.OK, you've been warned, no punches pulled.I love seeing the variety of sea animals in their beautiful exhibits and learning about them. However, I don't worship them or the earth. I certainly don't want to pay a 50 dollar per person tithe to enter an environmental worship centers. I am a little over 40, born and raised in Cali and am well aware environmentalism is the state religion...but come on! The number of signs, exhibits and the forced mentions of human destruction in the feedings presentations were beyond ridiculous and insulted my intelligence. I know we weren't in the minority on this since 9 times out of 10 there was literally no one looking at that stuff. If you didn't heed my warning and are really into that, then I'm going to preach to you about what I learned at a very quick glance. Obviously, since you're on an electrical device that was transported by diesel you need to go pay your carbon offset penance first. Now that you've done that here are the most important commandments to get you back on track. You can't use anything that uses oil or gas or you might just be the cause of an oil spill. You are not allowed to eat any seafood unless it's labeled with an authentic seal of sustainability. Also, you are not to use any plastic whatsoever since it will end up in the ocean. Better yet, just don't use anything, or the toilet. It will end up in the ocean. I think that just about covers it all. For the rest of us, do whatever recycling/conservation floats your boat. Relax and enjoy life without worrying if an ocean bird gets choked by a net. It will be replaced for your photoshoot before it's dead and the bottom feeders will get a little snack. Everybody wins :)"
1792,2016-05-03,4,"Withholding one star because...well...captivity.  But this isn't Sea World.  This place is a true rehab facility and each year they rescue, rehab and release many many animals.  No one is kept prisoner to perform in shows, like at Sea World.  It's also a huge world class research facility, and houses the only indoor live kelp forest.  They make a point of drawing the connections between what we eat and what happens to the planet, which I appreciate greatly."
1793,2014-09-08,4,"From the few aquariums I have been in my life I think the Monterrey Bay Aquarium is one of the best ones. The place is huge, they have a huge variety of sea life. What impressed me the most are the feeding shows, they are incredible. Additionally, from what I researched, this aquarium is one of the fews in the world to have a Sunfish (mola mola) the biggest kind of fish existing in this planet. So if you ever get the opportunity to go around I will definitely recommend you to take a look at it. The entrance fees are pricy but totally worth it, at least for a first time."
1794,2018-01-02,3,"Good overall Aquarium. Loved the Jelly Fish exhibit. Did not find any big sharks, as I believe they were already release back in the wild. Good time spent with kids. Did not try the onsite restaurants/cafe but they seemed good and had a good ocean view."
1795,2015-11-04,5,The best few hours I have spent in a long time. From the moment I arrived I was amazed at all the options to view and interact with sea life and plants. The feeding exhibits are a must. The volunteers are a wealth of information and the staff is friendly and approachable. Really enjoyed eating at the cafe and looking out at the bay.
1796,2016-09-12,5,Relaxing lovely place. Thought it would be larger. Parking is a hassle... very enjoyable but unfortunately the tank with swarms of fish going overhead is under construction for awhile.. enjoyed watching the varieties of jellyfish
1797,2012-01-31,5,"After years of talking about making a trip to Monterey and seeing the Aquarium, we finally made it.  I should clarify that my husband works at Shark Reef Aquarium in Vegas, we both love anything science or biology related, and we are giant nerds.  But you don't have to be a nerd to enjoy this place, and it's a definite must visit if you are in the area.The highlights of the visit were the puffins, the Monterey sea birds, and the giant Open Sea Exhibit featuring sea turtles, a scalloped hammerhead, and a sunfish.  We also really enjoyed the views of the bay from the outside deck areas.  My husband, a fish expert, was enthralled with the seven gilled shark and cuttlefish.Like any good aquarium, you will find exhibits with penguins, sea horses, jellyfish, and a touch pool.  These are the things that tourists love the most and Monterey made sure to have all of the above.  I can't lie, I love to see me some penguins too.  The entire upstairs area is geared towards children with bright colors, games, and a tank featuring the fish from ""Finding Nemo.""  We quickly ran through this part of the aquarium.Like everyone else has said, this place gets crazy busy.  We got in around 3, which I think was a good time since it seemed like a lot of people (that is, large families) were leaving.  It doesn't give you a ton of time since the aquarium closes at 5, but if you can run around quickly then you'll still have time to see everything.  If you are more casual or have children, then definitely give yourself several hours to make your way around the building.  I would recommend going right when the aquarium opens.My only real complaint is that everything is sprawled out and you wind up backtracking a lot through the building.  ""Did we go over that way?  That doesn't look familiar,"" was a common line my husband and I were saying during our visit.  Make sure you take a good look at the map when you first get in and have a game plan ready on what you have to see and what you want to avoid.  Chances are you won't get to everything in one visit; either you'll run out of time or some areas will be so crowded that you'll just want to skip it to avoid all the people.Be prepared to do some walking, get run over by a couple strollers, and most importantly enjoy all the beautiful exhibits.  Try to learn something new and definitely make sure you find the information on Monterey's Seafood Watch program."
1798,2014-01-23,5,"Bedazzled flip flops.  Hairy chests.  Steaks on the grill.  What can I say?  I enjoy staring at beautiful things.  The fishies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium are among my favorite beautiful things to stare at.  My favorite tanks at the Monterey Bay Aquarium include that swirling one with the sardines in a big silver vortex and the open ocean one with the giant yellowtail, hammerhead sharks, sea turtles, and sunfish.  That sunfish.  It looks like a giant head just swimming around.  Trippy.  I also like all of the jellyfish tanks, especially the tanks holding the deep-sea jellyfish with pulsing bioluminescence like the Las Vegas strip.  As someone in my group stated, this would probably be a good place to come after getting really, really baked.Christ Almighty, but there are a lot of children here.  Stroller city.  Bring hand sanitizer.The aquarium is well-run and well-staffed, so the exhibits and facilities are in great shape even though they must get thousands of visitors in here a week.My favorite place to be is the outdoor amphitheater above the tide pools.  If you stand at the railing, you can talk to staff members and use the binoculars and viewfinders to see all kinds of wildlife in the bay.  In just ten minutes or so, we saw dozens of otters in the kelp, cormorants, Rizzo's dolphins, fish, a jellyfish, and even a beautiful harbor seal right up close.  You can wave to the people paddling across the bay in kayaks, too.Tickets are a heart-stopping $40 for adults, $35 for students and seniors, and $24 for kids.  Come early, bring a sack lunch or get your hand stamped for re-entry, and get the most for your money."
1799,2015-08-28,4,"Excellent displays. My 10-year-old loved it, as did we adults. The sea otters were a favorite. Petting the rays was so fun. Neat gift shops (multiple). Good cafe also - lots of tasty choices; my hamburger was very good.Only downsides - it is a little pricey, there is no good place to park (well, the whole city is like that), and I wished that they would have been open to at least 7 p.m. so that we could have seen more of the aquarium after an all-day conference kept us occupied until 5. As the aquarium closes at 6 pm, there wasn't a lot of time to enjoy it."
1800,2016-06-17,5,We bought a membership because this place is great! It gets crowded during the busy season. The volunteers are amazing and my kids love the touch pools.
1801,2015-05-31,4,"This weekend my son and I spent time in Monterey. He is 8. I took him to the aquarium amd he loved it. The exhibits were awesome. The information about each species was offered in bright and large lettering for kids to read. There are so many interactive activities for kids. The prices in the gift shops are a little high. I spent $30 on a stuffed animal. The feedings were really fun to watch. We got there early and beat the crowd. It only took us 3 hours to tour everything, and that's with a bad back! My only complaint is that they had little water for drinking. I found one water fountain downstairs. For somebody disabled I would have liked a few vending machines which sold bottles of water for emergencies. Other than that the visit was great and we would come again!"
1802,2012-04-11,4,"This place is smaller than I remember but there is still a lot to see!  My favorite exhibit was the new live jellyfish exhibit, his was the playful sea otters.  We had a really great day watching all of the presentations and moseying around by ourselves, checking everything out.  When we wanted a break, there was a lovely patio and wrap-around wharf at the backside of the building to catch some fresh air and sunshine.Minus 1-star for not offering any discounts during the off-season or ever."
1803,2015-02-16,4,"Great way to spend half a day.  Kids love it here.  Walking through the ""deep sea"", ""open sea"",  and the ""tough tank"" are some of the must sees.  The colors of the sea are beautiful.  Children are able to experience first hand touch and feel.  Sea experts are in site to answer any curious questions. Over all experience is great! Check out the pics!  Awesome!  Ciao!"
1804,2014-08-15,5,"Best aquarium ever, hands down. Well worth the price of admission. The deep sea tank is a wonder. The jellies exhibit is entrancing. Don't wear socks, they will just get knocked off anyway at the monterey aquarium.  Go there today!"
1805,2014-04-12,5,"World class aquarium! It's hard to beat an attraction that is both enormously fun and quite educational.The exhibits are terrific... to get so up close and even personal with the various sea life the Aquarium has on had is an experience that is hard to beat. The feeding shows are great; they show and tell you so much about the animals in such a short amount of time and seeing the interaction between the staff and the animals while feeding is so neat. The programs and films presented in the auditorium are also terrific.The Aquarium is very well staffed and there is always a staff member or a volunteer nearby ready to answers questions about an exhibit or help you out in any other way. The food service is good. The quality of the food is very high for this type of facility. The prices are about on par with a similar type of attraction.The admission fee might seem a bit steep, but it is well worth the price. I would recommend purchasing a membership, as you can come back all year for just a little more than the price of a single day's admission. As an example, on my recent visit, the cost for a single day admission for our party of four was $140. The cost for a membership for two adults and their children is $195. So, I paid the additional $55 and now we can go back to visit any time we would like to for the rest of the year!"
1806,2015-10-26,4,"OVERALL: Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great place to learn about The Pacific Coast, The Ocean itself, and marine life within. PROS: The Aquarium is very well organized and provides it's visitors with an abundance of signage so that one does not need to worry about being lost. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly, and almost every exhibit provides an interactive way to learn about and ""explore"" the sea. CONS: The cafeteria food is good, but expensive. However, everywhere in the Cannery Row area is overpriced due to the heavy tourism that it draws. Which leads me to the second part; the aquarium can get extremely crowed during the summer and other common school breaks. NOTES: The Aquarium is a fantastic place to visit if you're in the Monterey area, but try your best to visit during the off seasons so that there will be a lowers volume of people. If you have any questions, visiting the very knowledgeable information desk. If you leave, but want to return later in the day, don't forget to get a stamp on your hand by a staff member so that you can enter back in without paying again!"
1807,2015-04-21,4,"It is amazing to see all the different sea life/creatures that calls the MBA their home. I haven't been here since I was a kid and it was a priceless moment just to watch my own kid now press his hands against the glass to see the different fishes/sharks/etc.I do suggest going on a weekday. We were lucky to find street/meter parking. I knocked off 1 star for their cafe. The food is slightly overpriced and didn't taste that good. Ham and cheese sandwich was too salty. Clam chowder had a lot of stuff in it but too salty. Kid's meal hot dog with fries- the bun was soft but the outer layer of the hot dog was chewy/leathery, I had to peel it off in order for my kid to eat the hot dog. The fries were hard. Maybe, we'll eat out of the restaurant next time and come back to the aquarium."
1808,2016-10-09,4,"Enjoyed. If you have a couple hours to kill then go. However, the lines were long so go early or save wait time. Interesting and educational. Learned about a couple new creatures I didn't know existed. The kids that were running around seemed to love it."
1809,2012-06-12,5,"Growing up within driving distance of both Miami Seaquarium and Sea World, I am a tough customer for aquariums. This place knocked my socks off. First, the kelp forest was unlike any tank I have ever seen. The simulated ocean currents, keeping the kelp swaying in actual ocean-like movements was hypnotic. It seemed like they just built a glass wall to the ocean outside, it was THAT natural. I have been snorkeling and diving all my life, and this tank pretty much had you feeling as if you were diving while standing right there.Then the corals, jellies, seahorses... all brilliant colors, mind blowing camouflage, eye popping spectacles. One thing after another, each tank sparkling clean and full of healthy fish.The water birds were adorable, diving against the underwater current to chase bits of food. We stood there for way to long, just watching these guys. The multiple touch pools, manned by knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and friendly staff were a special treat. How often do you get to tickle three types of starfish to get them to show you their bellies?! The deep sea tuna tank... O...M...G... It starts as you walk under the vaulted ceiling of sardines... YES... sardines - living, swimming, shining, circling sardines... IN THE CEILING! Wow. If I were Bill Gates, I would have that as my bedroom ceiling. I was stunned. Then you look around, and there are more windows in the walls where you see more sardines - swimming in a giant loop current around the perimeter of the room. Awe inspiring. Then you walk up to the enormous wall of glass to see speeding schools of tuna, zipping in and out of sardines for a snack. Look to the bottom and you'll spot the scalloped hammerhead shark clearing a swath among the small fish, like an oppositely charged magnet. A sunfish floated strangely against the wall, minding his own business because everything thinks a sunfish is just weird. The 'outdoor condo' (as I called it) was a glass patio area where the top of the kelp forest washed into a mini shoreline where a bunch of adorable shore birds ran about, nesting, eating, exploring, in the best real-estate in the city. On the other side of the room was another tank of rays and flounders to pet if you are brave. The jellyfish exhibit still burns in my mind. Strange glowing alien creatures, floating in space.... so strange... and my favorite part - the nursery! Behind a corner of one of the jelly tanks, there was a window into the fish hatchery! The real science behind the machines - you see all the little tiny fish fries floating in their tanks and how the progression of tanks works as they grow... so interesting! If you have 3 hours in Monterey Bay, it would be criminal to miss this landmark of ocean experience.Experience Note: if you are expecting the big splashing Shamu shows, this is NOT the place for you. This is more of a science museum instead of an amusement park. You will learn, you will see, you will touch... you will not sit in an ampetheater to get splashed by a captive killer whale."
1810,2014-02-28,5,"Okay so they definitely didn't have ""The Jelly Fish Experience"" (a play on words of ""The Jimi Hendrix Experience"") when I was a kiddo. This psychedelic interactive jellyfish world cannot be missed!  It does get crazy crowded so avoiding this place on this weekends will elevate your experience. They also give out a small surprise if you are heading their for a birthday or anniversary so make time to stop by the info booth. There is a new octopi exhibit coming out in April, that looks incredible. I really love how the Monterey Bay Aquarium places a huge emphasis of conservation efforts. The critters here seem really well taken care of as well. Another lovely part of visiting the aquarium is that its right by the downtown by Cannery row, so after you leave there are lots of food options and places to shop just a short stroll away."
1811,2015-05-16,4,"My family tries to visit once a month. My son's favorite exhibits are the clown fish, the octopus and the penguins."
1812,2014-07-17,4,Very fascinating... Although hard to enjoy with so many people there. Way overcrowded.
1813,2014-06-07,4,"Came here on Memorial Day weekend, S.U.P.E.R. C.R.O.W.D.E.D.! The exhibits are impressive as expected! The education on sustainability was great, now I know what not to order at sushi restaurants. The shows in the auditorium was informative, now we know the great white shark is nothing to be afraid of (except when it's hungry). The jellyfish fish exhibit was beautiful, the sardine whirlpool was kinda funny (imagine over a thousand little silvery fish going in loop over and over again.. where are you going?). The outdoor patio gives you a great view of the Pacific Ocean. Everything is as best as it gets for an aquarium. The only downside is that you may not want to come in a long weekend, it was so crowded we got the sardine experience! I guess that's why the aquarium is in Cannery Row!"
1814,2015-11-27,4,"Nice spacious restroom. Nothing too special about it. Has a baby changing station, 4 sinks (one for small kids), 3 stalls, and three urinals. The restroom was very clean and looked like it's kept that way."
1815,2016-12-18,5,So fun for everyone!  Kids loved it. The staff is extra nice and really cares about your satisfaction.  Will go again for sure!
1816,2014-07-09,5,Beautiful place. Lot's of different undersea species. The ambiance was relaxing. I enjoyed this experience very much
1817,2015-03-30,4,"I love aquariums and animals in general. I was excited to visit the aquarium, since I have not been here since I was in elementary school. The tickets can be a bit pricey, but it is a non-profit so I did not mind it too much. The food costs however are another story. The food prices are similar to ballpark prices or amusement park prices. It cost 3 of us over $50 just to have a pretty basic lunch.When it comes to the aquarium itself, it was great! My favorite attractions were the jellyfish and the large aquarium in the auditorium. Everything else was pretty cool but you can see a lot of them at other aquariums. Overall it is a wonderful place if you love sea creatures. I would recommend visiting this place at least once just to experience it and see =the beautiful creatures."
1818,2015-10-02,5,"Stopped here on our honeymoon. Such a beautiful place. Fell in LOVE with the jellyfish, I could spend days in that exhibit. Seriously mesmerizing. The staff was knowledgeable, great experience."
1819,2014-01-11,2,"Overall, the experience here was utterly disappointing. My family and I would have to agree that the admission here is overpriced, and it's really not worth the time or drive.People make the attractions seem amazing through pictures, but when you actually get here, everything is just so dull.I would have rather stayed at home and watched HD marine life instead of driving 100+ miles just to see a whole bunch of people stuffed in tiny rooms. I felt that this place was mostly geared towards kids, and everywhere you look - kids.They could have at least had dolphins, at the VERY least. The Open Ocean attraction which was supposedly supposed to be a look into how the ocean is only had turtles, tuna, schooling fish, and a couple of sharks.The only thing worthwhile to see were the Jellyfish. They were pretty and plentiful, which is why I added an extra star to my review.Overall, don't waste your time to hear crying, screaming, and rowdy children all over the place."
1820,2012-04-20,5,"I've been a member of the aquarium for about fifteen years now.  While our memberships in Bay Area museums come and go (we rejoin the Academy of Sciences and SV Tech every four to five years for a year or so), we just won't let our MBA membership go.  We get down to Monterey a few times a year, and we ALWAYS stop by to see what's new.  This time, it was the Jellyfish exhibit.  Not really my fav theme (kinda modern music with pulsating lights off jellies...sorta silly), but nonetheless, educational and fun.The Outer Bay exhibit is ALWAYS a great place to just stand and watch for a while.The Kelp Forest remains a fav...yeah, I prefer the real thing, but standing there looking at it is close....and there's no gear to clean afterwards!:-)Words to the wise.  NY Day.  BAD time to go.  First sunny weekend on the coast of the year....stay away.  Labor Day weekend...ditto.Other than those guaranteed insanity trips, generally it's not too crowded (although it will ALWAYS be somewhat), and it's worth it.Become a member while you're there.  TONS of benefits, and there's that whole ""feel good"" thing."
1821,2015-05-02,4,"Love this place!! Avoid on the weekends if possible.Moved to the area and went ahead with the membership (tax deductible as charitable donation if you itemize, so why not??). We love visiting here and couldn't recommend the membership enough! Cool member perks: (extra visiting hours for members only, membership news emails, membership entrance gate to avoid crowds). Also, it's really nice to walk through the aquarium without the need to see it all in a day. If an exhibit is crowded, simply skip by it knowing that you'll be back soon enough.Expensive for single-day admission, but love the membership!"
1822,2012-09-19,5,"Someday, I think that I'm going to work here...or at least, I'd really like to. How cool would it be to constantly be surrounded by beautiful and intriguing creatures of the sea...First off, this has got to be the largest aquarium I've been to - we easily spent 6-7 hours here, and it's a pretty convenient layout. I also like the fact that they revamp the exhibit, but still keep the old ones such as the octopus tank, touch pool, and large open sea tank with turtles and sharks.Their latest exhibit is the ""Jellies Experience"" which had a 70's-hippie type theme and featured some really cool jellies that I've never seen before. WIth the mirrors, lights, and atmosphere, it was a pretty neat experience I think.The auditorium shows are pretty cool as well. First thing Kathleen W., Brian Y., and Kelsi K. did was hit up the Sharks presentation. I enjoyed the curator's witty jokes mixed in with the overview of research that MBA is doing on Great Whites.Be prepared to pay quite a lot to be able to enter however...MBA is like the Disneyland of theme parks...the San Diego of Zoos...but if you're an ocean animal-lover like myself, you'll love going here and coming back :D"
1823,2012-07-15,5,"Some say that Disney Land is the happiest place on Earth, but for me, it's the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Either that, or it just makes me the the happiest person on Earth. Traveling to Monterey and NOT going to the aquarium is pretty much out of the question if you're traveling with me...unless I'm visiting Monterey with my high school girl friends.I find that the aquarium is always super busy, and really, that's the only negative point for me. It gets so crowded that it can be difficult to appreciate all of the exhibits. This time around I barely got a peek at the sea otters. But seriously, if there was some sort of emergency evacuation, it would be disastrous...way too many people in there!At just under $35.00 per adult, it's definitely on the pricey side, but oh so worth it! This aquarium is one of the best in the country and I'm happy to help keep it going because their research and conservation efforts. All of their exhibits are well maintained and beautiful. They have a sea otter exhibit, Penguins, Open Sea, Kelp Forest (that is an actual view of the bay), Coral Reefs, Deep Sea, The Jelly Experience, The Secret Lives of Sea Horses, Giant Octopus, Monterey habitat exhibit, and an auditorium. I could spend an entire day here (sans all the little running around in circles)My two favorite exhibits are the Jelly Experience and the Secret Lives of Sea Horses. The updated Jelly Exhibit is phenomenal! Truly gorgeous and psychedelic. I'd say the the only Jelly most people know of is the Moon Jelly, but here you can upside down jellies, elegant jellies, spotted jellies, flower hat jellies and more! I love that we capture them on camera too. This exhibit is not to be missed.The secret lives of Sea Horses is just as special as the jelly exhibit. Sea horses are just about the cutest sea creatures out there and they have about 15 different species on exhibit, making it one of the largest in the nation. They have dwarf sea horses, potbelly, yellow, zebra nosed, etc. My favorite of all time is the leafy sea dragon. Again, this exhibit is not to be missed!Monterey Bay aquarium is more than a place to admire awesome exhibits. They are leaders in  research and conservation for Great White sharks, sea otters (which are on the endangered species list), tropical coral reefs, etc. I love this place and look forward to coming back!"
1824,2015-02-16,4,"This is a great place to spend the day. The staff is very knowledgeable. If you plan on coming back with the family, spend the extra money on the membership."
1825,2014-02-23,2,"In my opinion this place is highly OVERRATED. Probably only great for kids. The jellyfishes were the only really cool things to look at.. But for almost $40/adult, not worth it. You'll see more children with DSLR cameras and smartphones taking pictures of the sea critters than actually seeing the sea critters! Plus I hated how it clearly said ""No flash photography"" and yet people would just be busting out their flashes anyway. Maybe I'm just not an ""aquarium person"", but I enjoyed strolling the beach/wharf and seeing the seals and kelp way more.Glad I went to see what it was all about but I seriously doubt I'll go back."
1826,2016-07-17,5,"Took visiting out of town family on this busy weekend to the Monterey Aquarium and we purchased the regularly adult $49 admission tickets for $30 at the Presidio Navy base all online! (My beautiful wife GLORIA rocks when it comes to a lot of things to include getting monster deals!) I've been to the world renowned Atlanta Aquarium which is fabulous but I do believe for children that love to interact with the sea life this aquarium is as good and even better in some aspects than Atlanta. Clean, efficient, educational, and dedicated to insuring you walk out with an improved environmentally friendly knowledge base! Did you know farm raised salmon should be avoided and is not environmentally friendly as a sustainable fish because the farms extremely pollute the environment?!?! ME EITHER BUT WE DO NOW!  I suggest you go during the week when schools in to better enjoy this great experience.  The food at the cafe, (I had clam chowder and a great high end freshly made while you wait sandwich) was superb!"
1827,2016-05-28,5,"Planned a trip here for my daughters third birthday and it was amazing, she loved every minute we spent there. We spent a good 5hrs looking and exploring everything and she was never bored it was actually hard to get her to move on she was so excited by some of the exhibits. Definitely a place to take the little ones. Also had two older nieces with us as well and they loved it too"
1828,2014-03-07,4,"I had been pestering my husband about bringing me here since I found it months ago when we decided to move to California. We finally went and it was as awesome as I had hoped it would be.We went on a Sunday at around noon. The Cafe was pretty busy around that time, but we didn't eat there or anything. The crowds weren't super bad, but there were still plenty of people for it being a Sunday. The little panels were all super fun to read and there was a lot to see.The Open Ocean exhibit was by far my favorite thing to see. Truth be told, fish kind of freak me out. So when I read online that they had an ocean sunfish, I had to see it, even if it gave me the heebie-jeebies. Which it totally did but it was so awesome. They also have an octopus, a bunch of jellyfish and otters.Of course, they have the usual aquarium animals, a couple sharks, some penguins, ""Dory"" and ""Nemo""; all still fun to look at. The coolest thing about the aquarium (that isn't fish) is the purpose of the aquarium. It's all about education. It was founded for the purpose of educating the community and restoring the ocean around Monterey (which was previously overfished) and today is considered one of the best aquariums in the States.The ONLY reason this gets a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is due to the fact that although it was a awesome, beautiful aquarium, I somehow felt like the place was over glamorized, I expected to be taken to a dream land, or to put it in better words, my expectations for this world renown aquarium was much higher. Again - awesome, beautiful, fun, cheap, are all words that come to mind, I just expected it to be a tad better then other aquariums that I have visited that do not hold titles like ""world renown"" and ""best"" in the united states.All in all, I was not disappointed at all, and wish that we could have stayed longer to look at it all - we definitely will the next chance we get. I highly recommend you visit at least once, and bring your kids if you have any! They have an awesome play place for them to run around in.Check it out. Support the aquarium. :-)"
1829,2014-04-12,4,"It was definitely an experience visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium. D and I were in Monterey for the weekend and though we weren't planning on making a visit to the aquarium, we ended up going anyway on a rainy Saturday! There was a long line to buy tickets but it went by quickly so don't let the long line that leads outside deter you. My favorite exhibits were the jelly fish and the sea otters. The sea otters were so cute just floating and swimming around. I couldn't stop staring at the different sizes of jelly fish. I can't decide if I liked the small ones more or the big ones...The two downsides of the aquarium is the expensive ticket (~$40 for an adult ticket) and the crazy crowds. I love kids but oh gawd I do not like a huge amount of crazy kids. It was pretty hard to enjoy myself with people everywhere so I would definitely recommend visiting the aquarium on a weekday.(14/100 in 2014)"
1830,2015-09-17,5,Amazing.I have brought my children here three times over the last two years (They are currently 3 1/2 and 5).Visually amazing aquarium.The food is actually very good as well (a bit pricey though).We LOVE this place!!
1831,2016-05-15,4,"Took my kids here.  The kids and myself absolutely love this aquarium.  It's filled with aw-inspiring beauty of all the aquatic creatures that we don't get to see unless we come to places like this.  There's a nice area to sit and take a bite while your in the aquarium and even a theater to watch awesome videos,  we've been in there a couple of times (these movies are free and only play at certain times)  I will start making plans to come back soon with my family."
1832,2017-01-01,5,Best place to see the beautiful animals if the Pacific ocean. My favorite places are the octopus and jelly fish areas. Just mesmerizing.
1833,2014-07-20,5,"It was our first time at Monterey Bay Aquarium and we had a really fun time learning about the different animals of the sea. My favorite part was the open sea and coral area with the 'Nemo and Dory fishes' and my hubby's favorite part were the jellyfishes. Both of our boys had fun interacting, playing with the different stations/activities and watching all the animals.It was beautiful outside, tons of nice scenery photo opportunities. We had lunch at the cafe upstairs, we ordered a burger, grilled chicken sandwich and clam chowder soup in a breadbowl. Prices were steep but it's convenient and food was really good.We ordered our aquarium tickets while booking our hotel at the Hyatt. We received 2 day passes for the price of one. Worth it!"
1834,2014-09-23,5,"I went here a while back and decided to write a review on how much I loved it. The atmosphere is amazing and it is never boring there is always something to look at and do. It is a very large aquarium and wherever I go, I have to go to the aquarium because it is one of my favorite things because I love the ocean and aquatic life in general. This ranks as probably my second favorite following one in Spain. It is fairly cheap and amazing for kids to go to and just enjoy and learn in a fun environment. Recommend it!"
1835,2011-11-13,5,"Whenever I reach the 100th mark on reviews I always try to write up something special. I researched the Monterey Bay Aquarium and noticed that it has had over 1200 reviews but since this was my number 300 and my niece's first visit I decided to write this special review. My niece, girlfriend and I visited the second and newer half of the Aquariium with the large ocean tank, the sea horse exhibit, jelly fish exhibit and the tuna/shark fishing synopsis.In the big tank there are dorados, tuna, giant turtle, schools of sardines plus a fearful hammerhead shark swimming with the masses.  All of this is visible by a 90 ft window, truly unmatchable. I thought there were great white sharks n the tank but I guess not.The seahorse exhibit was very intriguing and I don't recall ever seeing seahorses. I didn't realize this but the different oceans have there own species. The Aquarium had different displays of seahorses and they elaborated that males can spawn offspring (that would make them asexual). One of displays showed seahorses perform a dancing ritual to entice a mate, strange that happens all the time with humans. I thought the jelly fish exhibit was almost 3-D movie like. The jellyfish move so gracefully in the water and their pink and orange color was very eye catching. I decided to take a video with my droid so I would have a souvenir that I will never forget.The tuna and shark displays were the cause and effect type, where there is a handle to change the display to show the events that occur. There was mucho text to read on the displays but fortunately I had my nine yr old niece be my personal docent and reader. I didn't realize this but the newer nets have traps to release the turtles when the boats are long netting for tuna. I better start reading the green peace activist brochures.  Remember please don't order the shark fin soup in order to preserve the species.I thought overall that this was a very rewarding experience for the niece, girlfriend and I. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is very well thought out, very captivating and great place to visit at any age. Having a childhood flashback I recalled at one time I wanted to be a marine biologist but my first deep sea fishing trip changed that very quickly. I have never witness so many people tossing their cookies all at once, that made me queasy. I think it is better to visit the sea life in this type of setting.Truly Five Stars!!"
1836,2014-10-31,4,"This is a tough one to review.  I did enjoyed it very much, but not quite a 'fan'.  But it's definitely more enjoyable than an ""A-OK"" kinda experience.  So four star it is.  So if I was a member with annual unlimited passes, I may even give it a five star review.  The simple truth was, while I enjoyed and appreciated the aquarium, I think it is way overpriced for average tourists.  Now, add in that this average tourist does not have kids, which cuts about 25% (if not more) of aquarium content... it becomes ridiculously overpriced.Don't get me wrong, the exhibits in the aquarium are beautiful.  We spent a good 2-3 hours and had a great time.  But, the price for single entry just seemed really steep when compared with other comparable aquariums.  I mean, I am not talking small amount different, but more like 25-35% in price difference.  Having said that, I can spend a long time just staring at some of their wonderful large tanks like the Kelp Forest.  The jelly exhibits are beautiful and surreal.  If I were to live in the area, it would be a no brainer for me to get annual membership and escape to the wonderful world of sea creatures."
1837,2014-08-18,2,"Let me start off by saying the following: I REALLY wanted to love this place. I REALLY tried to ignore the insane crowd and difficulty moving around and enjoy the aquarium. I tried my best, and yet the unbelievable amount of people crowding the Monterey Bay Aquarium was too much of a hindrance to actually enjoy the exhibits. The biggest point of interest on my trip to SF wasn't the wonderful food. It wasn't the sightseeing or the wonderful walks that SF had to offer. It was actually a place 2 hours south of SF called the Monterey Bay Aquarium. As a kid (which was almost 2 decades ago), I remember reading up on world aquariums, and hearing about how the Moneterey Bay one was world-renowned and a must-visit. I held onto that fascination into adulthood, even going as far as to putting the Monterey Bay Aquarium near the top of world destinations, right beside the Galapagos Islands. Being so close geographically to it, I knew it was only a matter of time before I was able to visit it. So after some fun time spent in SF proper, my fiancee and I drove an hour down to San Jose, and prepped for an early next morning to head down another 2 hours to Monterey Bay. Unfortunately, our mini road trip was marred by 3 separate traffic jams, and instead of arriving in Monterey Bay by 10am, we arrived at 1pm leaving us with 5 hours to zip through the aquarium. Around the aquarium is a cute seaside town, not unlike you'd find in Oregon along the 101, or even Vancouver with Steveston. As it's a major tourist attraction, parking is really at a premium. Since we arrived late, most of the all-day parkades were closed. However, we got lucky and one opened up as we were circling around looking for more parkades. Once we arrived at the aquarium, we were able to zip past the insanely long lineup with the help of our CityPass (again, highly recommended if you are in SF for a week and find the other attractions interesting). Once inside, we were greeted by a gentlemen asking for a bag check. They are very strict with outside food, but the gentleman kindly explained that, if we really needed a bit, just step out of the aquarium with a hand stamp and then eat. I thought that was a real nice thing to do, since he could've easily confiscated all food items.As for the aquarium itself- it's pretty small. There are 2 wings, each with 2 levels along with some outdoor observation decks. If it isn't too busy, you can probably see all the exhibits in 2 hours. But there lies the rub- the place is always busy. Reading reviews prior, we expected the aquarium to be quite busy, but I didn't expect it to be ""Tokyo subway during rush hour"" busy. If I wasn't bumping into parents and strollers, I was accidentally walking into kids (or is it the other way around?). As cool as some of the exhibits were (I really enjoyed the open ocean and the coral reef exhibits), the whole experience felt like a chore. Perhaps it would've been different had we not been jaded earlier with the traffic jams. I suppose it's easy to say that we made a mistake planning a trip for a summer Saturday. But based on the aquarium as a whole, I've experienced better (to the point that I've grown a greater appreciation for my local aquarium). My advice to prospective visitors is to avoid coming in the summer, and pick a random weekday morning. I think with the aquarium much less busy, it'd be easier to enjoy the exhibits and appreciate what great work they're doing at the Monterey Bay Aquarium with respect to conservation and education. But days like the one I experienced makes it seem like the aquarium is just a commercial venture trying to take money from as many tourists as they can (which they're well within their rights to). It makes me really sad to have left with such a sour experience. This was something I was looking forward to since I was a kid, and as much as I'd like to come back and give it another chance, I strongly believe that I can get the conservation message they're trying to convey, as well as a more pleasant viewing experience, elsewhere. And for significantly cheaper."
1838,2014-08-10,2,"I was disappointed with the aquarium. After hearing so many people rave about it, I was looking forward to going. We drove down from SF for the day, on a Saturday. It was very crowded, and it only took 2/2.5 hours to see everything. We listened to one lecture in the auditorium, which was educational and interesting! Also...$40 is ridiculous! I rather put that money towards a ticket to sea world, and have a whole day of exploration. If you have never been to an aquarium or seen marine life, you may have a better experience. There is also a large kids area, and interactive areas. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Overall we are glad we went, but never need to go back again."
1839,2017-10-29,5,"Love the aquarium, their exhibits and the staff! My toddler loved the feeding exhibits - great place to spend a perfect weekend"
1840,2012-02-02,5,Visited this place recently after about a 10 year hiatus and it was even better than the last time.  Love that they have such an incredibly big saltwater tank...I can honestly just stand there and watch for hours and find it very relaxing.  I really like how the aquarium has some themed exhibits about pollution and preserving the various sea creatures and even has a guide on ordering seafood etc.  Would come here again and again...no aquariums on the west coast compare!
1841,2016-10-03,4,Love picking choices in drinks or bottled. Love the quality of coffee(tasty). Meals great. Friendly cashiers.
1842,2016-10-02,5,"Awesome place.  Just a beautiful place and well ran.  I have been there several times with my children and they have loved it.  Talk about a historical site, it used to be a cannery.  How better to give back to the ocean it took so much from than to educate all on the importance of a healthy ocean?"
1843,2012-05-08,4,"Came here not too long ago, and the Jelly fish exhibit is pretty ""groovy!!""I love the lighting and all!! The theme was pretty much 1970s, Austin Power all the way.The Jellyfish pictures on my camera came out really nice--i think it was due to the lighting in the exhibit. The Aquarium is right next to the beach (about 10 minute walk).My review may be biased since I don't go to many aquariums, but Monterey Bay Aquarium is very well kept and very clean. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest to come early and witness the Open Sea feeding since there is only one feeding per day. This was probably the highlight of my day, besides the jelly fishes."
1844,2016-11-26,5,"I haven't been there in a while, but I went today and had a lot of fun! One thing that's a bit annoying is how crowded it is, but otherwise it's great! I really enjoyed the tentecles exhibit"
1845,2016-06-04,5,"I have been to many aquariums, ocean themed theme parks, and even some fish shops, I love to be around fish and ocean wildlife. Monterey Bay Aquarium is easily the best place to see so much sea life up close, to learn about it and to actually feel like you're there. There is so much to do and to learn, that if you take the time, you can walk away with a deeper appreciation for the environment that is ¾ of our planet. All the displays, tanks and shows were top notch as they showed not only how so many factors and variables in the ocean work in perfect concert to create an environment to flourish, but because of the magnitude and scale of the Aquarium, it is presented in a way that is understandable and quite frankly fun. So often we go to places of fascination, to experience, to learn about a topic, a subject that piques our curiosity, and so often we will walk away from an experience we thought would enlighten us, to quench that knowledge thirst, just disappointed at the lack of relatability or sheer preponderance of information presented in a way that can be dull, inconsequential or just plain inaccurate. Monterey Bay does none of that. It presents the information, it shows the animals in their environment, in ways that anyone, from children to grizzled adults, can share in and have fun. You can walk away with a smile and with knowledge that dwarfs your understanding you had before you entered. It shows how these ecosystems work together while showing you a glimpse into our own past with a display of when it was a cannery. It teaches us to appreciate the ocean. If nothing else, it is a few hours of fun."
1846,2016-11-26,5,"Spectacular! Took the kids here during their school break to get them off the couch and off their phones. They loved it, especially the sharks and jellyfish. We spent the entire day here and there was not a single boring moment."
1847,2012-09-07,4,"Great place hands down. Has some history of the previous Cannery structure (great preservation) and some amazing exhibits of sealife.Lots of kids and tourists so be ready to deal with kids and slow people but overall a great experience if you have kids or don't have kids.Probably one of the better aquariums I've been to although the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago and the large on in Atlanta would be better (but who cares, it's still amazing).One thing which is not the aquarium's fault - people who spend expensive amounts of money on cameras that have no idea how to use them: STOP using the flash in an indoor environment with fish behind glass. It DOESN'T work. Oh, and take a photography lesson if you're going to get such an expensive piece."
1848,2014-11-19,4,"Dropped by here to celebrate an anniversary.The place was clean and larger than what I expected.Many different exhibits, showings, and feedings throughout the day.Once we got the schedule for the day, we planned around it (I recommend doing this, so you have a set plan). Got to see the Open Sea feeding at noon, the Luna sea otter presentation, the presentation on the Deep Sea, and all the exhibits surrounding it.You don't need to buy the exclusive behind the scenes package, you many not have enough time in the day to see it.Takes about 3-4 hours, taking your time, to get to see everything.You can bring in your own food and drinks, so pack your family some snacks!Bring your kids, they'll love it!If you have AAA use your discount to buy the tickets at the offices first!"
1849,2015-10-21,4,"Yes, the $40 adult admission is pricey, but the experience definitely is worth the cost as long as you budget at least 2-3 hours to explore the various exhibits and floors.  If you can go during the week (avoid the weekends), do it.  If you get a chance to view the live feedings, do it.  Just take your time and enjoy."
1850,2015-02-16,4,"I came here on Valentine's Day and the line to buy your tickets was very long but luckily I bought my tickets online so I was able to bypass the line and go straight in. Spent 3-4 hours here, going through the different exhibits and watching each of the feeding shows. This place is really cool if you have never been before. My favorite exhibits were the jelly fish and finding nemo tank, since they look so beautiful in the water as if they were glowing in the dark. But after a while I feel like some of the tanks get a little repetitive since you see a lot of the same fish in different tanks."
1851,2017-11-25,5,A wonderful aquarium showcasing local Monterey Bay life as well as exhibits from other areas.  More than enough to see for a whole day.
1852,2014-02-11,5,"The first time and only time I came here before recently was when I was really young. From February 3-9 ,they were offering free admission to those who reside in the Monterey and Santa Cruz counties. My friend and I came down here on a gloomy day and decided to check it out on the 9th right when they opened at 10am. Obviously, the word FREE attracted MANY families and college students out here on the last free admission day, and boy it was so crowded! I know general adult admission is around $35, but I guess it might be worth paying that much and not having to deal with tons of families and strollers in the way.Otherwise, the exhibits were all really clean, well kept and organized. The people who worked there offered us a map right when we got in. The aquarium is only two floors, with roughly 3 or so exhibits on each. My favorite: the jellyfish experience! I feel like that one is really popular just because it makes jellyfish look so appealing with  every detail being crystal clear. So cool! They also make great instagram pictures too. I also really liked the ""seafood"" bar idea where they give you information on the seafood dish that you ""order"". There were still little shows going on, such as feeding and talking about the lifestyle of these aquatic animals. They even let you touch some starfish or sea anemone. This aquarium is definitely family-friendly and really cool to go to once in a while. There's also a cafe if anybody gets hungry and doesn't feel like exploring the other food place along Cannery Row. I would like to see what other new things they bring to the table in the future!"
1853,2014-05-31,5,"I've been to several aquariums in my time, as I'm rather fond of fishy friends. And this is it. This is the best aquarium I've been to. They've got all sorts of different exhibits with fish, birds, and a whole manner of sea critters. Fabulous. I like touching all the starfish...Watch out though, the admission fee was steeper than I anticipated!"
1854,2017-09-28,3,The best public 'cafe ' attached to a tourist venue we have been to in the last four days.Lots  of healthy choices and plenty of good seating.
1855,2014-07-21,4,"The aquarium is a lot of fun for the whole family. We have been two times now and even our baby who was less then a year both times was amazed by everything there was to see. :) They have great kids activities to keep them involved and hands on. It is really expensive for the one time day pass however my husband and I are both full time students and they have great rates for college students memberships, its only 15 more dollars then the day pass and you can go all year! Also your pass is good all day, so we went and got lunch and came back later, and when it was to busy we left and went back after ""rush hours"" The only real draw back for us is how busy it is. We went a Friday day hoping it would be less busy but I guess everyone else had the same idea. We could barley move the stroller through the crowd. We decided to ditch the stroller and just carry baby the last half of the afternoon because it was just to busy for the stroller."
1856,2015-08-17,3,"Good! Its an interesting aquarium, but not much different of others. The view of the bay is amazing. But thats all.Bom! É um aquário interessante, mas não tem muita diferença frente a outros. A vista da baía é linda, mas é apenas isso."
1857,2012-02-05,3,"A fun aquarium but quite expensive ($33/adult) and not quite as big as we had hoped. We saw most of the museum in 3 hours. We thought the highlights were the large open tanks of sealife (the open sea and the kelp forest). The jellyfish and the comb jellies were pretty cool too. There's currently a seahorse exhibit on which was fun to explore.There were also a number of touch tanks (with starfish and skates) that were great for the kids. Also, the place gets quite cold so bring a jacket.A fun afternoon but not one we'll have to repeat anytime soon."
1858,2014-03-30,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great place that treats the animals humanely and focuses on educating the general public on Marine wildlife (PLEASE recycle everyone and don't endorse or eat anymore shark fin in soups). It's also nonprofit and the animals look happier as opposed to Sea World. Yes, admission is expensive, but it goes to maintaining the aquatic wildlife as well as paying the staff.This place is wonderful for kids as they have the Splash Zone and Touch Pool, but for those who do not like children, this place might not be so great for a date. I personally don't mind children as I know I would have loved to have experienced this as a child.My personal favorites in this aquarium include the Sea Otter exhibit, the puffins, penguins, seahorses, and the Open Sea. It's also always interesting to see the Jellies in their brilliant, vibrant colors as well as their shapes and sizes. Actually. I think it's safe to say I love all the exhibits because I'm a big animal person.I love having educational experiences when I go somewhere, so this place never fails to add more knowledge into my brain. I love the tidbits about the great white sharks and how sea otters are so clever to repeatedly bang a shelled critter against a tank or rock to break open shellfish to eat. I don't want to spoil anymore tidbits for those who haven't went, but this is definitely a place to learn and absorb yourself into the sea, which to me, feels like a whole new world (*cue corny Aladdin Disney music).Tips:1. BRING A CRAP TON OF QUARTERS FOR PARKING (yes, I'm talking at least 20. You know how you get change when you pay cash whenever you go somewhere? Designate a jar for a future trip to the aquarium, SF, or any wharf.)2. Go EARLY because this place can get crowded.3. Buy your tickets ONLINE and print them to bypass the crazy line for tickets4. If you are in college or high school, BUY THE STUDENT TICKET, saves you a good $5.5. If you plan on visiting this place more than twice a year, invest in a $50 student membership or an adult membership.6. Although the auditorium does not have any live animals, they provide so much educational value and information on what the aquarium does for these animals and who've they brought into captivity to nurture and release back into the wild7. Have a bite or lunch break at the Paris Bakery a mile or two down in Monterey - it's a delicious, affordable place to have lunch instead of the nearby expensive restaurants8. If you think this place is huge, that's highly relative. Many people come disappointed in how small this facility is, but I am big on the quality of marine life. But that's just me.Recommendations:1. Watch the penguins being fed at either 10am or 3:30pm 2. Watching the Kelp Forest at 4:00pm when the diver comes in to feed all the fishDefinitely going to be seeing this place again soon!"
1859,2016-06-03,3,"Haha, I am amused to see my old review criticizing the admission fee when the price has gone up in the past 5 years.Most importantly, I'm here to say this: having gone a couple times in the past year, both times we spent about 1.5 hours here.  I wouldn't expect to spend more than 2 hours here.  (Maybe with little children your experience will differ, I don't have kids, I don't know.)So don't feel bad showing up 2 hours before closing time.  It does still feel pricey ($50 per person full price, $40 student), but what else are you going to do in Monterey besides kayaking, whale watching, and hiking?  Nothing.  NOTHING!Friend says the aquarium in Houston is better.  Step up your game, Monterey."
1860,2016-09-06,5,Definitely worth it! We took our 7 yr old here for a little Birthday get away! The ocean life is spectacular! My family and I will be back again.
1861,2016-10-20,5,"This aquarium is amazing. They do a great job of making it fun for both kids and adults. Very educational with a great variety of animals. Some of my personal favorites was the open sea tank which had two hammerhead sharks and some big tuna! I also loved that the aquarium has some outdoor areas that you can look out and see wild life. If your lucky you can use their telescopes and spot some awesome animals like otters and harbor seals! Overall, this aquarium is a great gem in Monterey!"
1862,2014-03-12,5,"The last time I was here, I was in 1st grade and came here with my class on a field trip. I know there wasn't much to look at in the 90s, so coming here really as a first-timer after all these years was wonderful. I came here with my fiancé while on a very small getaway with him. I got my tickets 2 weeks prior to coming to Monterey, so I was able to cut the huge line by just going to willcall (highly recommend to do because the lines looked ridiculous when I got there). I loved everything about the aquarium. It was just a place to feel relaxed and enjoy the marine life around you.The only downside I feel was how crowded some of the exhibits were and one part of the aquarium was a little musty and the air just felt heavy down there (I think it was where the octopus was?). But that doesn't really make much of a difference because I truly did enjoy my experience coming here and I hope to someday bring my kids here once my fiancé and I start our own family."
1863,2017-10-19,5,As always enjoyed the aquarium. Haven't been here since i was a kid but it was just as i remembered.
1864,2017-11-17,4,"I have a big appetite, and was surprised to see how big the sandwiches were. They were tasty too. The soup was very good and is available in a BIG bowl. And finally, to enjoy it all with a beer and a great view of the bay made lunch an enjoyable experience. If only we had also eaten there the day before instead of eating lunch at a so called restaurant on cannery row.....UGH!"
1865,2016-05-02,3,"I love the aquarium and the incredible work they do. the only down side is the fact that they let people take flash photography constantly. in fact, during our visit, we couldn't really enjoy any of the views of the fish and animals because it was so overcrowded. there were literally people taking video with their ipads while they were standing in front of the jellyfish. i mean I know we all like souvenirs, but damn- be in the moment.there are signs everywhere about the light sensitivity the creatures have, but the staff does nothing to stop it. when i asked a member about it because i was concerned for the octopus in a tiny tank with nowhere to hide if stressed, and he just shrugged. he seemed apathetic at best. it's really hard to find places to see wild and exotic creatures that aren't exploited. the aquarium is one of the best options out there in terms of the rehabilitation work they do with the creatures, how they care for the bay, their research and conservation...but with that volume of visitors everyday- there needs to be a way better strategy for keeping visitors and they tech in check."
1866,2017-11-17,5,"The best aquarium in the world, except all the ones I have never seen.  Great place to take out-of-town visitors to show off the Peninsula.  Maybe a bit pricey but worth it."
1867,2014-11-23,5,"Great to enjoy this aquarium and get a family pass. It allows you to take guests with you all year long. Love that they have docents scattered throughout the museum to educate the kiddos and answer any questions raised by the adults in the group.Kiddos are always entertained by the touch tanks, waterfall room, and all the interactive exhibits! Fun gift shops complete the experience!"
1868,2014-07-16,5,"I love this place so many creatures. Nothing that doesn't blow my mind.My favorite part would have to be the Sea Otter Feeding, Shark Habitat, and the Jelly Fish Area.So Cool. I hope I can go back there again next summer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1869,2014-05-05,4,"My mom is a volunteer and a member at the MBA so we went for free this weekend but I have previously been to the MBA and thoroughly enjoy coming back.The gift shop is DANGEROUS!!! Bring money or don't bother, they have SO much cute stuff from sweatshirts to dinner plates to jewelry and more. I love that place!Right there on Cannery Row, near the John Stamos museum! (lol)"
1870,2017-09-20,5,"Worth every penny! Especially if you been to some other aquariums, it's seams the ones by he ocean are the best. They were constantly cleaning the windows and had staff every where to show you things in the tank you wouldn't know."
1871,2015-05-30,5,Not cheap but it's a non-profit organisation and you can't put a price on kids happiness. They loved it. Great focus on interactive learning. Staff are friendly and helpful. Allow at least 3 hrs to enjoy the full experience.
1872,2014-08-18,5,"WOW. That's all that can really be said about this aquarium. Every exhibit is a must see, but the jellyfish experience is the cherry on top. If I had kids I would bring them here. Everything is curated very well and the installations are educational and appropriate, and the sense of ecotourism leaves you inspired. The 34 dollar ticket seems steep at first but upon entering I was soon relinquished of any buyers remorse. If you are in Monterey this is a must see!"
1873,2013-11-15,5,Fantastic aquarium! I mean really how much better can it get? The aquarium sits on the ocean with great views and nice outdoor space for enjoying those views. Really enjoyed how colorful the jellyfish exhibit was and of course I loved the penguins! We happened to be there to watch a feeding. I can't tell you the last time I enjoy watching someone else eat :-)Situated in a great area with lots to do within walking distance. Definitely a must see to add to your list!
1874,2012-05-13,5,Love this place.My favorite place to take my kids.  You can easily spend hours here walking around and enjoying the fish.
1875,2013-12-06,3,"I've been to this aquarium twice in my life. Once as a child with my parents and another time with my friends for a birthday. As a child, I loved it. I remember my mom bought me a coloring book from the gift shop. The worst part of that trip was the car ride from SF. Other than that, the trip was oodles of fun. As an adult, the aquarium was not as fun. To be honest, I enjoyed the drive down with my girls more than I enjoyed the aquarium. Don't get me wrong, it was interesting to see all the different aquatic creatures, and it was a nice day, but it wasn't FUN. To top it off, the tickets were a tad pricy (despite the student discount). I still recommend checking it out if you've never been though, especially if you have kids."
1876,2012-09-04,3,"I finally ended up at the aquarium over Labor Day weekend - I've been meaning to visit ever since my sister/parents went by themselves without me and they said it was a very nice experience! I didn't have much time to do any research on the aquarium, but my boyfriend found out that the wait for tickets can be crazy during weekends so he bought the tickets online the night before...was I SOOOOO glad he did!As soon as we arrived, we saw that the ticket line was RIDICULOUSLY long!!!!! Kudos for online tickets - we were able to bypass the entire line to enter the aquarium in just a few minutes (vs. 1-2 hour wait just to get tickets).Parking is also an issue here as the aquarium itself does not provide any parking whatsoever - the first indoor parking structure we went to right down the street actually ran out of space & were offering valet parking at the regular hourly parking rate ($24 until 6pm, I believe)...but we opted for the outdoor parking lot right across the street, which had plenty of parking left and only charged $20 all-day. There were also metered parking & other lots farther down, if you don't mind walking longer to get to the aquarium!The tickets were pricey, but I guess it's average when you compare to any other aquarium/local attractions elsewhere. At first, I thought the aquarium was not so big...but it took us a few hours to go around both ends of the aquarium (and both lower & upper floors). They had a variety of exhibits - the only marine mammal they have is the sea otter. Their main attraction that was the most interesting was probably the Jelly Experience (and the jelly fish exhibits). The Open Sea exhibit contains the largest single-pane window in the world, and they have touch pools with stingrays and other tide pool animals like star fishes and sea anemones.They have a lot more than just exhibits - they have scheduled animal feedings, featured presentations, and other activities for families. Unfortunately, we weren't able to make the timing for most of them but we saw part of the sea otter feeding from the monitors (since there were SO many people)!My biggest complaint is probably their cafe/restaurant. Everything is extremely over-priced, so it's literally impossible to have a budget meal unless you bring your own food from home! The food is not bad...but I'm not sure if I'm convinced that it's necessary to charge an arm and a leg for them.The aquarium also begins the Cannery Row, which houses a number of shops and restaurants, and makes it a fairly good touristy spot after you're done with the aquarium. You're also literally next to the water with some nice scenery for picture-taking.Overall, it was a nice experience and I can finally say that I've been to Monterey...I probably would have enjoyed it more if there were a lot less people/traffic!"
1877,2014-11-11,4,"Visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium for the first time in years, and definitely enjoyed my time here. It's a must see attraction if you are in the area, and it's really great seeing all the different research and studies they are working on in the Bay Area. It is also arguably the best aquarium in Northern California with the cutest sea otters! The special exhibit they had going on while I was there was an extra jellyfish display, which I had to say was magnificent. This place really gives you a nice appreciation for the ocean. My one criticism is the price. To charge an adult $49 for entry is a bit steep, but I guess that's the going rate these days. I would definitely like to come back here, but the frequency of my visits will probably be spaced out to be every other year."
1878,2015-04-02,5,Great educational experience if you take the time to read everything and speak with the volunteers. Met a nice volunteer lady who gave us all kinds of information on the skate. The jellie experience was so cute I loved it! They switch up their exhibits every 2 or 4 years so it won't always be the same.
1879,2017-11-10,1,"We had a horrible experience at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It is just not worth it! It is completely overpriced and incredibly crowded. If it were not overpriced and crowded I could deal with it. If it were very overpriced and not crowded I could deal with it, but crowded and expensive = a lot of very grumpy and entitled tourists! So that leads to my next point-the unbelievably rude tourists pushing to get closer to the tanks-really? I was yelled at for walking in front of pictures that I didn't even notice were being taken (just walking and keeping an eye on my children)and called an idiot. My kids were with me. No way will I be going back to this place. It is completely overrated. I also think they are completely missing the mark on their mission of education. Their prices make it undesirable, the crowds make it undesirable. There's no way they will get my money or time."
1880,2014-08-07,5,"You should come in Monterey just for visiting this wonderful acquarium. Jellyfish experience is amazing, penguins and otters are very funny. The guys working here are doing a good job"
1881,2007-11-07,5,"A place beyond your imagination, Monterey Bay Aquarium.  They are known for being the best aquarium in the WORLD!  The ocean is very dear to me, and this place just adds to my ocean obsession.Check out the exhibits to the breath taking views of the Monterey Bay.  My favorite exhibit is the sea otters!  They are soooo cute!  Awww!  Don't miss this California jem."
1882,2014-08-02,5,"Fantastic aquarium, the only problem is that it is incredibly crowded. Be prepared to wait a few minutes behind others to view a tank.The attention to detail at this place is incredible. Many of the descriptive signs have metal casts of sea creatures so kids can touch it and feel the texture. There are also plenty of exhibits at eye level, for both kids and adults. The lighting in the exhibits is beautiful which really enhances the beauty of the sea creatures. The place had a good mix of creative exhibits and simple exhibits which kept it interesting. Technology was also incorporated in some areas but it was never excessive or detracting from the animals."
1883,2016-10-06,3,"If you are visiting this aquarium, then yeah, 5 stars.  It's an amazing place.  They do good work.  They really try to inform the public of the grave threats our oceans are facing.  However, if you work there, I think they can do much better.  My son works there and was hired to work twice a week while he was in college.  During his first three weeks of classes (not in town, so he has to commute), he was scheduled for three days a week!  This, even after telling them many times that three days a week is too many.  No days to rest, no days to study.  Just school, school, commute,  work, work, commute, school, school...  Don't they have a conscience?  Shame on the scheduler and anyone else who is party to taking advantage of a bright young man."
1884,2017-11-06,5,"One of a kind. Great staff and volunteers. Great member extras like free entrance to Evenings by the Bay (music, no host bar and eats in the summer on weekends). One of the best deals if you come more than 2x a year is the membership. You cannot find this anywhere else in the world, seriously."
1885,2016-10-02,5,"Advice: Go early in AMOPENS AT 10 AM (yelp is wrong, not 9:30)Must-sees:- Feeding of otters at 10:30- Deep sea feeding at 11:00 (!)- Jellies"
1886,2016-10-02,5,I hope this review convinces you to visit. it is an  extraordinary exoerience. it's a spendy ticket but you'll see why once inside. We learned so much AND marveled at the beauty inside and out.
1887,2016-09-07,4,"We really enjoyed the aquarium. It was mostly focused on marine life found on the pacific coast. It didn't have the big ticket items like huge shark and whales, but it was much more education and interactive based exhibits than what I've seen in other aquariums. Definitely worth your time. I'd shoot for 3 hours. We really had to hoof it to do the whole place in 2."
1888,2016-06-16,5,"I've been a member at the Monterey Bay Aquarium for years. I can't express how beautiful this location is, and how great the staff, and the aquarium is. Love going there, and so does my family, we always have a blast. Also outside the aquarium are lots of places to dine, and stores to visit, many attractions, makes this locations one of my favorites. And you can't go there without visiting Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. They got the best dishes, and that is for another review."
1889,2014-01-29,5,"TL;DR:  One of if not the best aquarium I have ever been to.  Hands down.One of the best and most diverse collections of marine life anywhere.  They also perform important conversation and education programs, as well as research and husbandry that can be duplicated no where else. Sea otter rehabilitation.  Great White's kept alive and studied in captivity.  Seafood Watch programs.This place is truly a Shepard of the oceans.I can never get tired of walking through here and admiring all the diverse exhibits.  I've also become especially fond of their behind the scenes programs (book far in advance, they sell out fast).  Between the permanent exhibits and the rotating collections, there's always something amazing to see.This most recent time, it was the Mantis Shrimp, which is a seriously bad ass critter and deserves a Google, if you are unfamiliar.  The location of the Mantis Shrimp's exhibit was a little, shall we say, odd, but so few aquarium's actually keep them, you make do.Other notables include the Great White Shark, as mentioned before.  The Sea Horse exhibit (which has since moved on), The Jellyfish Experience (current), and of course, who could not spend a healthy amount of time watching those adorable little Otters.Go, immediately. You will not regret it."
1890,2015-11-22,5,"If you have never been here then you are missing out on life. I was so excited the rave squad was down to make a field trip day to drink and enjoy the aquarium. Of course the place was packed, so it was inevitable that we all got split up. Regardless of how old you are, there's always something in all of the exhibits that will catch your eye and tickle your fancy. My personal favorites included the Jellyfish Experience and touching the bat wing sting rays. It is also pretty dope that they have beer and wine that you can walk around drinking. Nothing beats learning and experiencing the mysteries of the sea while getting a good buzz going. Overall, if your looking for an epic aquarium trip then definitely make it a point to check this place out."
1891,2011-10-06,5,"Best. Aquarium. Ever. This place is amazing. I realize I'm just a big kid when I'm in a place like this. There is just so much to see. We had timed it just right and they were doing feedings in a few of the larger tanks. They have pretty much everything that you'd expect to see at an Aquarium as well as things you don't often see. That would be the otters, and the enormous Open Sea exhibit that has schools of tuna, mackerel, herring, and hammerhead and great white sharks. Easily the highlight of the experience for me. To see those fish fly around during their feeding and watching the shimmering cloud of herring was really cool. Find a good seat and turn off your flash. There are also a lot of outside areas that overlook the Monterey bay. If you look closely you may see some otters and seals amidst the kelp. I was also thrilled to see the efforts they are making for sustainable seafood. Seafood watch lists were passed out to anyone that wanted one, detailing the better seafood choices. They update these twice a year. You can download the free app too."
1892,2014-05-26,2,"Overrated & overpriced.  Sorry, try as I might to feel differently, I just can't. I admit that I did go to the Aquarium on the Sunday of a three-day weekend, and the place was jammed and very crowded and noisy. It was hard to get close enough to some of the windows and exhibits.  Moreover, many of the ""exhibits"" are simply watching fish swim by your window; interesting enough, but underwhelming.In conjunction with this, it should also be noted that traffic is horrendous in Monterey on a weekend, and the streets are mobbed with pedestrians, strollers, children, etc. Getting in and out, parking your vehicle, etc., can also be a major ordeal, one that should be factored into this experience as well.If you can get a break on the price ($39.00 per adult when I went) & go during a weekday when it is not crazy crowded, that might be a good deal. I was disappointed however in what I received."
1893,2013-10-08,1,"Ok. I would have given this place at least 4 stars but they really took advantage of my kindness and have truly pi**ed me off. I signed up for a year membership with a buddy of mine. Well...lets just say HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!!  This place sells your name to every nonprofit and then some. To make matters worse, they've made my last name my friends. Nothing against my friend but what an absolute sign of disrespect and poor handling of my information from the aquarium. To add more criticism, there's pure propaganda to show how humans are such a bad part of the planet. I can't entirely dispute that but come on...we're here to learn and enjoy and not get all the crap shoved in our faces.  As with most things, there should be a balance. As for the aquarium. Absolutely beautiful. Just go and pay for a day visit. Don't go and sign up for anything, unless you want all the junk mail garbage. Hey...aquarium...why don't you save a tree!  Don't sell our information!NEVER EVER SIGN UP FOR A MEMBERSHIP!!!   DON'T CONTRIBUTE MONEY...unless you're just wanting to get on a large mailing list and kill all those poor innocent trees."
1894,2016-04-11,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium has it all. Huge ocean displays with schools of fish darting around in deep water, Otters, Penguins, educational displays and exhibits, all kinds of sea creatures ranging from Jellyfish and Octopus to Nautilus and even a small marine aviary!We spent close to 5 hours at this amazing aquarium with more to see later. This is a huge albeit wonderfully maintained aquarium and definitely deserves the hype. I've been to pretty much all the major aquariums here in California including the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, Sea life at LEGOLAND, SeaWorld Aquarium and the Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institute in La Jolla. They're all wonderful and amazing places to visit specially if you've kids. What's astounding about MBA is the amount and variety of displays it carries. You definitely need an entire day, perhaps more to completely see this beautiful aquarium. One thing I'd like to mention is that it can be a bit challenging to find parking and to get to this aquarium. Plan your trip specially if you're not from Monterey area. Aquarium is surrounded by all kinds of interesting shops and walkways of Cannery Row. We drove close to 6 hours from Irvine, CA to get to Monterey but this place is definitely worth the road trip. It's truly a unique and wonderful experience to visit this aquarium in the beautiful city of Monterey."
1895,2016-10-26,5,"I love the Monterey Aquarium, in the summer we usually go to the local library and get free passes. The Jelly Fish Exhibit is beautiful and the feedings are awesome."
1896,2016-08-11,3,"Summary: Good, but not all it's cracked up to be. We have taken our son to several aquariums around the country and feel there are better values available. All of the standard exhibits but none of them really stood out. We felt the lighting in each exhibit didn't highlight the content at the same level as Long Beach or Atlanta aquariums. Additionally, the traffic flow through the facility seemed inefficient and use of space poor that led to a confusing layout with ""traffic jams"". Likely worth seeing if visiting the area with kids, but suggest setting expectations accordingly."
1897,2017-07-24,3,"Monterey Bay Aquarium has an incredible collection of animals, ranging from jellyfish, to sharks and stingrays, to huge tanks representing the open ocean, to penguins and sea otters. However, even though this is all amazing to see, I feel like the price is way too high. An adult is $50, Student with ID is $40, and Child under 12 is $30. I think that the experience is worth $30 at the most, since the place itself is really not that huge, and can be easily seen in right around hours. You could probably stay a while longer if you have kids though, because there are some areas that are geared more towards children. Try to come on an off time too, because on the weekends and holidays, its absolutely packed with families, and you can barely get to the glass to see the animals. For what it is with the price, I'd say its worth 3 stars. If the price is lowered, it could easily be 4 stars. There are also additional tours and experiences that you can add on for an additional charge."
1898,2014-09-07,5,Celebrated our Daughters 3rd bday here and the kids loved it! Was kinda upset that the larger tanks were a bit empty but that's ok! We loved seeing everything the Aquarium had to offer! Very clean and great staff who knew what they were speaking of! Great visual examples of how careless waste can lead to harming ocean life! Good for the kids to learn. Restrooms were clean. The restaurant should have a little more than the simple cafeteria food to offer to adults. Overall our experience was awesome and we will definitely return! :)
1899,2015-10-06,4,LOVE this aquarium. So much to see and even touch. Overall this is a true Monterey Bay gem. I have visited many times and each time is wonderful. Love the displays and loads of information provided. My favorite exhibit was the Sea Otters. I wanted to take one home! Absolutely adorable. I really wish their area was bigger though. Seems awfully small. Big drawback with the Otters is the amount of space to adequately view them especially during feeding times. The upstairs is ridiculous especially with a disabled child in tow. It made it impossible for the disabled (or abled) to see the otters. People visiting are so selfish to not make room for others and share the space. Pissed me off. Staff were not sensitive to the disabled and their needs. I was even told I have to move by a staff member. Very rude and insensitive. Others up there were also clearly annoyed. Also loved the display of all the jelly fish.....WOW! So cool. Another favorite was seeing the small display for Seahorses. They need to be showcased BIGGER!!!! It was a little small so I was a a tad disappointed. Overall worth the steep price for admission and the headache you'll get at the end of your visit trying to navigate the mass of people that go and don't like to share the space so others can see displays. That's the most annoying thing about here are the idiots who are rude and are selfish. Take some Excedrin with you. Oh and food area was pretty good as well. Big portions so you can easily share.....pricey though!
1900,2014-10-05,4,"Have always wanted to come here and I finally did. It wasn't as grandiose as I had expected. There were nice and captivating exhibits, but I would have liked to see more...I didn't see anything on dolphin...Overall, it was worth it, but I won't be returning soon because there really isn't anything that would lure you to return...unless you have kids. Souvenirs are overpriced here. You can get it at the local shops for a much more reasonable price."
1901,2014-05-09,5,A favorite of ours for many many years! It's pretty magical and very clean. Every employee we interacted with was courteous and informative. Prices are a little high but it's all for a great cause.
1902,2014-05-25,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is amazing! The open sea exhibit is incredible. I loved everything, especially petting the bat rays. I am fascinated with the ocean, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium does a brilliant job of displaying the underwater world for all ages. I would love to go back with my nephew, I think he would really enjoy it.The aquarium is huge, and it takes a while to go through, so if you have kids and are not planning on eating at the restaurant, make sure you bring snacks.They also seem to have a lot of interesting events. I saw on their website that Jack Johnson will be playing there this summer."
1903,2016-03-04,5,This place will open up your mind to a whole new world under water. It taught me to stop for a moment and B.R.E.A.T.H.E. !
1904,2017-07-21,5,Worth an annual visit! GREAT family destination and kids can be entertained for hours.
1905,2013-11-18,5,"The first thing we did when we arrived in Monterey was to visit the aquarium.  We didn't even bother checking into the hotel first.We have annual passes to the Long Beach aquarium, so we looked forward to comparing the two.It's a beautiful place and very spacious.  Of course we were there last week on a weekday and it's off season, so we were able to take our time and enjoyed each exhibit.The various jellyfish exhibits were fascinating to see and stood out the most for us.  The octopus and colorful moray eels exhibit were also pretty cool.We were hoping to see larger sharks since we were in Northern California, but they were similar in size to those we have at the Long Beach aquarium.Overall, a great visit for us!"
1906,2016-08-04,4,"We are a family of 5 who came to Monterey for 3 days. We were going to go to the aquarium for only one day but found that the membership price was a great value and we decided to do that. The staff was very accommodating to my daughter who was in a cast and offered, free of charge, a wheelchair to her all 3 days. The first night was Sunday and there was a special for members. We got to stay after they closed and there was music and a lot less people. The next day, Monday, was completely ""heavily attended"" and we had to fight our way through. The next day, we had a handle on it and it was more fun. The aquarium itself is just amazing. Also of note:  You can park in any parking spot with a meter if you have a handicap placard for as long as you need.  The two hours doesn't apply.  We used this feature a lot.  The streets around the aquarium are very chaotic."
1907,2014-06-23,3,"We were told Monterey Bay was the mecca of aquariums. I anticipated this being the highlight of the trip's attractions. Instead, we had a pleasant experience but nothing phenomenal. Entering was easy, since the place we were staying at had two member passes and I got a student discount, bringing the total for three to $25. The exhibits were of course fun, but not as huge and action packed as I had anticipated. Definitely catered to kids, with the same amount of interactive activities and murals as actual tanks. It was quite crowded, mostly families and their very loud spawn. Whenever you're in a tight space with the general public, its harder to really soak in the experience. As per usual, aquariums are perfectly wheelchair accessible but don't account for kids jumping in front of your view.Also, why were the exhibits so dark? I felt like I was tripping over people and could hardly read the map. I guess we're spoiled, since we just went to the Vancouver Aquarium and had a lovely time and hadn't been anywhere touristy the whole trip. If you can get some kind of discount, it's worth the visit, but I wouldn't say it's an absolute must see."
1908,2015-10-09,5,"I have been wanting to write a review for this place for a very long time. This aquarium is simply a marvel. At first I thought the ticket to enter seemed pricey but thanks to my husband we wanted to go here anyway. As soon as we entered we knew it was just worth it! The staff here are very genuine. Since we entered a little late they warned us that we might not be able to go around the entire place before closing time and suggested we come back the next day. But we were leaving town the same day so we bought the tickets and went in anyway. The scale at which this place operates is pretty fantastic. They have seasonal display and shows too which we were advised not to miss by the friendly staff. One can observe all kinds of fish from small to big. I never knew the beauty of aquatic life until I went here. We saw everything from tiny jelly fish to huge whales here. There's also a touch zone where you can touch some kinds of fish and feel them with your own hands. They strictly don't allow flash photography because it disturbs the fish but believe me, the photos without flash are so amazing, even better because of the colorful lights within the tanks. The staff here offered to take photos of us with the fish. They have shows at different times and you will have to spend at least half a day here to get to watch them. This is a must see place for kids. It is highly educative in here. Worth every penny!"
1909,2013-11-14,5,"This place is magical. I have been coming here ever since I can remember (25+ years) and throughout all these years still jump at any chance for a visit! The place is beautiful. Every new addition and exhibits only improve an already amazing aquarium. There is SO much to see, and you can rest assured you'll see it all in a safe, clean environment. My favorite exhibits are the Outer Bay (the jellies?! Amazing. Sunfish / sea turtles / hammerhead and occasional great white sharks?! Even more amazing to see.), the seahorses (living art, this exhibit ROCKS) and the original kelp forest. So many exhibits; otters, puffins, ocean health... The tanks and animals are just gorgeous. Tons of information is posted for learning, plus many volunteers to teach and answer questions.The interactive areas really add to the experience - there are several touch pools, volunteers aid in your seeing/feeling crabs, sea cucumbers, starfish, chitons and other goodies. There is also a sting ray pool, where you get to touch rays' backs if you're lucky enough for one to swim close. They also have a kiddie touch pool now, so cute to see kids interact with the creatures. They have events throughout the day, tank feedings and special animal expos, that are always worth attending to get a closer look and see something unique. I know they also offer behind the scenes tours that are amazing I'm sure.The kids area is fun! Our toddler daughter loves it. There are spaces to crawl, make art and learn about the animals and healthy ocean life in kid-friendly ways.I also love the gift shops! Unique stuffed animals and toys for the Littles, plus beautiful books and gifts for grownups. I'm a cheap skate and I still buy something every time. I'd pack your own food/drinks. There are places outside to see the bay and fuel up.If you can afford a membership there, it is SO worth it. This aquarium is a ""must see"" in California."
1910,2013-09-11,4,"I'm not usually a fan of crowded place where there are tons of people lining up just to get inside, but I'd come here twice and both times I loved it. Their collection of jelly fish along with the seahorses always amazed me and gotta love their penguins too, they're such a crowd-attention seeker.Aquarium of the Pacific in LA has nothing compared to this. The location was so perfect at the bay at the end corner of Cannery Row. 1 deducted one star because I wish there are more sharks in the aquarium, but I'm still pretty happy with my visit here. Students or recent graduates, bring your college ID so you can get a lil discount for the entrance fee."
1911,2013-08-07,5,"100th review!The Monterey Bay Aquarium does an outstanding job of recreating ecological habitats for endemic aquatic species around Monterey Bay and giving the public stellar information on marine biology and ecology.Jellies, octopi, penguins, kelp forests, sea otters, sea horses, sharks, and much more awesome creatures to see at the aquarium! One of the most exciting things to see here is feeding time, especially in the million-gallon tank!"
1912,2015-01-04,5,Love it. The last time that I was here was probably 19 years ago. I just love how beautiful the ocean creatures are.
1913,2014-10-25,5,"It had been a long time since I had been to the Monterey Aquarium, and it was just as great as the last time... and actually just as great as when I was a kid. We had free passes that came with our vacation house, so we were already happy... especially when we saw the admission price now! We decided to go late in the day on a weekday, and it was a big payoff... the place was wide open to us, no lines, no kids everywhere, and no tour groups.We hit all the favorites first... the penguins, jelly fish, and etc., but I have to say our favorite exhibit was the special over-fished marine life tank... it was awesome, two stories of sharks, tuna, turtles, and other amazing creatures. All in all, it was a great visit and the Monterey Bay Aquarium is still a top-notch attraction for all!"
1914,2011-12-20,5,"I don't even really like marine life and I loved this place. If you are going to go to one aquarium, THIS IS IT. It's one of the best in the nation and I went when they had the baby shark exhibit (which is rare). There was a great show of the ginormous tank where they fed all the fish and it's just breathtaking to see even all the little silvery sardines swimming in a whirlpool of shimmer. There is the friendliest staff there and this place is organized so well... very spread out so there isn't crowds of people you are stuck behind. I imagined it bigger but it was so great to see penguins being fed, puffins swimming around, and the gorgeous, purple jellyfish against bright blue water. You can get your hand stamped so you can leave to eat at any of the charming seafood eateries in the cute downtown area (feels like a smaller version of SFO!)Best date place ever!"
1915,2014-06-17,4,"If you're in Monterey -- Go.My wife and I are in Monterey for our honeymoon and this was one of our first stops. We spent nearly four hours here and had a great time. Make sure to get to any of the feedings about 15 minutes early to get a good spot. (The Open Sea feeding was my favorite.)I'm not sure if there are days that are slower than normal, but if so...try and go then. My only complaint (and it's got nothing to do with the aquarium itself), is I felt like by the end of the day we were dodging children running around like we were in Disneyland. (For reference, we went from 10-1:30ish)"
1916,2014-07-08,4,"It is fun to go here with a group of people and watch the ocean life and participate in different activities. They had this scuba thing where kids learned to scuba, see and touch the sea critters, but it was KIDS ONLY. It was free so if I had the power to turn into a kid I would totally do it... I have a suggestion for the room with the sharks and turtle, make it where you can see better in the dark. One thing I really didn't like was how crowded everything was.  If only it was less crowded... I didn't get to see the sea otters get fed :("
1917,2012-01-05,5,"My husband and I stayed and the Monterey Hotel Plaza and Spa on New Year's Eve.  The bell hop at the hotel was kind enough to tell us if we purchased aquarium tickets via the hotel we could get two consecutive days for the price of one!  Awesome!  Even better was the gorgeous walk to the aquarium from the hotel (about 15 minutes).  Since it was NYE and a Saturday, the aquarium was a bit crowded but that was expected.  I've been going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium since I was a little kid so I was overjoyed to finally be able to take my little one.  Granted my son is only 11 months, but he was mesmerized watching the fish, sharks, jelly fish and sea horses. Most of the tanks are large and leave enough viewing room for lots of people.  My favorite exhibit is the jellyfish.  Once he gets a little older, I'm sure my son's favorite will be the touch pools :-)  My husband and I are hoping to make this a NYE tradition and I can't wait to go back."
1918,2014-12-27,5,"fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish,,,,, fish!!!!! I've seen so many fish today! Every one knows how amazing it is already so I'd like to share some useful tips on getting there. If you came from out of town, it really works out if you get a hotel nearby within walking distance. If with free parking, even better!!! You can avoid crazy traffic around that area because I do believe fighting for parking and dealing with crazy traffic would kill the fun. Also, BUY TICKETS AHEAD OF TIME ONLINE FOLKS!!!! When we got there this morning around 10:30am, we saw LARGE lines around building outside and we were freaking out!!! I thought the aquarium got so full that they made people wait outside, like what nightclubs do to control traffic. ..... Turned out that's the line for buying tickets!!!! Damn! I never felt so great with printed tickets in hand, skipped large lines, waved at people waiting in line with a smile and got into the aquarium like a champion as soon as we arrived! B-) This place is more like for kids. It could get quite scientific. As two adults, it was really fascinating to watch those beautiful fishes and marine life. My favorite parts were the ocean's edge and the open sea. Jellies were really interesting to check out! The shows in auditorium are too scientific. The feeding programs were interesting for the first 10 minutes then it got boring.....  Be prepared for people who operated large cameras like machine guns and took pictures for EVERY. SINGLE. FISH in the tank.... The observation deck has gorgeous view of the bay and it added some romantic elements for couples. ;) This place is perfect for every one and serves all purposes!!!"
1919,2016-03-04,5,"Visit the jellyfish exhibit, Finding Nemo display, and touch the sting ray! This is one of the best aquariums I have ever been to. Its peaceful environment is perfect for a relaxing afternoon or a great place to study at.I'd recommend going on a weekday to avoid the extreme crowdedness of weekends. You can go at your own pace, read every sign, and see every exhibit!"
1920,2013-09-06,5,"Read for parking tips.All of the parking 4-5 blocks away have either 60 or 90 minutes. If you want free parking anytime of the day for any duration, the closest street I found is on the block of 675 Laine Street, Monterey, CA. I parked there for bike riding and was gone the whole day. It's 0.4 miles away but worth the $10-15 that you save."
1921,2016-06-08,5,"Friendly staff and an enormous amount of aquarium displays. The staff is very friendly and helpful, a lot of things to do for kids to keep them entertained. If you are a tourist, I would definitely recommend coming here."
1922,2016-10-12,4,"My only complaint is how busy this place gets. I know that is a good thing for the aquarium and I am being selfish but it is hard to walk around when people without any sense of manners are running into you.Rant over. The fish are amazing. I love the open sea room where you can see all the Tuna and Sharks and what not. I wasn't able to get to the sea otters yet but I am not worried as I became a member so I can visit whenever I like due to the crowds. Way better deal than a single visit and it helps out the aquarium. I wasn't able to check out the cafeteria but this place is a one stop shop with food, exhibits, and an auditorium showing different videos on the ocean."
1923,2016-10-10,1,"""Outrageously Expensive and too far to drive from San Francisco""So yes, the aquarium has some nice displays, a variety of fish, and activities for small kids (4-10) but is it really worth a 2 hour drive from the Bay Area/San Francisco/East Bay and then pay $50 per adult? - Absolutely not. Oh, and add to that $15 for Parking too.Instead, visit San Francisco's Golden Gate Park Natural History / California Academy of Sciences + Planetarium / Botanical Garden / Conservatory of Flowers for a much better and far less expensive experience."
1924,2017-03-25,2,We paid a lot of money to sleep over night with our giant adventure guides group. The attendants were very rude and aggressive talking about wider walkways when there was plenty of room. Also about half of the aquarium was closed so we couldn't see it. Many of us have discussed this and will not be returning. We will also be sharing the details of the beautiful aquarium run like a police state with our friends and family. They seem to have forgotten the fact that we pay their salaries.
1925,2012-07-31,5,"I've visited numerous aquariums across the country is this one stands alone at the top!  The best part--how interactive and hands on this aquarium is for kids! The shows entertaining, the feedings are so much fun, the exhibits are colorful, clean and beautiful, the staff are knowledgeable and love educational moments, and the integration of the pacific coastline with the aquarium is the icing on the cake.  LOVE THIS AQUARIUM!  If we lived in the area, we'd definitely be members. Tips:*Go early, so you have at least an hour before it's crazy packed, especially if you go on the weekend*If you have little kids, bring the stroller, there's ample stroller parking before each exhibit if the little ones want to walk through*Take advantage of the hands on activities*Aim for a weekday, the weekends are super crowded*Make sure you save a few minutes for the gift shop...it's pricey but there are some fun souvenirs.  *Visit every exhibit, you will NOT be disappointed*Get your hand stamped so you can return!*HAVE FUN & ENJOY!!!!!!!!"
1926,2017-10-10,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great place for adults and children.  Educational, engaging, eco friendly.  Sea life up close.  Amazing! Exceptional!  New play area for kids is a hit!"
1927,2013-09-03,3,"3 stars? Did she really give it 3 stars? Noooo.... Yessss...YESSSS I did, I gave it 3 stars.  A year ago I would have given this place 5 stars...but...not...any...more...When we got there, there was this huge queue. It would have taken us at least 30 minutes if we just stood there but there was this lady who told us we could skip the queue if we got an (expensive) membership. We had a screaming 1 year old, of course we went with the membership. We spent a small fortune (more than a hundred dollars :-/ ) and skipped the queue. I was expecting the awesome fish, jelly and seahorse tanks and yes the fish tanks were still great but boy did they screw up the jelly and seahorse tanks. They used to be so cool (and there were a lot more), so quiet, so peaceful but not anymore! Just a few tanks, obnoxious 60's music and some weird lights that didn't work at all with the pretty jellyfish floating around in the tanks.And the same crapy format was used for the seahorses. Seriously aquarium people...what the hell? I come here for peaceful tranquil fish watching, not for some weird show :(The restaurant is ok, they got some nice pastry but it is all pretty expensive. And if you already spent so much on getting there it really sucks to spend more money on just a coffee. Will I come back? Of course I will but amI bummed about the stupid changes that were made? Heck yeah!!"
1928,2016-06-21,5,"Just purchased membership again and I'm glad that we did. My family and I love marine life and learning about conservation, Monterey Bay Aquarium offers family friendly and informative tours. Great place to get lost!"
1929,2015-10-19,4,Always fun to come here with my family. It's not quite as big as it's made out to be but for a 3 year old there's plenty to do and see. Beats the overpriced excuse of an aquarium we have here in SF. Worth the trip at least once a year. The gift shops have something for all ages too.
1930,2014-12-18,5,Our children absolutely loved this place. We were here last time about three years ago and they have added so much more. The staff and volunteers were also so amazing. Our son is so into sea. Life and had a blast at every specimen learning something new. Check out the Jelly Experience!!!
1931,2016-03-26,1,"I am really shocked to see 4.5 star for this place. It doesnt deserve it at all.First of all, $40 is ticket which is way too expensive for this place and very less exhibits and we hardly get to touch the exhibits.I have been to Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach and Monterey is nowhere comparison to that.This is Exclusively for kids. too crowded.Only good thing is sea otters. definitely not for adults.The 3D movie they show starts well but ends abruptly.I would say this place isn't worth the money.If the entrance fee and parking were of a better price then I would probably suggest one visit is good."
1932,2016-10-05,5,"This place was super fun! I have to say I learned more about sea life at this aquarium than at school. I was intrigued by all the jellyfish. All in all, I had a great time at this aquarium. It is a great place to learn, visualize, and experience the ocean life."
1933,2013-09-22,5,"By far the best aquarium I've ever gone to - this place puts places such as Aquarium by the Bay and the California Academy of Sciences to shame.Your best bet is try to arrive at this place by 11:00 am to witness the deep sea feeding, which I hear is the best feeding experience in the entire aquarium but an experience that I've now missed in the two times I've been here.There's an area where you can touch things such as starfish and sea cucumbers, an area that has information on the MBARI project that the aquarium's researchers take part in to learn more on how to preserve aquatic life, an area upstairs for kids to play in, and multiple feeding schedules during the day.As a science guy myself, this place makes me think twice on if I really chose the correct career path (should I have been involved in marine biology?). The best part was the open ocean area that has all sorts of jellyfish, turtles, and hammerhead sharks. The view is soooo clear I felt as if I was witnessing these living organisms on an LED screen!This is a perfect place to explore nature, breathe in fresh air, and enjoy a moment with your loved ones. The fact that this is located in cannery row is icing on the cake in that there are so many restaurants to choose from (I've eaten at Johnny Rockets and Fish Hopper).As far as parking is concerned, if you plan on staying here a long time, the 4 floor parking garage in between Wave and Foam streets is your best bet because it's $10 for the entire day."
1934,2014-01-02,5,"Four years ago, a coworker told me that his favorite place in the world was the Monterey Bay Aquarium. He said that he couldn't explain why it was his favorite place and today, I understand what he meant. There are really no words that can fully explain the immense beauty of this aquarium and how they marry a tourist attraction to the endless immensity of the sea. I came on a Saturday, around 10am. Be prepared to wait. It took about 25 minutes for me to actually get into the aquarium. Saying that there was a lot of people would be an understatement. It was crowded. Very crowded.But the crowd did not distract me from the love of the sea. I asked an employee what her favorite place in the aquarium was and she said the Deep Open Sea (or something like that). I went to that exhibit and the first thing I see are thousands of fish swimming rapidly in a curricular direction with a sign that says, ""the sea is as near as we come to another world."" Then, I took a couple more steps into the exhibit and saw jelly fish. Beautiful, exquisite jelly fish. I could gaze at them forever. At the end, there was an open sea tank of all sorts of creatures from the water... but, I'd have to say, I was more intrigued by the little tentacles from my jelly friends.My favorite place was the kelp forest tank. I literally sat there for 30 minutes, just in awe of what was before me. I could go on and on about the entire aquarium and the other surprises along the way, but I don't want to rob your experience for when you go. This is definitely a must see location when you're in the area and if I lived up here, I would totally get the student year pass. It's only $50, whereas general admission is $32.95 for adults. I hope I can make it back again, some day."
1935,2014-04-18,5,"Wow........ the Aquarium was beautiful the people in Monterey, CA are so nice my trip was for the IBD Bike Summit. If you are looking for a place to relax bike ride, and enjoy life with a bottle of Wine this is the place Love IT I'm 100% going back."
1936,2013-07-22,5,"What: - Aquarium next to the Monterey Bay - Auditorium Programs on sealife - Animal feeding programs - Family shows - Tours and Adventures More Info: - Entrance fee is $34.95/adult, with discounted prices for students and senior members; credit cards accepted. Check out the current prices online secure4.gatewayticketing… - When tickets are purchased online, they are valid for a one-time entry within one year from the date of purchase - Parking is in the garages nearby (Canner Row Garage) is just a couple of blocks from the aquarium; fee is $15/day - Plan to spend at least 3 hours inside the aquarium - Paid parking is also available on the streets - Restrooms available near the ticket counter and inside the aquarium - Cafes and gift shops available inside the aquarium This was my second time visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the first time with a friend and the second time with my parents and in-laws. I certainly wouldn't mind making a third visit to bring my family and friends here because this place is just fascinating. Tickets can be purchased in person or online or via phone; during both my visits I got them in person and the lines weren't too long. At the entrance they hand over a map of the aquarium with the timings of special programs for the day. The special programs include Auditorium Programs, Feeding Programs, Family Shows, Tours & Adventures. The placards displays at every exhibit are neat and informative. It is fun to look at the placards and search for the specific fish inside the exhibit. Some of the fish are so small that magnifying glasses are placed near the exhibits to help visitors find them. A few others are camouflaged among the plants, rocks or corals inside the exhibit. My favorite exhibits are: Kelp Forest:With a height of 28 feet, apparently, it is one of the tallest exhibits in the world! The Kelp Forest hosts a number of animals from the small Pacific sardines to the mighty leopard sharks. Watching the bat fish slide on the bottom surface of the tank and veering off the sand is a sight to behold. As the fishes swim close to the visitors, I couldn't help but wonder what they must be thinking while seeing the crowd of humans around them. Octopus:As we entered the Octopus arena, our eyes caught the sight of a humungous octopus! One of the aquarists was holdings its arms to feed it. The way the octopus expands and contracts its arms to swim draws one's attention.Touch Pools:This is my favorite part every time I visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium. This is where you get the opportunity to touch amicable bat rays, sea stars, crabs, etc. Volunteers are always standing next to the touch pools to guide you and educate you about their dwelling habits. During my recent visit, the volunteer flipped a sea star and showed its stomach and how it normally consumes food through its stomach. The fascinating thing was at that point of time, the sea star was in the process of eating a tiny shrimp! Paper napkins and hand sanitizers are placed next to the touch pools. Sea Otters:For some reason, I just love the way the sea otters look, rest on their backs with their bellies up, roll in the waters and eat the food from their pouches. I have seen them in the wild in several places and was excited about taking a closer look at these mammals in the aquarium. Pacific Sardines:Just at the entrance to the Jellies section, a circular structure lit in deep blue offers a mind-blowing view of schools of Pacific sardines synchronously swimming in the same direction. No wonder the phrase ""packed like sardines"" makes sense. Jellies:This is perhaps a favorite for most people who visit the Monterey Aquarium. The translucent jellies could be clearly seen through the attractively lit water tanks. The aquarium hosts several kinds of jellies and a few of those look really captivating. Puffins:The way the puffins dive up to the water surface looks clumsy Seahorses:We were not even aware that so many species of seahorses even exist until we came here. The leafy sea dragons are camouflaged amongst the plants. The dragon pipefish looks like miniatures of snakes. Check out the potbelly seahorses with huge paunches. And the Pacific seahorses that are found only in the California coast. The dwarf seahorses had their tails amazingly tangled around the plants. Tips: - Check out the harbor seals and sea otters from the free telescopes in the Viewing Stations at one end of the aquarium - Parking on the streets is cheaper than parking in the Cannery Row Garage - The food inside the café is expensive with limited and expensive options - Use the map (the one they give at the entrance) as a guide to check the timings of the different programs and plan accordingly"
1937,2011-09-21,5,"OMG I love this place! I've been here a total of 4 times and loved the visits. I will never grow tired of this place. Tickets are a bit pricey but it's all for a good cause, keeping this place up and running. Try coming on a weekday when it's not so busy. Sometimes the line to get in can be super long. Get here early and park in the parking structure. So much to do and so little time! My favorite exhibits are the jellyfish and seahorse. Amazing~ I just like to watch them float around and taking pictures. Make sure to turn off flash. Great place to take a date!! Wink wink."
1938,2014-03-24,5,I had so much fun when I came here! Visited in January with my boyfriend for our 1 year trip and we had a blast! Unfortunately we had to zoom through the last 30 or so minutes because they were closing but the staff there were so knowledgeable. I got a student discount when getting my ticket (bought mine online just show them your student ID when you arrive). I hadn't been here in YEARS so the only exhibit I remembered was the otters exhibit. Definitely a great experience and will be back :)
1939,2014-03-24,5,"My boyfriend brought me here today for my first visit to the aquarium & I can honestly say it was worth the price! This aquarium is world renowned and anyone can see why. As a visitor you can touch starfish, crabs, and even  bat reys! I felt like a small child wanting to learn and see everything that was around me. The staff was very friendly and helpful at explaining the different types of fish, anemone's, and other sea life creatures. I can't wait to come again!"
1940,2015-04-27,5,"Beautiful aquarium with lots to see. We went first thing in the morning and arrived ten minutes before opening to an incredibly long line of people waiting to buy tickets. If you pull out your smartphone, you can quickly buy a ticket online which will let you skip the whole line and enter the aquarium. We moved through the exhibits at a pretty fast pace, stopping for three feedings, and completed our visit in about an hour and a half - but it would be easy to spend much longer there. Feeding tip: the morning feeding of the sea otters and penguins happens at the same time, creating a somewhat difficult choice. We found the sea otter viewing much more crowded and difficult to see unless you showed up early, so we stuck around for the first few minutes of the sea otter feeding and then headed over to the Penguins to catch the end of their feeding which still had plenty of viewing room."
1941,2016-06-26,5,Always love this place. Really nothing more to say but get there and enjoy everything to offer.We always buy season passes as the prices are close to a day pass.
1942,2016-09-28,5,"A truly remarkable scientific aquarium! I was impreseed at how many participatory activities were available for very small children, even two or three years old. There was plenty to fascinate the adults, also, in a truly beautiful, and well-planned environment. Absolutely first-rate!"
1943,2014-10-21,5,"As a Monterey local, I can honestly say this place never gets old. I always learn something new and being a nature lover, I am always fascinated by the sea life!This aquarium pretty much sh*ts on the aquarium in SF so if you're on the fence about which one to go to, choose Monterey Bay Aquarium. Great for kids, maybe even better for adults (did someone say psychedelic jellyfish?)"
1944,2017-09-27,5,Simply one of the very best in the world. Do not miss it if you visit Monterey!
1945,2017-09-27,2,"More exhibits for kids than adults. Not even a shark! Appreciate the conservatory approach, but not worth the money for us today."
1946,2011-06-23,5,"Two words: sea horses!After a trip to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago several years ago, I've been fascination with these little creatures of the ocean. You have no idea how delighted I was to find out that the Monterey Bay Aquarium has an entire exhibit dedicated to sea horses. The aquarium itself is beautiful, built right into the Bay. They have a nice view of the water and incorporate a lot of the natural habitat into exhibits. It was a beautiful California day when I visited, so we were able to sit outside for a bit and soak in the rays while watching the waves crash onto the rocks. Of course we did all this before hitting up the sea horses. Gotta save the best for last. And the exhibit did not disappoint! Not only did I get to see at least 4-5 different species, but I also got to see teeny, tiny baby sea horses as well. Some other interesting facts: males give birth (awesome), sea horses are prone to mating around sunset (obviously they've got a sense of romance) and there are several different species found all over the world. My favorite part about sea horses? When they lock tails and float together... The rest of the aquarium is a blur, but from what I recall it was very nice and appropriate for all ages. Definitely a hot spot in Monterey for tourists. But I'm sure that locals come here every now and then to check out the latest exhibits and remind themselves why their neck of the woods is so unique."
1947,2016-09-26,4,Have been to the aquarium a few times and it has been enjoyable every time.. It was really crowded during the first visit so have tried to go off peak every time after that. Fun for all ages!
1948,2016-06-07,5,Amazing place to get lost in the beauty of the ocean and learn things along the way while having lots of fun. The jellyfish exhibit transports you to another world. Many wonderful decks to sit and look out into the bay.
1949,2016-01-21,5,Super great aquarium to take kids to though its extremely crouded on holiday weekends.  The resrtaraunts are very pricy but across the street is a brewery.  The only issue is that after looking at all those fishies one finds themself starving for fish of any kind.  There is a sushi place on light house thats pretty good
1950,2013-04-18,5,"A highlight of this region!  The 'Jellies' and 'Seahorse' displays are a lifetime event that needs be seen if at all possible. This is not an avg aquarium with glass windows and reef fish. This is a major league aquarium !The sea otters are so lovable, ul want to take one home!"
1951,2014-08-07,5,"It was 4th of July and crazy. I don't like crowds, but I came away loving it.Highlights:-high school age volunteers greeted us with cool stuffed animals that they taught us about-text alerts for unscheduled feedings-the aviary with amazing birds and some fish-the tentacles exhibit was off the hook! so amazing. definitely worth it-the staff was super nice and friendly-the video about Luna the otter-the real otters!-the gift shop had some nice stuff!Definitely a must see museum for anyone in NorCal."
1952,2014-03-03,5,Very Beautiful aquarium. My only advice would be to come in the afternoon to avoid it being over crowded. Opening is like rush hour and it will be hard to see everything.
1953,2012-05-25,5,"I can never get enough of the aquarium! I'm for sure becoming a ""member"" as soon as I have kids! Every exhibit is informative, the workers are amazing and knowledgable, and the animals are always awesome! When I arrive, I go straight to the Open Ocean exhibit. It's the BEST aquarium in California! Don't waste your time at the Long Beach Aquarium!"
1954,2014-04-18,5,"Awesome place to visit and to take the family.  Its one of the best and largest aquarium in West Coast.  This place exhibits and captures oceans life diversity and let you experience and connect with. I love all the exhibits from Tuna, Sunfish, Octopus to colorful anemones and bright jelly fishes. Fantastic place to visit when in Monterey."
1955,2014-02-23,4,Nice large aquarium. Defiantly worth a trip to Monterey any day. Great exhibits! The sea otters and the big tank with the turtle are my favorites.  :)
1956,2012-08-01,5,"Very nice and HUGE aquarium. Got lost a few times on our stroll around the exhibits. The place gets really crowded all throughout the day, and has a line even before it opens, but I have to say is very worth the time and money. Even though its jam-packed, if you just follow the flow, you can get a chance to see most of the exhibits up close and have plenty of time to take pictures and see the special shows.I learned a lot about aquatic life going to the aquarium and saw a lot of spectacular things, didn't do the touch pool though, the fish scared me!Everyone should come here!"
1957,2017-07-25,5,"Probably the best aquarium I've ever been to.  Terrific exhibits, helpful staff everywhere.  They can't do enough to make your visit memorable.  Got the two-day senior and child tickets at our hotel -- an excellent value for an educatioation, hands-on experience that rivals going to a theme park at bargain rates.  Free shuttle to and from the aquarium from a block away from our hotel made the visits easy.  A terrific aquarium!!!  If I lived anywhere relatively nearby in CA, I'd be a member."
1958,2016-01-02,5,"Yes it's pricey but worth the cost and as good as everyone says. If you're staying at a nearby hotel, you can get a 2 day pass for the price of 1 day. Otherwise you can save just a few bucks at the local AAA office. If you want to get away from the fray for a bit, reserve a table for lunch at Cindy's Waterfront and ask for a window table. You can also rest in the auditorium with thirty minute segments. Plenty of parking lots and garages within walking distance. If you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary, you can get a free pin at the info center."
1959,2017-07-04,5,"Plan on spending the day.  This is ""a 5 star aquarium in many ways;"" so I'm giving it five stars.  I recognize that the research and programs the aquarium does cost money, big money; so I do not begrudge the high cost to enter the other world experience of the ocean.  My favorites are the Medusas (the jellies) and the big tanks.  Although I've been going to the aquarium for over 40 years, each time I return, there's always something new to witness.  It never gets old.  I appreciate each time I go into a seafood restaurant and find the sustainable seafood list from the aquarium posted on the restaurant tables.  This is one of the best aquariums in the world, and I've been to many in the States and overseas.  It's worth five stars and I give it five stars."
1960,2014-07-27,4,"We have been here plenty of times, having kids and living in the Bay Area. I will say it would be a lot less if we had to pay each time for tickets. They are quite expensive so we are lucky to use guest passes since my parents are members. The aquarium is very very busy on the weekends and its tough to maneuver through the exhibits so it is best to go during the week if you can swing it. Also we always get a stamp to return and leave for lunch as the food is overpriced and the lines to get a table can be long. I do agree with past Yelpers that it is geared towards kids and that works out well for us but I don't know how much I would go if it was just my husband and myself.Yes there are two jellyfish areas however the new tentacles exhibit is fantastic and the open ocean room has lots of sharks and other interesting fish. The gift shops are amazing. Too good actually. All in all, a great place to visit during the week."
1961,2014-10-01,5,"This place is huge! Lots of fish and marine critters everywhere. They have scheduled feeding times for certain critters (we checked out the penguin feeding), so be sure to check those out. The open sea exhibit was probably my favorite. You get to see all sorts of creatures swimming about, including a giant school of tuna fish and a chill lookin' sun fish. They also had this super super groovy and psychedelic jellyfish exhibit. The parking might be hard to find, but there is a some what pricey parking lot nearby. The surrounding area is also really nice with plenty of restaurants, so you can walk around after your aquarium adventuring and grab a bite to eat."
1962,2016-10-11,4,"Had a good time with the family here.. grandson was ecstatic. Overall it was worth the visit. The prices are kind of steep, but I understand that it is self funded. We were able to save quite a bit by going to AAA and getting our tickets, $35 dollars vs $50 made it much more enjoyable."
1963,2013-08-10,5,"This place has it all! From tiny little sea creatures you never new existed, to giant sea turtles sharing a massive tank with hammer head sharks. Everything is on display right in front of you making for an amazing experience. The jellyfish had to be one of my favorite exhibits along with the sea otters who were full of energy and playing with one another. This place is a must go. It's great for families, dates, or friends. The only downside was how crowded it was but it's like that for great reasons."
1964,2016-06-14,5,I have been to aquariums all over the country and this is by far the best aquarium across the land. It is a fun experience across the board and you can walk out on the deck outside for some incredible views. Definitely worth the stop if you are driving through.
1965,2014-10-31,5,"Went with my mother and my sister in the afternoon (around 3pm) on a weekday and were pleased to see the otters and everything else the aquarium has to show (jellyfish, touch stations, penguins, gift shop, etc.) despite the high-priced admission tickets ($40 adult). We thought it was the perfect time to go because there was no line, not crowded, and we saw the otters play. We were also able to see a scuba diver do a session from inside the kelp forest tank--neat! I was SUPER impressed with the staff and especially the volunteers! They were friendly, knowledgeable and very willing to help and teach. Since I'm going to be a resident for a few months, I bought a membership ($75 individual) and they were able to subtract the $40 admission price. So an extra $35 to go back whenever I want--deal."
1966,2014-02-15,5,"For anyone who doesn't know, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is world class. Anyone visiting the Monterey Bay area should definitely think about visiting this aquarium. Local residents should also make a point to visit it, especially on the days where Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Benito county residents (ID required) can get in for free. Yes, expect it to be totally packed to the gills with tons of kids and strollers parked along the walls, but it's still really worth it.The exhibits are amazing and bring the beautiful underwater world up close and personal. There are touch pools where you can touch and learn about bat rays and sea stars. You can watch workers feed the puffins, sea otters, and penguins at various times during the day. The jellyfish exhibit was really amazing, with jellies in all colors and sizes. The giant kelp forest tank is mesmerizing and you can sit and watch the fish and creatures for a really long time. One thing I noticed was that there was really relaxing music playing throughout the aquarium, especially by the kelp forest tank. I went to both of the gift shops and asked if there was a CD of the music being played, and was told by two very nice, helpful cashiers that indeed there was a CD of Music of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I asked one cashier if it had been a busy day and she started telling me about the financial status (""based on stats from last year because this year's aren't out"") how much the gift shop makes and contributes to the running of the aquarium. It was nice that she knew about that and was happy to share. She inquired about what I liked most about the aquarium. I found both cashiers I interacted with to be very friendly and helpful. I did buy the CD and I love it. Besides being able to see what's under the surface of the ocean, one of the best things about the aquarium is its focus on educating the public about the importance of conservation and protecting our ocean waters. If they reach just one person who doesn't throw a cigarette butt on the ground, avoids using single-use plastic grocery bags, or now understands the negative impact of having the ocean temperature change even a few degrees, it will be worth it. A visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great experience for adults and children to see what's in the water, just steps from the aquarium."
1967,2014-07-19,5,Great place to visit. Prepare to wait in line to buy tickets. AAA sells them as well. Parking is &15.
1968,2016-08-13,5,"Best in the world or close to it. Just listen to all the foreigners who visit this awesome city and aquarium. Worth the money, it's a lot. Buy at hotel to save $"
1969,2011-05-23,3,"Let me start off saying this: I AM NOT A HARD PERSON TO PLEASE. I can have fun no matter what I am doing or where I am at... that being said I really hate having to give this review 3 stars... You might be asking... HOW IN THE WORLD COULD SHE ONLY GIVE THIS AQUARIUM 3 STARS???? Maybe my hopes were too high & was expecting it to be the Disneyland of all Aquariums. The fact that this place is world famous made me expect so much more. All I know is... most exhibits were closed for renovations, I love jelly fish & there was only a small tank of jelly fish open & barely any sharks & no dolphins like everyone told me. The seahorses & sea otters were very cool to look at but I was just expecting a lot more fish & exhibits & not so much activist education, a little bit is fine but every where we went??... it was a little much. When we were in the section were you can touch the sting rays (which I love too) there were so many 'ADULTS' pushing & shoving we just said forget it... the adults were acting more like children than their own children!! Oh & just a little side note for all the 'adults'... WHEN A SIGN CLEARLY STATES NOT TO USE YOUR FLASH WHILE TAKING PICTURES.. do you think you can follow clear instructions? Just asking... because THERE IS ACTUALLY A REASON WHY THEY PUT THAT SIGN THERE. I'm actually giving this review an extra star for Whole Foods sponsoring a celebrity chef cooking event with a kids fun festival type thing while we were there that my daughter absolutely loved. She made a fun chef hat, frosted her own cookie all fun & festive, she had her face painted... plus, there was lots of free foods to sample for kids & adults it was huge, free & she loved it. I really felt that both the aquarium of the pacific in Long Beach & the aquarium in San Francisco were in some ways a lot better than Monterey based on what we saw. I actually left a little disappointed & second guessing myself thinking maybe its just me but when I heard another group saying the same thing as I was thinking... I didn't feel so bad. $30.00 a person with half of the exhibits open is a little much in my opinion. But maybe we just need to go back on a day when all the exhibits are open."
1970,2011-12-17,5,"Ive been here a few times throughout my life. Always love coming here. I had a few questions and asked a younger lady in a gift shop, named Audrey who was very helpful. The exhibits were awesome. Too bad we went on a busy day. The Puffins and Penguins were my favorite. I also like the hands on areas. The sting-rays swam far away from the public, but it was cool touching the starfish. I hope to come back soon!"
1971,2014-09-21,5,Took a day trip to visit family and the aquarium. Got very lucky to catch them on a weekend when they were focusing on the sea otters which was awesome! Overall though the aquarium was a great experience. Definitely worth the 3 hour trip!
1972,2011-08-22,4,"I've been reminded again of just how much I'm fascinated by aquatic animals and marine life. Growing up in the bay area, Monterey Bay Aquarium is not even that far, yet despite my proximity, I had not been here since I was a bratty, 10-year old fourth grader (oh wait, that description still applies..). So I'm happy I got to come back as an adult and appreciate the treasure trove even more. The staff did a great job with the jellyfish showroom. I never knew there were so many different kinds of jellyfish! They're such exotic, mesmerizing creatures and the aquarium captured them beautifully. The aquarium lighting amidst the dark showroom illuminated the jellies' natural essence. I really couldn't stop gawking in awe and wonder.The sea otter exhibit is really cute. There were two otters and one was rolling around in a tub of ice like a gangster rolling around in a pile of money - he was so happy and unaffected by the entertained crowd!I also really liked watching the circular aquarium full of fish all swimming frantically in one direction. I cheer for the lone, non-conformist fish that swims against the current and against the crowd (though every now and then he swims alongside the crowd, then changes his mind again and swims in the other direction).I'm a little disappointed there weren't more sharks or larger aquatic  animals, but I suppose it would be difficult to maintain such creatures. Still thoroughly enjoyed my visit as an adult :)"
1973,2015-11-28,5,"Not a lot to say...World Famous, have been going for about 25 years when I live in the area, Their work extends beyond the aquarium itself."
1974,2015-03-24,5,Wow! What an experience! This place is above and beyond amazing! The jellyfish exhibit was my favorite but everything was incredible! Totally worth the admission.
1975,2015-10-26,5,I went to this aquarium with my boyfriend for his birthday and we loved it! So much fun! Loved all the little shops and there were so many amazing restaurants within walking distance.
1976,2015-01-18,5,"Weekends and holidays can be very crowded. Off season and weekdays have been nearly empty when we went. My wife/kids and I are members and have been here on 3 different occasion. The first was a weekend during summer, it was packed and hard to really enjoy with our young children. The second time was a weekend in the fall, less busy. The third time we came on a Thursday in December (2014) and it was nearly empty. The weather was poor, maybe this helped keep the crowds down.Aside from the crowds the aquarium really has a lot to see in a (relatively) small space. If you take the time to appreciate all of the life that is there, you will enjoy it. My kids both love it and we will continue to renew our membership even though the 3 hour drive only allows us to visit a few times a year."
1977,2016-07-15,5,"This place is awesome! It's right down town and walking distance from the Monterey Plaza hotel & spa. And not to mention right off the water. So beautiful. The exhibits were bright, colorful, and full of animals/sea creatures. I would definitely return and the price for tickets were very affordable if purchased prior to your visit and then you also don't have wait in the line :)"
1978,2016-07-13,5,"Wow. Really great until I got tired and it got crowded. Otherwise, it is heavenly. Friendly staff, interesting exhibits, nice vistas. Really good to get out for lunch and come back."
1979,2014-09-10,5,"Pictures speak louder than words, so here's a sneak peak of what to expect at the aquarium! You will be filled with wonder and surprise, and you'll never know what you'll stumble upon next at this world-renowned aquarium.  Looking forward to our next visit soon!"
1980,2014-04-25,4,"I came here on Easter Sunday with a couple of my friends, and the aquarium was bustling with families! The exhibits themselves were fascinating and very diverse -- one of my favorites was the art made out of recycled trash found in the ocean! We also got to see the otter feeding -- tip: get there about 5-10 min early to get a good viewing spot! Otherwise, you might be pushed out to the back... There is also a cool petting zoo! The aquarium takes about 2-3 hours to go through on first pass; you may take longer if you prefer to revisit some exhibits and sit down to rest. The gift shop is also a fun place to visit after your trip. The staff there is super friendly and strikes up a fun conversation with the customers. All in all, a great place for family and friends, just beware on the weekends because it can also be very, very crowded."
1981,2016-04-15,5,"The third time for me, second time for my wife, and first time for our two teenage boys.  Probably the best aquarium we've ever visited.  Not cheap by any means, but worth it.  We were there on the edge of spring break, and we couldn't get any of the side tours (book ahead!) and we were lucky to show up an hour early because the lines to get in get long.  Very friendly employees, one grabbed us to come see the ""walk of the penguins"" where the staff move them from the back to the exhibit, and that might have been the highlight.  They have a very nice and well-priced gift shop also.  Wonderful, wonderful place.  Side tip: it was too cold to kayak with the sea otters, but I hear if you go to the franchise's location in Moss Bay (?) that's better than in town."
1982,2012-05-22,5,"Ive been here a few times before and membership is definitely worth it with a family.The lines are shorter for members and you get invites and other benefits with membership.We saw the new Jellies experience and my kids loved it, you can push down on one exhibit and watch your jelly fish move, or draw your own jelly fish and launch it into the viewing screen, view different kinds of jellyfish, and even see how they are grown.The weekend we went whole foods had a bunch of samples to give out and taste so that made it fun...Great place to spend the day with family and kids have lots of fun."
1983,2014-08-02,3,"There were some lovely parts of this aquarium however, it was way overpriced in my opinion.  I do not feel it should've cost more than $25 per adult. $40 per ticket seems extremely high. We had seen everything within an hour and a half and were ready to leave.  I always try to stay positive and look at the bright side so I figure it's a one time experience. So we made the most of our hour and a half and had fun. Though we had even more fun the remainder of the day exploring the beaches of Monterey and Carmel eating sandwiches.  I also meant to mention that you will have to pay for parking and that's not cheap unless you find street parking which you will need quarters for."
1984,2016-06-20,3,"I normally don't complain about an admission price, but $50/adult is just a little over the top.  There are some good exhibits here - the deep sea exhibit is really cool with the tuna, the kelp forest is great, and the beach exhibit is great.But $50/adult is so much.  Hitting the state parks in Big Sur was a much better experience.  I would do that instead."
1985,2016-09-03,5,I can't say enough about this wonderful place. One of the nicest aquariums in the United States and well worth the 5-8 hours to see everything. Highly recommended.
1986,2014-09-02,5,Love love LOVE the Aquarium.  The best place to see ocean life and learn how to save and protect it. So interactive for kids. Such an amazing place. A must see. You see something new every time we go.
1987,2016-08-02,5,The best aquarium I've ever been to! They also offer a military discount.
1988,2013-08-18,3,"This place has not aged well. The signage is tacky and worn out, the glass (plastic?) is cloudy and dull, and the exhibits are not what they used to be. The Academy of Science in SF or the aquarium in Chattanooga provide a much more interesting and modern atmosphere to observe marine wildlife.Sure, newer things always seem ""better"", but frankly I'm just unhappy at the lack of maintenance. The tanks and wildlife displayed are definitely interesting, but the museum as a whole seems like they haven't worked to update or upkeep it since 1995.Considering this is one of the primary reasons to go to Monterey, and continues to draw an astounding amount of tourists, I find that really disappointing."
1989,2016-08-02,5,"This is a great aquarium, well worth the visit. It can get very crowded, so plan about three hours to see everything. I was especially impressed with the thought that went into the exhibits and how clean everything was - they put a lot of care into keeping everything nice."
1990,2016-01-31,5,"It was an awesome experience here at the aquarium! I had so many favorite moments. I would have to say my favorite was seeing the jelly fish exhibit.  It was cool watching them swim around and actually seeing them up close. It was also cool seeing one that lit up with a bunch of colors such as red, blue, and green. They were all very interesting to look at. My other favorite was seeing the part called the Open Sea where you see the sea turtles, big group of fishes, tiger sharks swimming in one tank. It gave a nice effect as if you were at the middle bottom of the sea with a bright light overhead. (Hence why it was called 'Open Sea'). It was relaxing to watch in the seats provided. I also really liked the room where it was the group of fishes swimming around you. It was pretty mesmerizing watching the group of fishes swimming in the same direction continuously.  I also also enjoyed seeing the sea otter feeding! Oh my gosh!! They were so cute! The way they would swim around and then lay on their backs as they swam! It was fun watching them.  Another cool thing I saw was all the 'Finding Nemo' fishes swimming in one tank. Hehe.  There was also some areas where you could touch particular sea animals. Really cool.Many many cool things I got to see here! The ones I described were my top favorite parts! Definitely worth going!"
1991,2013-05-27,4,"Monterey bay aquarium was a whole lot of fun and a bit of torture. Pro tip #1: Get there early. Pro tip #2: pre-purchase your tickets to express your way to the main entrance and avoid the long lines. Pro-tip #3: for the otter feeding be on the second level early and I mean early -- the crowd is unforgiving and quite hostile. Pro-tip #4: take a break from the screaming rugrats everywhere, stamp your wrist (with invisible UV ink-stamp) before leaving the aquarium, go to a bar for liquid courage and return for easy re-entry at the main entrance for round two. Rinse and repeat. When you're done, a few steps from the exit is the tourist trolley, hop on it and head to the nearest or furthest bar for  liquid therapy.You're welcome."
1992,2015-12-01,5,Hands down the most amazing aquarium I've ever had the pleasure of visiting.  Put this one on your bucket list!
1993,2013-06-18,5,"I love the aquarium. It allows us land dwellers to see the magical world of the ocean. No matter how old or young you are, its always an awe of wonder and fascination when you see sea life. What I love most about this particular aquarium is the abundant variations of jellyfish. They're floating, delicate, sea aliens! Dangerously beautiful is what I think of them. And another great collection are the sea horses. Another intriguing animal. They glide so effortlessly in water and its so crazy how they look like horses.Make sure your mobile is at full charge because you're going to be taking so many pictures."
1994,2017-01-31,1,"This place is a rip off!! I came here a few years ago and the ticket was not more than $30 for an adult and now it's $50.... absolutely ridiculous. We went the day before New Year's Eve, so obviously the aquarium is gonna be a little more crowded, but it was just nuts! I don't know how they can justify charging people that amount of money and we literally couldn't see much of the exhibits because there were so many people. They really should have a limit of how many people they allow in there at one time. We complained about this and asked how it isn't a hazard to have that many people crammed into one area. The girl gave us some strange answer, saying that the fire dept doesn't allow them to put a maximum occupancy due to them having all the outdoor space?? Huh???? It just seems to me that they're greedy; taking people's money for the full value, not caring that their patrons are having a sub par experience. I honestly felt unsafe having my 5 month old there because there were just too many people there to maintain any type of personal space. They gave us 3 free passes for our troubles so we could come again at a less busier time. I honestly would have just liked our money back because I'd rather not go there ever again. The Long Beach aquarium is much closer to us anyway."
1995,2017-08-28,5,"It was our first trip to the aquarium.. we took the trolley from the parking garage to the facility and it was great. They run every 15 minutes and you have great views during trip.. now the aquarium is breathtaking.. i loved every bit of it, i think i was more excited than my kids. You can tell staff enjoy what they do.  There are many diffrent activities for children and the wave of splashing water is a must picture moment. My kids favorite parts were the stingray petting, jelly fish area, open sea and the otter exhibit. We did do a behind the scene tour for the family but really regret it as it was more talking than anything else. We did leave to have lunch, as we were told we only needed to get hand stamped to be let back in, thats awesome!!!We all had a great time and will definitely be back"
1996,2016-08-27,5,"The aquarium is fantastic! Its nice to have such a large and developed aqurium in our community. The museum has a lot of lovely and magnificent creatures, but you have to be prepared to have a lot of space on your phone to take photos, and to come early to see all of the aquarium, and try to prepare for all the walking and being tired, cause this is a large aquarium. Great place, nice staff, and amazing view from the deck. Will definitely go back when in the area."
1997,2012-07-16,4,"This was my first time visiting the aquarium.   I was in the area after going to Del Monte Shopping Center to visit the Apple Store, and decided to stop at the aquarium. Loved the different aquarium fish displays. It was hard to walk through the place and not know what I'd already seen and what I hadn't yet seen!  A very fun time.  Definitely want to go again one day.  If you haven't been here, I recommend you come at least once.   There is a lot to see and you will have fun.  There will be at least one display that you will enjoy. I glanced at but didn't get anything at  some of the gift shops.  I later sat outside and glanced at the ocean.  And I wasn't aware of the discount for parking if you are AAA member.   Will have to remember that if I ever go again."
1998,2016-04-05,5,Great education programs.  Beautiful views.  All volunteers are to be commended. Top notch location.  Very well kept venue.
1999,2014-02-26,4,"Very pricey.. But they have some good exhibits. The jelly fish exhibits are amazing. I could sit there all day and watch them.. Until the idiots let their kids bang on the glass or the people who are oblivious to the ""no flash"" signs show up."
2000,2017-08-26,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is an absolutely beautiful location. Plenty of sea life to check out. It was a very informative experience. Shoutout to Emily at the ticket booth, she was great!"
2001,2016-01-20,4,"I love that this aquarium was so clean! Most I have been to have been a little grimey and not well cared for. The exhibits are not bad, but they don't hold my interest for very long. You definitely can be done with this place in 2 hours. Unfortunately if was raining heavily when I visited, so I didn't get to see the tide pool. My only gripe is the price, it's absolutely outrageous compared to what you get."
2002,2013-10-21,5,"We have had the chance to visit several aquariums around the country including the New England Aquarium in Boston and the Seattle Aquarium, but the Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the best ones we've ever been to.  I didn't think anything would top the New England Aquarium, but they have done it here.Their exhibits, especially the jellyfish were breath taking and the number of activities for children was immense.  There were play areas for kids, many touch tanks and interactive learning games.  Our 20-month old daughter had a great time.The only downside is the visit is a bit on the costly side, running just under $80 for two adults (our daughter was free).  But I felt it was worth the cost."
2003,2014-07-08,4,"I went here last year after over 5 years ago and it was just as cool as before! Only downside is finding parking :PGreat new exhibit about jellyfish! It was so cool seeing them glow in the water. There was also a cool exhibit on seahorses. Overall, a great place to learn new things about marine life, especially for kids."
2004,2013-09-18,4,"Since I was in the area on Labor Day weekend, we decided to see what everyone was talking about.  Turns out the aquarium is a pretty cool place.  Most memorable points would have to be: the huge tank with all the sharks, oversized fish, turtles; jellyfish exhibit was very interesting to watch; and there always has to be a gigantic octopus.  All of the creatures were interesting to look at when you could get up close enough to see then.It's a family place, so kids everywhere, and I mean everywhere!  I was constantly dodging them to keep from being run over.  We avoided the section where you could touch the animals because it was just too crowded.  My boyfriend and I were definitely ready to go in less than an hour and a half.It's way smaller than aquariums I've been to on the East Coast and at $35/person, it was a bit too pricey for what you get.  We parked in some business's parking lot at the beach entrance and walked about 20 minutes to get there, so definitely got our exercise in, but the parking was free.  If you don't mind splurging a bit, or get lucky enough to get discount tickets, it's worth going at least once."
2005,2015-07-01,5,"Always a ""must visit"" on a return trip to Monterey!  Friendly, helpful employees.  Always something fun and new to see and experience!  Love the Monterey Aquarium!"
2006,2014-04-28,4,"-1 star because they don't have a large exhibit dedicated to sharks !!!!Aside from that, the service is A+. The employees are very enthusiastic and informative about their jobs! One of them even took us behind the scenes to see the process of replenishing a jug of moon jellies !! And guess what? moon jellies are easy to take care of, and you could even purchase them for your home !!! (madness I know) sadly the aquarium itself is not allowed to sell them. Beautiful and Scenic layout + aquariums. I could've sat there for hours on end, admiring the majestic creatures of the Sea."
2007,2014-01-11,4,"My wife and I went here on our road trip, and it's just as impressive as these reviews make it sound.  Tons of great exhibits, special presentations going around the clock, and the food was surprisingly good.  The only thing that was a little disappointing was the lack of speed to get our tickets and get in the door.  There was a huge line in the building that went out the door and down the street, and the line was moving SO SLOW.  The reason for this is because they're trying to up-sell people into getting City Passes or annual passes for the aquarium, and it took way too long for people to make up their minds.  They need an express line for the people who just want to get in for the day.  It shouldn't be that complicated.Once we get over the original frustration, the actual exhibits are great.  I loved it!"
2008,2014-02-19,4,Came here on Sunday with my husband and kids .. The line was wrapped around the place and up the hill . Only took about 15 20 minutes when it looked like it was gonna take  over a hour ... other than being wayy over crowded we had a a great time ... The kids loved to see the penguins especially!! .. only reason why I Put 4 stars was because there way over priced ... should be a little lower do everyone would be able to come and enjoy !
2009,2011-07-19,2,"I'm surprised that there are so many great reviews for this place.  Personally, I wasn't very impressed.When you enter the aquarium, this place is full of energy and excitement.  There are tons of people all over the place, especially cutsie pootsie little kids :) At first, you're so excited and can't wait to get in, but boy does that excitement dwindle down...So you begin to walk around the aquarium and you notice how small the place actually is. I started to feel bad for all the animals trapped into such small spaces. The flamingo's and turtles are what animals I felt terrible for.  Two sea turtles had to share a really small aquarium.  It looked like they couldn't swim comfortably. I felt terrible for them.  The pink flamingo's were practically side by side in their stuffy little habitat.As for the large aquarium where all the marine life resided, that was the only place that I felt was adequate to house animals.I'm not an expert on how to treat wildlife or any other of these exotic creatures, but I know that it didn't sit well with me knowing that the majority of the animals were housed in such small habitats.Sorry, no bueno for me.P.S.I am not an affiliate of PETA."
2010,2014-10-16,5,"What an amazing place!!! The price is well worth the admission. Such an educational and entertaining trip. The sites are amazing!! Also,the staff is phenomenal."
2011,2016-07-17,5,"A huge thank you to supervisor, Kirt... Our hotel was sold out of the 2-for-1 passes and we had a limited time to visit on Sunday night and wanted to return on Monday to spend most of the day. Kirt honored the deal and we spent a great evening enjoying the Aquarium, listening to jazz music and drinking a glass of wine with limited crowds. We will be back tomorrow for the whole tourist experience. The customer service was outstanding and I thank Kirt for making this a great way to spend an evening!"
2012,2017-07-17,5,Wonderful place to visit with kiddos! Get the membership and get the early access on weekends. It is worth the peace and quiet to have the museum to your family.
2013,2011-07-05,5,"There are 1,000 for this joint so I'll keep it brief... I'm a local who went here the first week it opened in the 80s... so take this for what it's worth.- this place rocks but gets ridiculously crowded on weekends and in the summer so come early.- if you bring a stroller please practice stroller etiquette by not running over people's feet or kids. When you're in a cramped exhibit, park your stroller.- if you plan on visiting more than 4 times in a year get the membership.- the lingcod and wolf eel are badass.- your kids will love it.- don't act like a tourist.... Don't bang on the glass. let other people in to view the fish. Hanging out in front of the tank for 30 mins isn't cool.- you're going to get brow-beat about how humans are destroying the planet.I still love it and will continue to go and stare at the wolf eel. You should too."
2014,2016-03-31,4,"so many fish--so many people. The aquarium is great, but there are so many little side exhibits near the actual fish that the children seem to freak out over the little games as much as for the actual nature of it all. Still, the location, the scenery, the whole thing is incredible."
2015,2013-12-24,3,"It's not that impressive. Without the free tickets, I don't think I would be spending that much for this aquarium. It's always so crowded and the exhibits are so little. The glasses were so DIRTY! I understand that tons of kids would be there and touching, but for the price you charged for admission, you should keep it up and at least have someone constantly wipe off all the hand marks. EEEErrrr."
2016,2012-06-23,3,"Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.  I wasn't impressed.  Maybe my expectations were too high after all the years of hearing how impressive the aquarium is.  Maybe it was the crowd...I don't know. I was impressed by the extensive seahorse and jellyfish exhibit.  But that's about it.  If you haven't gone, I would recommend going at least once. If you have to choose between doing the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the 17 Mile Drive, do the 17 Mile Drive.  You get to see seals and sea otters in their natural habitat. That's as good as it gets."
2017,2013-09-01,3,"Very cool place to go butas Tevina said, you can't park anywhere close. By the time I walked from where I paid 15 dollars to park, I was almost too tired to even go through the aquarium. I did my best. But didn't get my money's worth, that's for sure.I can say I've been there. But that's about all."
2018,2011-11-20,4,"I scarcely remember visiting Monterey Bay Aquarium when I was a little girl for a field trip. So when my friend brought that idea of going there, I quickly jumped in! ""Lets go!"" It took us 3 weeks to go due to our working schedules but we made it happen.Parking was horrendous. To think you would expect a public parking structure for such a family activity, there is none. Well, there is one but it fits about 50 cars. Really? So we spent 10-15 minutes driving around looking for street parking. Atlas, we found one a few blocks down in a residential area. Which wasn't bad at all. We got to walk along side the waters and see seals laying on the sand.It was nice to see fishes in tanks but I was more in awe when we went to the school of silver fish section. I felt like a little girl seeing fishes for the first time. There was this dome shape aquarium where a school of fishes are swimming in circles. I stood there for a second (actually more) and just enjoyed the moment.As we walked further into the blue like aquarium I felt more appreciative of the world around us. Especially the sea. Although I will never be brave enough to go snorkeling or deep sea diving, I definitely appreciate the little creatures and fishes and mammals that lives in it. =]I like the little interaction activities in the kids area. I had a little fun there.I felt like a kid all over again. Overall, I enjoyed it very much. I think my friend did too.I will return again..."
2019,2013-09-10,5,We usually make a day of it and we stay nice and relaxed. Perfect place to take family and friends when they come to visit. There is definitely enough things going on to keep you busy for the whole day. We usually come when they first open. Then we take a lunch break and go walk around Cannery Row. Don't forget your invisible re-entry stamps! After lunch we go back into the aquarium. There are so many interactive stations for the kids. Kids and adults are mesmerized by the humongous  tanks of beautiful sea life.
2020,2017-08-13,3,Amazing live seafood but very difficult for locals to enjoy the wonders because its always crowded
2021,2016-05-11,5,"Although I have visited this aquarium many times, I never tire of experiencing the exhibits and the touch pools.  Frequently there is a new exhibit which draws me in, but I find that those that I have seen frequently keep me mesmerized the most.  The amount of research that is shared with visitors is monumental yet is presented in an entertaining and visually stunning way.  There are always knowledgeable hosts or volunteers nearby for the inevitable questions about the creatures, habitats and present status of what is available to see. It is a challenge to experience each exhibit before collapsing from sensory overload, but I power ahead, not wanting to miss anything.  One of the biggest draws for me is the interactive experiences that the aquarium offers its visitors.  It is impossible to be bored here!"
2022,2016-07-12,3,"A really nice aquarium and just the right size to have a lot of different things to see.  You can tell that they are proud of it, when you buy a ticket.  Its pricey.  Considering the cost, give yourself a few hours, especially if you have children.  If you just expect to do a walk-through, its not worth the cost.  Recommend you bring a sweater as it can get chilly depending on the time of day.  If you live locally, its worth buying a season pass as you'll save in the long run and you can go when the tourist crowds are less, its a cool and cloudy day, or your kids only have an attention span of more than a half hour."
2023,2011-07-15,5,I have been to Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta and Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga. Both of their own charms but Monterey Bay is still my favorite. i don't know if I am just partial because it was the very first aquarium I have been to. It is not an exaggeration to call it my first love. The jellyfish exhibit is still the most mesmerizing even after all these years. Note that this Aquarium do not have any mammals except otters. If you are looking to see some whales and dolphins you will be very disappointed. It is also a non profit organization so the main focus is to educate rather than to entertain. That doesn't mean you won't have a great time here. You will learn a lot about the sea and the nature. There are no better place to bring your kids to. They will love it and so will you.
2024,2008-07-16,4,"It's really a place where you can go to once every blue moon.  My favorite part is watching the Jellyfish and also sitting right next to the HUGE tank w/ the sharks (i sat down and layed the side of my head against the glass cause i was tired, and then a huge shark passes by RIGHT next to the glass! It was way freaky but totally fun at the same time!)The best part is how the aquarium promotes saving the sea and also offers the best sources for where we buy our seafood from. I'm against zoos so this place really wows me in terms of how they really take care of ocean life :)"
2025,2013-05-21,4,"Admission is pretty pricey and it could be a pain-in-the-butt if you visit during a day when there's a field trip going on, but other than that - I'm sure anyone who visits channels their inner fish and feels the serenity of the aquarium."
2026,2014-03-31,3,"I came here expecting an awesome Aquarium, however my overall experience was just OK.I haven't been to an aquarium in a while so i thought it would be something nice to do!  Now first off, i've been to a couple of Aquariums, including the biggest one in Georgia.  So i have quite an high expectation when it comes to aquariums.  It started off pretty strong by displaying a lot of interesting fishes and attraction!  They start off with a giant octopus! How can you top a giant octopus?!  After that, it gets steadily okay.  I'm not saying it was boring, but it does get steadily bland after the beginning.  They do have somewhat of diverse fish community but it seems all the same to me.Im not telling you not to come here, but i do want you to be prepared and not get your hopes high if you're expecting a 5 Star Aquarium!~"
2027,2016-08-09,5,"This aquarium is so beautiful.  There is so much ocean life to see!  I recommend the aquarium for those that are spending a couple of days in Monterey.  This is one of the things you will not want to miss.  also... take a drive on 17 mile road.  It is such a beautiful drive, and a place to take some breath-taking photos."
2028,2015-10-16,5,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of my favorite places to relax. My absolute favorite exhibit is the jelly fish no matter what is happening in my life it calms me down. I would definitely recommend not going on the weekends because this place is always very busy.
2029,2014-01-05,4,Beautiful aquarium right by the water. Small enough to see in one hour and has beautiful jellyfish and fishes.
2030,2013-06-14,4,"Yes, it's a good experience....the first...or second timeBut....been there...done that"
2031,2016-08-07,5,"It has been at least 8 years since we have visited Monterey Bay Aquarium, and we were not disappointed!  While it was crowded at first, the crowds thinned and we were able to enjoy the touch pools and exhibits.  Considering returning for a second day today!  It has definitely grown in size!  And the volunteers were awesome!  They were knowledgeable and happy to explain and let us hold the hermit crabs, show us the decorator crabs or feed the abalone....this was a great day!"
2032,2014-08-13,4,"I love it here but it was super crowded due to it being summer time.  I would have given them 5 stars if not for the crowds and people behaving badly!  My favorite section was the jellyfish - they are so graceful, majestic and mesmerizing!  The sea otters, deep sea section and the kelp forest were also very interesting.  The special feature was the tentacles exhibit but it seemed more fluffy than substanital.  I'd like to come again when it's not so busy and the viewing glass is cleaner.  there were finger prints galore today."
2033,2013-07-23,5,"Given that the Monterey Bay Aquarium has over 1500 positive reviews and a 4+ star approval rating, I will be brief.This is one of the coolest aquariums I have ever been to, and the amount of sea-life available to see is simply amazing.They have a great 'hands-on' exhibit for those looking to get up-close-and-personal with the sea life as well as a great 'under sea' exhibit that houses the largest tank in the United States/west coast. Also, the aquarium is located directly on protected kelp beds where wild otters and sea lions live together and can be seen from the back deck of the establishment.Worth the drive and time it takes to get there.Bucket list material for sure."
2034,2012-02-21,4,"Spent a great few hours at the Monterey Bay Aquarium! Got to see the otters and penguins being fed, and caught an informational talk about albatross. The otters were probably the best part, since they're fostering an otter pup right now (and apparently the otters are what they're known for?) but we really enjoyed the seahorse exhibit as well, and the two giant tanks on either side of the aquarium.They did a great job of managing enormous crowds on a busy and chilly President's Day-- we never felt like we were being jostled around or had to wait excessively long to see anything, and we always had a great view of the demonstrations and talks.  Our only complaint would probably be the lack of nearby convenient parking-- all the spots in the area are governed by different rules and take different forms of payment. I've somehow managed to walk away with six dollar coins that we never used.It is pretty expensive for its size (they have no marine mammals besides the otters)... You can see the whole aquarium in about three or four hours, and the entrance fee is over $30. But you know it's going to a good cause for sure-- especially when you see the baby otter playing in the tank!"
2035,2016-04-16,5,"We love the aquarium and now that we live in Monterey we have become members.  Their member packages are great and come with guest passes. My favorite exhibits are the jellyfish and sardines swimming in endless circles.  They have a great booth on sustainable fish to eat as well.  Beat the crowds if you can, but that's a hard task since it's such an amazing place!"
2036,2014-11-06,5,"This Aquarium has given my family one of our most cherished moments. Beside the fact that it's a terrific aquarium with spectacular exhibits, and all of the inspiring work they do with conservation and rehabilitation behind the scenes, they worked personally and beautifully with my (now) fiancé to coordinate his surprise proposal to me! In front of the open ocean exhibit, before General admittance, so we could have an intimate and beautiful experience...not to mention the employee who helped played along with keeping it a big surprise!! She even took pictures of the moment! Being a HUGE all things nautical fan, and so thankful and blessed by the people who make the aquarium happen, I sent them an email after our trip thanking them for being so wonderful.  They sent us a care package a week later with a hand written card, a stuffed Mola Mola ( my absolute favorite sea creature!) and 4 complimentary tickets so we can go back.  You really can't have a better experience than that. These guys are passionate, kind, and generous - with their mission for the sea, and the devotion to their costumers/fans! We truly love you, Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
2037,2014-02-15,3,"Overall had a pretty good experience.  It was REALLY crowded and that took away a bit from some of the fun.  It was hard to get close to some of the exhibits.  The penguins were cute and the deep tank is amazing.  However, they made a big deal about the otters and a new baby otter, but there weren't any otters in the display (or they were hiding).  We went by several times and it appeared empty.  There was also a tone of ""humans are bad people"" with several guilt displays.  I get awareness building and it's importance, but it seemed a bit heavy handed.  I'd recommend it to someone who wanted to go, but I'd recommend going on a weekday if you can and don't have your heart set on seeing any particular sea critter."
2038,2011-09-19,5,"This place was amazing, definitely worth 5+ stars. I'll admit I was a little apprehensive of the ticket price, but afterward I definitely feel it was worth it. The seahorse exhibit was exceptional. The whole place is laid out really well and it's a nice relaxing time. I like that they pipe in music to add to the ambiance. Every staff member and volunteer we ran into was super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place and I'd love to go back."
2039,2016-03-27,5,I love coming to the Monterey Aquarium any chance I get. I recently moved to the area and I have visited the Aquarium at least 3 times. The staff is super knowledgeable. Down side is that it is always so crowded no matter the day. But hey it's a hot spot. My favorite exhibit is the jellyfish. They have so many species to explore and so much information about each specific type. I love jotting down some notes so I won't forget the amazing details about my favorites.
2040,2013-03-30,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must-see if you are visiting the area!! Definitely the best aquarium I've been to with so many different exhibits and cute animals! Student admission is $31.95, but year-long membership is only $50, which is a bargain if you plan on visiting at least twice a year. Plus, membership is tax-deductible too!If you want to maximize your time, it's best to go in the morning so you can plan out your schedule. There are various animal feedings and narrated videos in the auditorium throughout the day, so you don't want to come too late and miss what you want to see! On my most recent visit, I saw ""Luna: A Sea Otter's Story,"" which was a super adorable and heartwarming story. The exhibits are always changing, so check the website for details!There are also touch pools and other interactive activities interspersed throughout the exhibits. Very informative for kids and adults too! There's even a cafe on the ground floor and several gift shops to get some souvenirs.TIPS: Set aside half a day so you can make it through all the exhibits at a comfortable pace! There's a parking lot up the block that offers all day parking for $15 if you don't want to worry about meters and spend the whole day exploring the aquarium and Cannery Row!"
2041,2015-10-24,5,"Wonderful place to visit. Great exhibits, wonderful hands on activities for kiddos. I enjoy the shows and watching feeding happen as well. Loved the Sat/Sun evening hours with jazz music this summer. So special!"
2042,2015-02-09,5,"If you want to see some jaw - dropping underwater exhibits come here. The way that exhibits are set up, besides the weird dazed and confused jellies exhibit, are stunning.I walked to the open sea for my first exhibit and it was the perfect start for the day. Seeing just how many fish were so close and so full of life was simply incredible.The variety of animals here are also really impressive, it was the first time I ever saw a live octopus, which is really neat! After 3 hours most of the exhibits had been seen and our party started to wear down. But it is well worth the value."
2043,2015-05-22,2,"Nice aquarium, but to be honest, small. Have you visited Lisbon aquarium? If you have, don't waste your money. Great and valuable work and info on conservation and ecology but overpriced for what it offers."
2044,2013-03-11,5,This aquarium was amazing. The gigantic whale elevated above the showroom floor was a wonder all by itself. Luckily we had got there early and had plenty of time to enjoy the entire aquarium without having to worry about time. The self guided tour was fun! Haven't done anything like that since I was a child. The various tanks they had with a vast species of fish was impressive. This is a must see if you are around the Monterey Bay Area. Tip: Arrive early so you can enjoy the aquarium without being rushed. Plenty of interesting fact throughout each section. Wear comfy shoes this place is huge
2045,2013-03-14,4,"cannery row, tourist destination...pay to park and stroll...a visit to the monterey bay aquarium...$thirty-four.fifty per person entrance...colorful jellyfish...majestic sea horses...live penguin feeding...inside a tidal wave without the wet...pet a starfish or pesky hermit crab...touch, feel, turn, push and play for the children..magnificent sea turtles, sharks, tuna and more...otter lookout post...theatre for ocean education only comfortable seating rest...tanks after tanks of sea critters and monster eels...lounge on bench facing a large aquarium...bench seating quite uncomfortable...few stores for rubber/plastic sea creatures and dolls...single cafeteria for high priced food...wishing for a little more to do...two floors of observing and walking..."
2046,2013-11-14,5,"We were very happy to finally get the chance to see this place. The open water exhibit is breath taking and gives a sense of wonder from all the different forms of life. As young adults, my girlfriend and I were happy to make Monterey one of our stops on our coastal road trip. There are a significant amount of kids but being a center for ocean education, we were still happy to watch otters float around and coastal birds bask in the heat lamps.Would love to drive up again from Southern California for another visit soon!"
2047,2011-04-27,3,"I cant help but compare this one with the Vancouver Aquarium. And I have to say that the other was the same as this but had more animals and was bigger. Maybe I had too high hopes , as this one was meant to be world renowned. But it's a great diversion for kids in the mornin and ending with Cannery Row. They have tons of interactive activities. There are a lot of fish but the most popular exhibits were small and crowded. (sea otters, penguins)One of the interesting things was te history of cannery row and how the aquarium converted from a cannery to what it is today$30 per person. No need if you've recently seen a big one before."
2048,2015-08-20,4,"4 stars for the facility - beautiful, educational, and diverse - but 3 stars for the overall experience. There were way, way too many people to be able to enjoy the exhibits (even on a Thursday!). I couldn't see half of them because of rude tourists literally shoving me to take pictures and kids slamming the glasses and running around. Didn't want to mark them down here because obviously, it's not the aquarium's fault they're so popular :(BECAUSE their exhibits are just so fun! The Jellies Experience was unexpected and put jellyfish in a different super-funky perspective. The outdoor deck where you can sit and view the bay was probably one of my favorite parts, though!!! We saw a whale in the distance, seals, and an otter float by on its belly!Definitely recommend Monterey if you or your kids are really into marine life - please just remember aquarium etiquette so it's enjoyable for both you and everyone around you!"
2049,2013-02-12,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a very family-friendly place to come by for an educational, exciting and fun-filled adventure. Do come and view the many different exhibits available. As well, some are hands-on and make for a wonderful experience for kids of all ages.Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The place itself is really quite wondrous - do visit and judge for yourself!"
2050,2013-09-04,3,"It's been a while since I was last here and there've been changes since. Not good ones unfortunately. As usual, depending on when you get there, there's the potential for crazy long lines (likely when bus loads of tourist arrive so pick your time. Another way to skip the lines is to buy your tickets online and show them the bar code on your phone to scan and you're in!The new or more revamped exhibits, jelly fish and sea horses have been expanded and while seeing the little critters were awesome, the exhibits themselves are a bit cheesy with the whole disco vibe. Folks with kids will hate me for this but the exhibits have become overly ""kiddy"" with too many touchy feely play exhibits. Great for kids but less so for adults who want to learn about the animals but not look like an idiot.For the edge of the Ocean side of the aquarium, those are still amazing to see but hey, they're starting to show their age so they really need to update those.Tip: if after all that walking, you need a caffeine shot of regular coffee, skip the line at the coffee bar and just self serve from the pots behind the coffee bar, then head to the cashiers to pay. Go to the coffee bar only if you want espresso drinks. There's only one barista and it's a long wait."
2051,2013-11-10,5,"I was very impressed by my visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I've been to a number of aquariums, but I've never found one with such amazing displays and engaging staff.As I walked around seeing the numerous exhibits, I was constantly engaged by the staff. They explained numerous things about the exhibits and drew me into conversation. Given so many staff are content to stand around quietly at other locations, it was a pleasant surprise.The location itself is also amazing. There are great water views from numerous look out points. And the exhibits are simply world-class. Make sure you see the retro-themed Jellyfish experience, which is something I'll never forget.While you're there make sure you check out the daily events. I saw a penguin feeding, a fish show, and a movie about a seal in the auditorium. Pick the ones that interest you, and go!If you find yourself in the Monterey-area, make sure you stop by here!"
2052,2015-07-25,1,"Monterey Bay Aquarium, just a suggestion, discount your entry fee 1 hour before closing, you're losing money by not doing this."
2053,2013-02-20,5,"It's been years since I've visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium and things have changed for the better!We went during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend and the crowds weren't as unbearable as I thought it was going to be.  It was actually busier on the Monday than the Sunday.  (I blame Sunday football being the reason.)Despite what other yelpers say about being able to go through the whole aquarium in a couple of hours, I highly doubt that's really possible to truly enjoy this aquarium in that short amount of time.  Heck, we didn't spend two entire days there and there was still a lot we missed!With the Little Guy in tow, we checked out the Open Sea Feeding, the Kelp Forest Feeding, and the Penguin Feeding.  We missed the Albatross Encounter though.  I don't recall the Open Sea Exhibit in the past, but wow!  I could spend hours in that room alone!  Sightings of sea turtles, a hammerhead shark, the sun fish, etc. will keep anyone entertained!  The Kelp Forest is nice to watch, not as dramatic as the Open Sea Exhibit for obvious reasons.  The Penguin Feeding is also very cute, although it's a pretty tight space.  Get there early for that one.With five different shows rotating in the auditorium, we could only wish we had time to sit through any of those!  Next time!The Jellies Experience alone is a great reason to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium!  We've been to another aquarium that had jellyfish, but nothing like this.  It's just so gorgeous they way they displayed it all!The Secret Lives of Seahorses is another not to miss attraction.  The number of seahorses they have here is insane!  And you can see them all so easily!Even the Giant Pacific Octopus was viewable!  Usually those guys are hidden away but this one was suctioned right to the glass!The Sea Otters exhibit along with the main dining area was closed for renovation.  I'm sure whatever they are working on will look great!Even the Touch Pools and Splash Zone are great areas for the kids to get some hands on fun and to let them run around a bit!Admission prices are: Adult Admission $34.95Ages 18-64 and not in college.Child Admission $21.95Ages 3-12. Children under 3 are free.Senior Admission $31.95Ages 65 and over.Student Admission $31.95 Ages 13-17 or in college.We were able to score a Two-Day Adult Admission Ticket for $32.95 from our hotel (Casa Munras).  So check with your hotel to see if they are offering any specials. Yearly Memberships:Ocean Advocate $2502 adults plus children,2 guest cards and more($195 tax-deductible)Member $1952 adults plus children(Fully tax-deductible)Individual $75(Fully tax-deductible)Student $50(Fully tax-deductible)Senior $50(Fully tax-deductible)If we lived closer, I would be all over having a membership here!  Parking is limited, so get there early to find the closer parking lot spaces. Wheelchairs are free to use on a first come, first serve basis.  There are also in and out privileges, so if you choose to grab a bite elsewhere, you can come back in easily.  Even the gift shops are nicely set up!  They have the typical touristy and junky stuff for the kids, and then they have the nice expensive stuff too.  Definitely worth checking it all out! Overall, one of the best aquariums I have been to in my life! It was always great in the past, but it's gotten even better!"
2054,2015-04-07,4,"Had such a fantastic time here with the hubby. Quite pricey yes, especially throwing in our private tours of the sea otters, a $5 bottle of water, and an overpriced magnet. But you learn how expensive it is to feed these creatures and somehow the chunk of change seems worth it. We loved learning about the cannery itself along with the different animals. The behind the scenes sea otter tour was amazing, definitely worth the extra $$. We will want to come back when baby is old enough to enjoy the kid friendly exhibits, but we will make sure it's during the week to avoid the overcrowding. Parking is kind of hectic also."
2055,2013-07-10,5,Best aquarium in the world and it is a quick drive away. I have been here many times and loved it every time. the most memorable experience is when they had a baby great white shark here. it is the only place in the world in which they have been able to get the great whites to feed in captivity. (i will post a photo of the great white). all of their other attractions are spectacular as well. when i go now i stay at one of the bed and breakfast places near by because you often get discounted tickets and sometimes tickets included in your stay.
2056,2015-12-28,5,"I spent most of my visit watching the jellies.  I agree with the reviewer who said each jellyfish tank is like a live performance art piece.  The open sea tank is impressive, the octopus is haunting, and the area with the rescued birds is cool (and the older man who works there was a great source of Monterey bird knowledge), but I would pay the admission price just to see the jellies."
2057,2016-05-04,5,Awesome. Busy on the weekends but worth it either way. Great fun for the kids and not too shabby for us old people either. A great time and a great area to explore after a day at the aquarium. You can go a bunch and still be surprised at what you've missed.  Best to buy tickets before hand A++
2058,2016-06-17,5,A must see if you are a visitor to the Monterey Area.  I am a local and have a membership.  Great place for a Sunday afternoon.  I always learn something new at the Aquarium.
2059,2013-07-31,5,"Let me begin with the fact that parking in Monterey Bay is challenging. One way roads going the wrong direction from the parking exacerbates the already challenging parking situation. So, stay calm. You can do it. It's one hundred percent worth it.     After parking at the parking garage ($10 for the whole day), I walked out, and grabbed the 'Welcome to Cannery Row' booklet off the display case just outside the doors. You should do that too, there's a bunch of helpful maps, write-ups and even some coupons in there. I smelled the salt air, and walked down to Cannery Row, and found my way to the very end of the street where the Aquarium was.    Helpful Aquarium employee outside the front door opened the door for me and directed me towards the ticket line, which was pretty empty around 1pm.  Another helpful Aquarium employee inside the door further directed me, even though I kinda-sorta knew where I was going. They're thorough. That's very cool.   After buying a ticket for $34, I began to wander around the place. I noted that they closed their doors at 6pm, so I had about five hours to explore the place. I was quickly lost in their wonderful exhibits. They've got alot of really neat stuff.  The notable things I saw this trip was their great big kelp forest in a big indoor/outdoor aquarium. They also had an albatross being displayed and taught about to a crowd of people. I'd never seen one up close. I also really enjoyed their great tide-pool exhibit, which simulates the area in which waves crash upon every few moments. In addition to the things I've mentioned, they've also got hundreds if not thousands of fascinating species of fish, animals and plants on display.  If you still need more, back in the day before it was an aquarium, it was a cannery. They've got a really great exhibit on how that used to work.  It's just interesting on so many facets. This place is a great place to learn and visit.      After some trial and error with my camera settings I finally figured out how to take pictures of dark underwater exhibits with no flash. Like the Giant Octopus. You've got to set the shutter speed waaaay down. I had good luck at 15-18. Just remember to re-set it when you go back outside or your pictures will be all white. I had to re-take a bunch of pictures of the wild seals basking and being generally cute on rocks outside. I'll definitely remember this trick for when I return; and return I will. This place is great and totally worth the 5 hour drive to get up there, and the challenging parking situation.          What first got me here a few years ago was a TV show on PBS about the great aquariums of the country. This one was ranked right at the top. (The New England Aquarium was also mentioned in that show) Shortly after I arrived, my inner nerd realized that this was the place they used in the Star Trek movie about the whales.  Bravo Monterey Bay Aquarium, Bravo."
2060,2013-07-30,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is considered the top aquarium in the world and it is easy to understand why.  Just the open water exhibit alone takes the cake.  I have not seen another aquarium that holds so much water that you can put full size tuna in it.  Occasionally, they will have a spectacular treat such as the great white shark they had for a short time.  Anyone who doubts the supremacy of Monterey Bay Aquarium, I dare them to find another place that has had a great white shark on display.  Then I dare them to jump in tank. The second most spectacular fish I ever saw was the Pacific sunfish.  Possibly the most disgusting looking animal on earth, it can grow to gargantuan sizes.  It is actually considered a planktonic organism. This fish is so ugly that when I take a picture next to it, it makes me look like Brad Pitt.  But like a horrifying traffic accident, I just could not look away. Unfortunately these two were no longer in the exhibit the last time I went, but I am definitely looking forward to the next fantastic creature they may have.  Perhaps a living vampire squid?The only thing that they don't have are sea lions and seals.  But just go to the wharf for that.  They are loud and stinky, so not a big loss in my book."
2061,2011-04-01,3,Perhaps I wasn't in the right mindset as I only partially enjoyed the place than years passed.It was a rainy day so everyone and their third cousin wanted to be there too. From the moment we got in I knew what a sardine felt like.Sure the exhibits are wonderful but it's hard to enjoy them when people are either hogging the very limited view space or running into you because they're fixated on something. Oh and these same people breed little monsters just like them.Now I know why I don't want kids and could go about ten years til my next visit.
2062,2017-07-17,5,"Just go, you won't be sorry. Absolutely worth the price. Adults go after lunch or you will be over run with school groups"
2063,2016-05-20,5,"Price may be a bit high for all the attractions but it is an awesome aquarium, a great learning experience for kids and I'm sure it's very very expense to operate.  I'm thankful to have such a resource in California.  I've probably been 6, now 7 times and look forward to coming again at some point."
2064,2015-12-10,5,"I love the Aquarium!  I bring my baby here all the time and it never gets old.  We have the family membership which comes with 2 guest passes so you can share the experience with family and friends.  They always have really fun events after hours which are open to members and non members alike.  I love the Puffins!  Helpful tip: Octopi are nocturnal, so the only time you'll get to see them in their glory is at the after hour events!!"
2065,2015-10-28,5,"Incredible aquarium. You can spend hours here and on your feet, but they provide free wheelchairs - a nice service that made for a much better experience. All exhibits are fully accessible to wheelchairs. And you can get stamped and come back later that same day - lots of restaurants on Cannary Row so I'd recommend that over the aquarium cafe. Also go on a weekday when it's less crowded."
2066,2015-06-22,5,"So much to see here!!!! $40/pp, but bring a current student ID for a discount. This is at the entrance of cannery row closer to the streets for locals. I don't remember what I saw last time I was there since it's been +10years. I'm very hard to entertain, but this place did it. There were a million kinds of fishes to look at, sharks, turtles, octopus, squid, penguins, eels, puffin, etc. and an Austin Powers kind of room for jellyfishes. There were 2 separate rooms actually. There's even a touch area first and 2nd floors, but they're the same animals. The food area isn't anything to talk about though. Multiple gift shops and so much to look at. I would say 3hrs tops to look at everything. $40 is a bit, but it's definitely worth it to take some out of town folks. Bring your own food if you don't want to buy food there, but beware it's not a big dining area. Cannery row is just a few feet down, but the aquarium is a much better tourist place.My dad is almost 60 and he LOVES this place. My siblings and I kept losing him since he was zooming here and there taking photos of everything. Also said it was the best fathers' day ever :)"
2067,2015-01-02,4,"Be sure to SEA the turtles, they are pretty cool. If you don't like screaming kids/want to avoid crowds, don't go on Fri/Sat/Sun, go on the weekends, or in the early morning. They have a lot of variety of jellyfish...that was cool. The bird exhibits are kinda sad...but there is a neat 'touch' area (touch the sea urchins, touch the seaweed, put your hand in cold water and hope a stingray passes by). The best things to stare at are the large tuna fish in the big tank, and the anchovies in the kelp forest. This aquarium is not too big so it only takes 2-3 hours to get through the entire thing.There is a lot to see/do for children (interactive stuff) and the aquarium is big on environmental awareness so most lessons revolve around conservation."
2068,2016-05-16,5,"Our backyard stay cation starts here!! Walk the rec trail to enjoy the salty air and sights and find the little groups of painted anchovies along the way, the kids get a kick out of it.  Go early and on a week day if possible to go with less of a crowd.  The new Baja area is fantastic and visually stunning! Never have I seen a bed of sea worms!! Outside of that tank I'm sure I don't want to!! Lol. Go explore the best aquarium on the west coast! No lies, Monterey is the most diverse and largest aquarium on this coastline!"
2069,2016-08-03,5,"Every person there, paid or volunteer, eager to help and always with enthusiasm and a smile! I live here and I love to go to the aquarium!"
2070,2015-07-26,5,"This aquarium had the best fish I have ever seen above the ocean, and I saw Finding Nemo! Unfortunately here, I had difficulty finding Nemo, but that was really the only downside of the aquarium. Where else can someone find a huge tank dedicated to open ocean fish? My prized molly, who I have named Molly, pales in comparison to the other fish here. I saw schools of pacific sardines (surprisingly not on the pizza they had there) and huge leopard sharks. They even had a huge kelp forest! It didn't look very green or forestry though, but it looked awesome! Overall this aquarium taught me one major overarching idea. In the eloquent words of my dear friend, Dr. Bruce White, ""Fish are friends, not food"""
2071,2017-07-08,5,Always so much to see and not enough time ! This place is amazing .. Very clean and a lot of volunteers who are very knowledgeable of all aspects
2072,2017-07-06,5,I just bought a season family pass so we could relax and come anytime we wanted to. We are enjoying this very much.
2073,2017-07-06,5,"I moved to Monterey for a year and got a membership which was so worth it. I ended up at the aquarium at least once a month, sometimes just for lunch. My favorite part is looking off the back deck at a variety of species including sea lions, sea otters, whales and dolphins."
2074,2014-07-21,4,"Great place to take the family, been coming here for years. This years visit we noticed the aquarium and cannery row has become a more popular tourist attraction them we have ever experienced in the past. This place is a great place to view local see life.  One thing did concern me was the amount of allergy in the tanks. The tanks looked neglected  and the water had a lot of bio material in it.Over all it's a great place to visit with the family."
2075,2014-06-11,4,This was the second time I've been here and it is nice.  The kids like it.  We watched the penguins for awhile and the big aquarium with the turtle and sun fish.They offer discounts to students.
2076,2016-02-25,5,I haven't been to the Monterey aquarium in years. My recent trip with the family was fabulous. The kids enjoyed it and i did too. They have several feeding times which gets the attention of the people. A lot of different sea creatures. It takes a good 3-4 hours to see the whole thing. They have a children's section which the kids had a blast. There is also and outdoor so that you can get out and get some fresh air. They let you pet certain creatures. I would not mind going again.
2077,2014-07-17,4,"At first I doubted whether to go or not because of the price - it's $40 per adult, $25 per child, and $35 per student, and for 4 of us (2 adults, 1 student, and 1 child) we had to cough up $140... but I am very glad we did go in.This is a big aquarium with lots of amazing exhibits!Must see:Tentacles - octopuses, Squid and Cuttlefishes. Amazing!The Jellies Experience - you will never believe how many different kinds and colors of Jellies are out there! And they glow in light so beautifully. Definitely a must see.Open Sea - this exhibit is great. Here tuna, sharks, sea turtles, and sardines coexist in amazing harmony. Don't miss the Feeding of open sea animals.There are many more things you can do here. We ended up staying at the aquarium for about 4 hours. Excellent experience for kids."
2078,2011-02-17,5,"I came here with my girlfriend. We got there as soon as it opened so it wasn't that crowded but as the day progressed it got packed. That weekend was like Shark's Day or something so there were several Shark related events that I didn't check out.This place is awesome! They have every animal that you could possibly think of. My favorites are the sea otters, sharks, and penguins! SInce my girlfriend loves sea otters thats the first place we checked out. They were throwing ice to them so it was fun watching them catch it and eat it. We also returned during feeding times which was also pretty cool since they do tricks and stuff. I also liked the jellyfish wall! It's blue background just enhances the natural colors of the jellyfish. There are also seahorses, flamingos, kelps, and much more. Also, the touch pools is a must go! You get to touch star fishes, abalone, sea cucumbers, and other weird stuff!Overall, an excellent place to spend a day because there is so much to see and do!"
2079,2015-03-25,5,"I adore aquariums. They're my favorite places on Earth and I could spend the whole day just starting at the wonder that is the ocean. I've always felt an attachment towards marine life and I am thrilled to report that I finally visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium on our way up to San Francisco. Parking is a pain around this area because the aquarium does not have a formal parking lot so you have to street park and it is a very populated street. The aquarium is also a little expensive but if you have a student id, you get a discount so use it! (even if you already graduated like I did). There's two floors of wonder. I saw some things in this aquarium that I thought I would never see. Creatures that I've only seen on television and it was breathtaking.  They have entire schools of fish swimming in these enormous tanks. More importantly, the tanks here actually resemble an actual ocean. There are kelp tanks, wave tanks, and there are so many interactive installation for the kids. There's a schedule of all the feedings that happen all day so make sure you catch one of those times because it is a lot of fun. They also have sea otters! They're very cute and always a lot of fun to watch. It takes about 2 hours to get through the aquarium but that's if you're moving quickly. I would recommend taking out at least 3-4 hours to fully enjoy this aquarium to its full potential. Definitely one of the better aquariums I've ever been to and one that I am already dying to visit again. 5/5"
2080,2016-05-08,5,AMAZING!!! What a mind blowing learning experience! They really worked hard to make sure you enjoy the visit. The exhibits are just gorgeous! I was enchanted by the ocean and all the beautiful creatures. Bike parking at the bus loading area. There's also a big locker box nearby. For $1 (4 quarters) you can store your stuff there. It easily fits my 40-L backpack and another 20-L backpack.
2081,2013-07-31,5,"First of all... Did you know it's possible to sleep at the Monterey Bay Aquarium?! I didn't either until my husband surprised me last weekend. This was such a cool experience.. I went in kinda thinking to myself ""hmm.. There's probably gonna be a bunch of kids running around screaming and won't sleep"" and I was very pleasantly surprised.. All the kids there were super sweet and well behaved! First thing we walked in and they had us put our ""camping gear"" down in a locked room so that we could go around and enjoy the aquarium after being closed to the public, so there was plenty of space to roam around peacefully and enjoy yourself. They had a live band right next to the drinks area (yes they serve alcohol). We got a couple of drinks and walked around to each exhibit, it was so nice. Next they had us gather our camping gear and choose a place to sleep- you can sleep in the jellyfish room or the open sea room. We got an awesome spot to ourselves right in front of the moon jellies. Everyone was very respectful of our things and sleeping area. Next, they had snack time where we got milk and cookies and fruit. After that they have an optional movie in the auditorium or you can hang out or go to sleep, we chose to hang out and just enjoy our view of the jellies. We fell asleep and tossed and turned because we only brought sleeping bags (I recommend bringing some kind of cushion or even blow up bed- lots of people had blow up beds). In the morning they serve you a nice little breakfast. It was just a really enjoyable experience and I'll definitely be recommending my friends and will be back to do it again :)"
2082,2015-10-06,5,"Simply fantastic place to visit. Super cool, clean and you can easily spend a good 3-4 hours exploring various exhibitions.Make sure to buy your tickets online to avoid standing in a long long line. Or, if you are staying in one of the Monterey hotels, ask them if they sell tickets. Sometimes they have deals like buy one ticket, get two days of admission for the price of one."
2083,2014-01-11,4,"I have lived in the Bay Area for so many years now, but had never decided to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium until recently. I was not disappointed. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would! I really enjoy the giant two-story salt-water pool they have. I just like watching the super-tall seaweed sway with the current, as if they were singing along to ""Under the Sea"" from The Little Mermaid. The octopuses are also great fun, especially if you can catch them swimming around. Sea horses are adorable to watch. But my favorite thing is the jelly fish exhibit upstairs (not the ""Jelly Experience"" downstairs). Also, the penguins are also pretty cool.I don't know that I'd ever go back just because of the drive and the cost of admission. But maybe if I was babysitting some kids some day or had some of my own, I do think visiting this place is one of those great intellectually stimulating activities for kids. If you've never been, it really is something to behold."
2084,2016-03-13,4,Great place to visit and learn about the marine sanctuary we were enjoying. Very knowledgable staff and volunteers. Only disappointment was that all the souvenirs were all made in China. Too many local or regional sources to accept that the decision to outsource the production of everything to China was anything other than a deliberate choice to focus on profit over principle.
2085,2016-05-06,5,"Always take my cars to Ricco's shop, gives me great service and very very reasonable price for the work.  Honest and caring business!! Highly recommend this place for your tires and car service"
2086,2011-12-10,5,"How does one even BEGIN to describe, let alone write a review of THE aquarium. This place is amazing. Pricey, for sure. But it really is one of a kind. I love that it has the Monterey Bay's ecosystem as the centerpiece and expands from there. The SeaHorse exhibit is fun, LOVE the jellyfish (never gets old), and the otters are a rare treat. We always enjoy a day at the Aquarium and then visiting Cannery Row afterwards. Short and sweet, go to the Aquarium. It is worth it."
2087,2016-03-11,5,"I have a season pass, and I never get tired of going! I would come everyday if I could drop my dog off on our daily walk and go inside (or, in my dreams, bring her) but this is such a magical place, no one who has a chance to visit should miss it!"
2088,2013-12-08,5,"I love this place.  The otters are so cute...the jellies are out of this world and the penguins were hugging. I took my mother and daughters.  It is quite pricey, but we had free tickets won on a radio station, so really was worth the trip."
2089,2014-07-08,4,Great place for kids. Does get really crowded so I recommend going early or two hours before closing therefore you would be able to see every thing.There are places to eat and stores inside. My kids loved the play area with the slide and the splash zone.  Bring extra clothes because they will get wet.I loved the area with the large glass by the jelly fish exhibit. Felt like we were underwater.Tickets are pricey and lines get long over the weekend. Its best to buy online therefore you can vit through.Great experience. We have been here twice this year.
2090,2011-07-15,5,"This was an amazing aquarium keeping all entertained and interactive!We as a family had some great memories shared while visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium; by far the best part were the gleams and unwavering smiles on my entire family. We couldn't have been more happier spending our time here being a kid again. There really is so much to see, do and learn that you could really spend a good part of your day here. I recommend coming it close to opening and take part in a lot of the daily happenings; feedings, tours, and animal interaction exhibits. A great location on cannery row and a great layout that left your interests piqued in every inch of the space."
2091,2013-06-28,5,Just make sure to get early to find parking. Cool place to spend with family. Kids will love it
2092,2013-08-27,1,"If you don't have kids, then don't go here. Parking is insane during the summer weekends (ended up having to park in the lot of a mexican restaurant blocks away and paying them $15 for it) and had to navigate through the masses of screaming and grimy children the ENTIRE time.Not much to see, not much to do. They were hyping up some sort of show which ended up being a bunch of their employees swinging wooden animal figures on sticks and singing. Fun for kids I assume."
2093,2016-01-04,5,Truly the best place on God's earth. The coastline is amazing. The exhibits are phenomenal. The biologists and facilitators love to share. There is something for everyone. My favorite place to be is right here.
2094,2016-04-12,5,"Been to other aquariums, not too  impressed. This one does it ALL WELL.  They sure know what appeals to kids.  Not just  happy responses but squeals of delight. Well organized, well staffed ( apparently they have more than 1100 volunteers), good signage, engaging presentations, excellent food at the cafeteria, beautiful setting on Monterey Bay, attractive, inviting facility. I liked that they also used texting to keep you informed about unscheduled feedings or sightings. Well done. VERY COOL."
2095,2013-07-25,5,I love this place so much growing up that I actually signed up for a Membership! Oh what?! I never do that!We went here this past weekend w/ the fam and we loved it. The jellies are our favorite offering tons of dif varieties that we didn't know existed! The seahorse exhibit as well as the large tanks were also fun to experience.It was extermely packed (especially for a Monday) so it was difficult to spend too much time on each exhibit especially the feedings so thankfully we can come back as many times as we want (hopefull on a quieter day!). Having a special member entrance as well as discounts on experience make it a little sweeter too being a member =)
2096,2013-07-08,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium has got to be one of the best aquariums in the world.  Yes, it is expensive.  Yes, it is worth it!  There is so much to see here, and you do not have to be a child in order to enjoy the place.  My wife and I spent about 6 hours here.  I think the best time to go is right when they open.  That way there is more to do in the afternoon.  First thing, I'd do is get lunch after visiting the aquarium.  There is food here, but it's not so great.  Better choices outside the aquarium.  So have a big breakfast before coming here.Although, we tend to spend many hours here...most people could spend just a few hours here and be just as happy.  Wifey and I tend to take our time more than others do.  Check it out!  It's not just for kids."
2097,2011-06-01,5,"Wow, this place was amazing- ranked amongst the best in my opinion.  Sure, the size is not on the scale of Baltimore National Aquarium- tons of dolphin shows, 3-D theatres, etc.  However, this is great in comparison to other moderate sized ones like Mystic Aquarium.  ATTRACTIONSAmong my favorites are the huge kelp forest, tidal pool, touch tank (cool to touch and feel sea cucumbers- yummy), jellyfish, cute sea otters, and seahorses.* Kelp Forest- we watched a short live show with a docent with the scuba diver who took questions while inside the forest* Tidal Pool- we got to see the creatures below while crouched underneath* Touch tank- great staff to explain about the crabs, sea cucumbers, and star fish* Sea otters- get to see staff feeding them and swim around* Jellies- great exhibit with them in the dark glowing* Sea horses- the highlight with seeing a male seahorse giving birthPARKINGIt can get pricey and parking meters are a pain in the butt to feed every hour.  Just park at the top at the Canning Factory for $5 the whole day and no worries."
2098,2015-12-26,5,"A giant of an aquarium, this place has it all. Otters feeding, realistic recreations of waves crashing onto the shoreline, thousands if not millions of jellyfish and a great outdoors area."
2099,2013-08-21,5,"Sometimes you go to Monterey expecting a bunch of otters to be flailing about, acting cute in the water, eating shellfish off their stomachs (which looks considerably less cute when I attempt it at seafood restaurants) and then you get there, and they're nowhere to be found. And you're like ""HEY YOU MUTHAF****G OTTERS, COME OUT AND ROLL AROUND AND SHIT ALREADY!"" But alas, all your shouting just makes you look like a constipated yeti to the otters, who are kind of snobs if you ask me, and they just refuse to come out and play. That's when you say screw it to those guys and head over to the Monterey Aquarium. Not only do they have an abundance of otters in CAPTIVITY, they are behind glass - yes, sweet see through glass walls, where they have no means of escaping from your otter-soul shriveling stares. They can't even avoid you while you annoyingly hold up a stuffed otter in one hand and a corn dog in the other, while tauntingly waving the plushtoy in their general direction and making unspecific chittering noises, as if they're supposed to believe one of their own somehow got free and are now hanging out with you in the Aquarium cafeteria, mocking them. Not only are there otters, but there is a gorgeous jellyfish exhibit, and though I would not recommend this, I always have the overwhelming desire to creepily stick my face against the glass, just to see them as closely as possible at eyeball level. Also, among their many amazing creatures (seahorses, hammerhead sharks, an obese sunfish - although the last time I went it was dead and I think they replaced it since then) they have a Wolf Eel. Not only does the name sound cool, it also looks like some terrifying mythical creature of the ocean - the Demonic Flail of Neptune. The Squatch of the Seas. Anyway, if you're not Jacques Cousteau or Stephen Zissou, it's definitely worth the price of admission to come see this wondrous, jam packed aquarium. Just be prepared to crave sushi when you're done."
2100,2013-05-10,5,"This aquarium is absolutely amazing. There are two gigantic wings and three levels of quality exhibits. You can easily spend an entire morning or afternoon here between the live lectures, feedings and numerous exhibits. The space is beautifully laid out with plenty of interactive and educational activities for the kids. The jellyfish exhibit is mind blowing and worth the price of admission alone. There are two restaurants on site and the gift shop has everything you would want. Yeah, the price is a little steep but you really do get your money's worth. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of those places that makes you want to be a kid again."
2101,2015-12-22,5,Simply one of the best aquariums in the world. I could spend hours in front of the large tank with their hammerheads turtles and yellowfin tunas.
2102,2014-04-07,5,"This place is great! Went yesterday for 'kids get in free' day. Pretty crowded, we had to wait almost an hour to get in the doors, but thats likely because of the free kids admission. The kids loved it, all the awesome exhibits kept them interested the entire time. The staff is right there to teach you all these fun facts about each critter in the touch pool area, and if you time it right you can even watch a feeding! Highly recommended for a family outing!"
2103,2014-03-03,4,"Went here yesterday with my family. 3 kids ages 12, 9 & 8. It was ny daughter's first time, my son had been once before. The aquarium is nice and it wasn't super busy which made it more enjoyable. The sea life is always interesting. The only thing I missed was seeing the otters more. They weren't coming out much. Tickets are a little pricey adults $39.99 & kids under 10 $24.99. I did notice there wasn't a place to pet the sting rays anymore but maybe they took that exhibit out for some reason. Overall good experience"
2104,2017-06-19,5,"Excellent place to bring your children, however the cost is high. There is so much to see and sometimes there are programs to attend."
2105,2015-09-05,4,"My husband, 14 mo old and I went here yesterday and spent about 1.5 hours. I am shocked at the admission price and was definitely glad that we had been given tickets from some friends. The aquarium is nice and has quite a bit for toddlers and older kids to do, see and touch, but as adults going alone or with babies too young to appreciate all it has to offer $40 is a steep price IMO. There are some nice exhibits to look at, my favorite being the jellies, and certainly being right on the water with plenty of outdoor areas to walk and sit is a huge bonus. But compared to the Chicago or Atlanta aquarium, I wasn't blown away like I was expecting from all the glowing 5 star reviews. Was it a nice, fun 1.5 hours? Yes. Would it be worth $80 admission and more for lunch for 2 adults again? Probably not."
2106,2014-02-27,4,"I know people love this place and it is amazing. Why is this not 5 stars?  But we came with our friend Wing and a total of four kids under 5 over a long weekend (Presidents Day) and it was packed. I could barely see any sea life and I was getting really hot and sweaty trying to fight my way in with my two little kids.Our friends had membership and let us in with that, so we are grateful for the lowered admission cost. But I had paid full price for this experience on a long weekend, it is probably not worth it. Probably best to come during the weekdays if possible or avoid long weekends."
2107,2014-06-15,5,"well, the best aquarium I've ever been to. A lot of fond memories of our little kid and us playing there over the years.  They've managed to make the difficult task of keeping jellies seem so easy.  The jelly displays are just beautiful there.  If I ever had any complaints, it's probably that the touch bat ray and leopard shark tank is too deep for short arms.  And, Monterey is a nice and touristy town and that certainly helps too."
2108,2014-06-13,4,"One of the BEST aquariums I have been to. While it wasnt as large as I expected it I be, it did offer a great array of marine life. The seep sea exhibit was my favorite, and sunfish was by far the most interesting fish I have ever seen.  Worth stopping by if your in the area!"
2109,2011-01-31,5,"I love it here!!It's so amazing watching beautiful (and sometimes not so beautiful) creatures zip and/or float in the water.  However, the crowd of loud children is always annoying... but what can you do?The food is good too!  We ate at the restaurant, yummy.  IOyster Po'Boy: deep fried oyster goodness!  I was also a huge fan of the french fries.  Fish & Chips: Hell yes... the fish was breaded and fried to perfection!Overall:Love it, going to come back (of course), and not going to get the clam chowder again..."
2110,2013-02-15,5,"There's nothing more magical than entering and being enchanted with high ceiling to floor glass, holding in dancing seaweed, beautiful composition of marine life, and occasionally a courteous diver or two. It's as though you are swimming amongst the sea life and not outside.This has been my favorite aquarium from the mid-of-the-States to the West Coast. You can literally spent hours upon hours at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Every exhibit is breath-taking. Worth every single penny, gallon of gas, and hour on the road."
2111,2016-04-01,5,"When my kids found out about this place, we decided to head down and WOW were we blown away. Since our initial visit we are now members and enjoy our family trips to the Aquarium."
2112,2013-02-17,5,"When visiting the aquarium, regardless of age, a sense of awe comes over you. I went a few days ago, probably my 15th time over the last few decades and I'm still wowed by something. The creators of exhibits push the envelope all of the time and they come up with new and exciting special exhibits, or brush up the ""keepers"" so they always seem new and up to date.This visit I noticed the new interactive plankton exhibit in the Deep Sea portion, the psychedelic new jelly area and appreciated the art made of recycled products. As always I spent some time relaxing on a bench in the Deep Sea and bottom floor part of the Kelp Forest. With the music played that sounds like you are in Massage Envy, I always find my visit very relaxing. Although sometimes I feel like I should bring a masseuse to the Deep Sea area, jump on a table and have a perfect massage!As timing would have it, I was able to experience the Whales to Windmills ""movie"" which I found absolutely fascinatingly the woman who narrated the pictures was energetic, informative and obviously enjoyed the subject. I recommend people to watch it as it focused on bio-mimicry, I promise it's more interesting than it sounds!In regards to the incredible amount of children, the easiest fix would be for parents to teach there kids not to push people to get to see something to teach them the concept of letting people have their personal space. Another option is to have an adult only hours like they did back in the day at swimming pools. I find that when I visit on a Weekday after 2pm, it's pretty quiet, so there is a tip for you!"
2113,2014-02-18,5,"What's not to love about this place? Truly spectacular for people of all ages. --- Expect longer ticketing lines on weekends and holidays (over President's Day, we waited to purchase our tickets in a 15 min line). This would be one of the many advantages of purchasing a membership.--- You are given a map of the layout and a 'Today at the Aquarium' paper which details the events, feeding times, happening so you won't miss a thing.--- There are so many areas which you can explore for hours on end. DO NOT MISS 'The Open Sea' (the largest tank which features many varieties of tuna, shark, turtle, fish schools, etc). We also enjoyed the 'Monterey Bay Habitats' which, as the name suggests, features local fish and wildlife in a gorgeous habitat.--- There is a nice cafe (which even serves beer and wine along with coffee and pastries) for a pick-me-up... we took advantage of this! There is also a cafeteria which looked quite nice.---- Several giftshops throughout make it a nice place to spend the day and do some gift shopping. Of course they have to-be-expected souvenirs and kids' things, but the main giftshop has lovely home and jewelry collections as well."
2114,2016-04-17,5,"My husband and I went to the aquarium on a Saturday, I suggest going as soon as they open to avoid some of the crowds. We bought or tickets in advance which I highly suggest! We waited in the will call line to get ours and some of the people in the ticket line had already been at the door for an hour.  We did two tours while at the aquarium.  The behind the scenes, and the jelly fish tour. I recommend both. At the end of the jellies tour you do get to touch the jelly fish. The behind the scenes tour allows you to get better pictures of the animals in the enclosures."
2115,2015-09-14,5,"Yeah, this place is pretty freaking awesome. The Kelp Forest was my favorite because you could see in it from three different levels. The Open Sea was my girlfriend's top choice because of the huge schools of fish and large variety of them, but really, everything is fantastic. Grab a visitor's map, and see if you can catch all the feedings for the different areas because it is pretty mesmerizing to watch these huge schools of fish go after food. This means you'll have to get there when it opens at 10am, but why wouldn't you want to stay for a day? There are huge tanks of jelly fish, perch, rockfish, sharks, and everything in between. You can touch different forms of kelp, crabs, rays, and fish. Penguins, puffins, and sea otters are jumping in and out of pools, and they even bring in an albatross to educate people on other forms of marine life. I can honestly spend all day here, especially if it's with my girlfriend. Regular admission is about $40, but if you have a student ID, it's $35. Really great deal. And the special exhibit of Tentacles and Vanishing Wildlife is pretty awesome. I love how informative this place is on everything."
2116,2015-03-19,5,"Really a great place that's worth every penny. If you visit, I would absolutely recommend following the feedings in each exhibit (especially the Open Sea Exhibit and Kelp Forest). Also, the Sea Otter Tour was very cool and informative. The views from the aquarium are amazing, and the food in the court is surprisingly delicious (and unsurprisingly expensive). We stayed from the aquarium's open to close (10am-5pm), and were continuously surprised and excited in each exhibit. The sea otters were absolutely amazing as always. All of the staff were extremely knowledgeable about marine life, and never gave BS answers. It's truly amazing how much they support and educate the groups in marine conservation and sustainable seafood habits. You need to visit this aquarium. I cannot stress enough: follow the feeding schedules for the Open Sea Exhibit and the Kelp Forest. You won't regret it."
2117,2013-08-04,5,"I've been dying to come back here for years.  It was a magical place when I was 9, and I have recently confirmed it hasn't lost it luster since.  I highly recommend purchasing your tickets before hand to avoid the long lines (also take note what discounts listed on their website you can take advantage of.)  Don't be deceived: the line doesn't look so bad as you're coming upon the entrance, but the line weaves around behind the building what only in Disneyland would be consider as short.  Parking is very expensive around the area.  So we parked at a 4-hour meter on the opposite side of Cannery Row.  Although I could have spent the whole day in the aquarium, 4 hours is plenty.I downloaded their iphone app before arriving, but I completely forgot I even had it once there.  I'm guessing it could have helped us navigate around the aquarium, and ensure that we didn't miss an exhibit. Every tank was mesmerizing.  The views from the observation deck are breath-taking.  The sea-otters and penguins were not only cute, but very entertaining.I think I would prefer to go by myself next time.  It's difficult to go in large groups because everyone has their own interests and goes at different paces.  I can sit in front of different tanks for hours.  If I lived closer, I would definitely be a member and visit more frequently."
2118,2017-06-07,3,"Kinda cool but for the price it's nowhere near worth it. Not a ton of interaction and for it being ""world known"" it didn't have the greatest of attraction and by that rare of species on display. But if you've got some time to kill, reading all the info on the signs may be cool?"
2119,2016-06-06,4,"The diver area was great!! so much fun. All the aquariums are clean, however the walking areas are dirty with trash. People do not seem to know how to hit the trash can. Not a lot of employees or help cleaning the common areas. Overall my family and I had a GREAT time!E."
2120,2016-06-06,5,"Absolutely fantastic experience for people of all ages the most extensive collection of marine life in one location I have seen by far. The open sea exhibit was mind blowing and can not be described, it just must be seen. It you know any sea lovers you should strongly suggest this to them. Also near multiple great breakfast places."
2121,2013-08-17,5,"Thanks, Monterey Aquarium. Because of you, there is no point in visiting any other aquarium, ever. The sea horse exhibit was fascinating, the otters and penguins were adorable, but our favorite by far was the jellyfish. Imagine being in a room full of living lava lamps. And at the Open Ocean exhibit, if you stand right up to the glass, watching these impossible huge fish and sharks glide by, you actually experience vertigo.The aquarium is very kid-friendly. There are a number of places where the kids can pet star fish and hold hermit crabs and other coastal critters.One drawback, though not on the part of the aquarium, is parking. We found one lot on Cannery Row that charged $10, but demanded cash (Cash? What's cash?)  up front. We ended up parking at a valet lot on Wave St., a block east, for $24."
2122,2013-07-21,3,3.5 Kinda crowded and slightly better than the aquarium of the pacific in long beach in terms of overall exhibits and size.You could spend a good 2 hours here but I did not appreciate the crazy loud kids running freely here. $3 off with student ID but its $35 regular price which is kinda pricey. Really informative and you can touch some of the sea life although I didnt see any jellyfish you can touch like you can at the aquarium of the pacific. I think for me this will be a more of a one time thing as I actually enjoyed my time at the aquarium of the pacific more. Maybe if you go right at opening you can avoid some the crazy crowds. Parking around the area is just as expensive as SF unfortunately ($2-3 hour in quarters or credit card).Cannery row is like a tourist trap street so you can stroll along for shopping and food before and afterwards.
2123,2013-12-05,5,"Jellies, and Otters, and Tuna oh my!Those are my three favorite exhibits at the aquarium. Make sure to be there at a time when they are feeding the fish or otters."
2124,2013-12-27,4,"The exhibits are amazing and beautiful, but the crowds are almost intolerable. Strollers and little kids touching me. Plus there was that lady who had to take pictures of everything in each tank. This is no place for agoraphobics, people with anger issues, impatient people and claustrophobics. I'd hate to be here in the summer.Buy your tickets online. They're good for a year. And call and find out when it's the best time to come!"
2125,2011-07-05,5,"So amazing even 14yrs later! I hadn't been here since I did marine biology programs a couple summers at UCSC and everything is as amazing as I remembered as a kid. It was a super nostalgic visit and I'm so glad it lived up to what I remembered. Things haven't gotten run down with time, everything was spotless.I love that their focus is mainly on the local marine life instead of filling it with random tropical fish. There are tons of interactive exhibits for kids, and you could see the excitement on their faces as they peered into each tank. Hopefully it'll make the same impression on them as it had on me. I felt like a little kid running around to see everything. I'm of course in love with the otters. I was lucky that they were in the water and playing with each other. The baby was out and playing with a rubber dog toy. Love it! I think my favs have to be the jellyfish because their flow and the lighting is eerie and magical. They've expanded it from what I remember. Another is the circular tank in the ceiling. I think those were anchovies? The tank itself is beautiful, add the blue lighting reflecting off the shimmering fish as they swim in an endless circle... perfect. Although it is a little sad - wonder what they're thinking? The million gallon tank is incredible. I was bummed the mola molas were hiding out in the back. I could barely see them. They also don't have the little great white shark anymore, but guess they don't live forever. Still feels like watching a scene from finding nemo. I've been lucky enough to go behind the scenes to see the tank from above. Its completely different seeing from that perspective, amazing what they can do with glass and lighting. The $30 admission is a little steep, but definitely worth every penny. I enjoyed Monterey Bay so much more than the dolphins and whales doing tricks at seaworld."
2126,2015-07-22,5,"We just Loved this Experience! We took the free trolley from The Marriott Hotel, had made arrangements and purchased tickets, so we walked a few yards...short line to Will Call..and we were in! This place has always been Amazing! Still is! Lot of people, but well managed with guides all over both buildings! Seating to rest..great Cafe, and Eatery to have a great lunch, Tide Pool exhibit, it is just a great experience!I recommend you check their website before you arrive there...purchase tickets, and make reservations for any tours....and find out show times. There are escalators..stairs..and an elevator.  Everything is very accessible.  When your done..step out and you are on Cannery Row!Enjoy!"
2127,2011-02-06,3,"Seahorse porn?  CHECK.  Being cluster-effed in every stuffy, tight, dark corridor?  CHECK.  Middle-aged woman with acromegaly blocking an entire sea otter viewing window?  CHECK CHECK.Oh boy buying tickets for this place should come with a PTSD therapy package because you will need one after an afternoon at this place.  Apparently one of the best aquariums on the west coast has been re-purposed as a chuck-e-cheese day care.  Despite this, it was still a fantastic experience - beautiful specimens, stimulating exhibits, and yes, seahorse porn, although granted it was part of a progression through their life cycle.  Just be careful of crowds.  Angry, grumpy, crowds who despite being over 6'3"" don't feel it's necessary to not stand in a way that blocks the majority of the viewing window for the sea otter feeding.  The gift shop was having a ridiculous sale, so that was awesome.  Just felt like sharing that."
2128,2012-01-23,5,"Love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! It's a great time no matter how old you are.The usual problems with such places: can get crowded, problems finding parking, etc etc."
2129,2013-07-06,4,"Amazing aquarium. Admission prices are kinda steep ($34.95 per adult or $31.95 for college students-w/ valid ID) but I'm sure all the fish-lovers would think otherwise. Lots of colorful fishes with kids running around. It's almost like the kids are on exhibit too-they weave in and out, excitment cries from left to right, and happy parents running after their little ones.The entire aquarium took us about 3-4 hours to complete so not too big if you'd just like to stop by for an afternoon. If you come with kids, then I could easily see this trip taking around ~6 hrs before your kids knock out from exhaustion.  Great trip if you've never been here before but I think I could go without another visit for another 5 years since I'm not sure how often the exhibits change."
2130,2016-03-15,5,"If you love the ocean and all its critters, this spot will be the highlight of your trip to Monterey. Great for the whole family, from the little ones to the elders. Plenty of hands-on interactives for the kids, dreamy passages through the jellies, even otters and puffins! Plan on spending the day and enjoy the intertidal zone off the cafe."
2131,2016-04-28,5,Amazing aquarium with really knowledgable staff! They promote conservation and healthy seafood in the Monterey bay as well.
2132,2013-10-05,4,Great place to take the kids! We planned on spending the entire day but really only needed half a day to see everything. The jellyfish were the best exhibit! The lighting is fantastic and really highlight these amazing creatures.  Overall good experience
2133,2016-04-27,5,"I took the kids here one Friday.  It was great!  Especially the amount of people on a Friday is way better than a weekend!!!  The layout of the place is awesome!  If you haven't been, you need to go at least once."
2134,2015-05-28,1,"Luckily we got a free guest pass to visit here...if we had to pay full admission, I would of been mad.  Steinhart in SF is way better.  This place was boring..same stuff in each room.  We left in an hour"
2135,2016-04-26,4,"This aquarium is veery awesome. I came back in February for my anniversary and wow- I would not want to go any other place. Next time, though, I probably will come on a weekday as I'm not too big into crowds and feel clostrophobic. But the animals were such a joy, and the food is decent!"
2136,2016-04-01,5,"Delightful experience every time my wife and I go from the high quality exhibits to the very courteous staff, highly recommended."
2137,2016-03-12,5,Awesome experience and so beautiful as well as educational.
2138,2013-10-30,4,"I really enjoyed my visit, but unfortunately I came here during labor day weekend, and the aquarium was extremely, extremely crowded. The line outside for a ticket was also 1 hr long if you didn't pre-purchase your tickets online - I highly recommend doing so, and saving time.They have the most comprehensive set of exhibits - penguins, sea otters, octopus, shark, sea turtles, and even birds. They have it all. They also have special exhibits of seahorses and jellyfish, so you can see more variety and species. They also have ""shows"" throughout day, and animal feedings. The shows were handled really well, and started on time. I didn't like how crowded it was though... I saw too many incidents of parents chastising kids or kids throwing tantrums. Maybe it's better on a different weekend. I would actually recommend kayaking in Monterey instead if you really want to get up and close with the animals."
2139,2015-04-26,5,"First things first, going to aquariums is one of my favorite things to do. So everywhere I go, I try to see the local sea life on display. This is an all-around amazing aquarium but the thing that really sells me on this place is the fact that they have a web cam that streams all of the activity going on in the aquarium so that you can see from the comfort of your home! My favorite of their live animal webcams is the aviary section - watching those cute little birds is just the coolest thing. Made the mistake of showing my co-workers and now barely any work gets done (haha, just kidding!) but seriously, check this place out if you're in town and even if you aren't, check out the live stream web cams and it's just like you're right there! Very fun."
2140,2015-03-27,4,Way too many people disrespectful by taking way too many photos using flash on camera phones. Taking too many selfies and generally being selfish about time in front of exhibits preventing the little people from getting up front because they feel they have to take several photos of each exhibit . Staff needs to be a bit more forceful in making adults follow the rules.
2141,2016-02-14,3,"The Aquarium has sure grown since I was last here 14 years ago but I still think it is crazily overpriced.  We came on a summer weekday but it was so crowded it was hard to see some of the windows, especially my kids who can't see over other people.  We were done within a couple hours."
2142,2016-05-24,3,"My husband and I were disappointed especially given the cost. They definitely need more detailed write-ups about the different displays. It just seemed to be more directed at school-aged kids, rather than adults. While we did enjoy watching the penguin and sea otter feedings, it seemed to be lacking something more. I suppose it is good for the city size though."
2143,2013-07-13,5,"This is a world class museum experience, just wonderful no matter how many people are there. Currently there is a facsinating ""jellies"" (jelly fish) exhibit, as well as ""The Open Ocean"" with is a huge window into the bay and its inhabitants. Sharks, hammerheads, rays, tuna, various other fish actively move and glide past you.The jelly fish exhibit is only open through mid-September so definitely go this summer if you can. A wonderful place for the whole family. Currently on weekends they are open into the evening and have live Jazz music and free wine tasting in the lower level. It was just delightful, very much recommended the next time you are in Monterey."
2144,2017-04-22,5,"If you're in Monterey  I have only one thing to say ""go"" . The aquarium is wonderful. I've been to several aquariums this is clearly one of the best in the country . If you have the time  spend the money and take one of the 5 behind the scenes tour . Obviously children love the aquarium but for those of you who don't like the overcrowding and all the kids running around I highly suggest staying later in the day as the aquarium things out you can see more and less noisy."
2145,2011-09-24,4,"Ah yes! It has been approximately 13 years since I've been to this aquarium. And I have ended the hiatus by visiting yesterday with the bf. To start, the main parking for the aquarium is way too pricey. It's a pay machine where you type in the parking slot you've parked in, slide your card (or pay cash) into the meter, and then grab the permit to place on the dash of your car. From what I saw, it's $15 dollars for the whole day and $5 after 4PM. Anyway, we entered and since we had advanced-purchased tickets, we followed the signs that pointed to the right of the lobby. This led us to the main attraction. Confused, we looked around until a man asked us if we needed help. We told him about our tickets, when he led us to the podium we PASSED BY just to stamp our tickets. We could have just gone in for free because the employee was not guarding his post. Oh wellz. Our first stop was to the otters! However, they decided ""eff it, let's just sit here and eat in this big lump of otters"". Cute, nonetheless, but sad. :[ We headed west of the otters where we saw the huge glass walls of fish. Everything seemed well organized. We walked past some of the sea-life touching areas. I felt the people who worked there really knew their stuff and appreciated their knowledge on such a vast topic. Each exhibit was awesome. The small schools of fish to the sea turtles to the puffins to the penguins to the kelp to the tuna to the sunfish. And OH the ocean sunfish! They intrigued me the most. I swear, I could have spent the whole day at the open sea exhibit. We also went to see two of the scheduled shows:- the first one about the deep sea- the second on inventions and the ideas taken from natureThey were both quite interesting and the visuals really made the show. I always thought the aquarium was bigger when I was younger, but we finished exploring everything in under 4 hours. We finished earlier than I thought and I bought a mini otter and hammerhead shark at the store as cute little souvenirs! Wish I'd gone during the special otter days."
2146,2013-02-21,4,Walking through the spot I could only imagine it being a natural evolution and extension of Doc's marine and wildlife supply company from Cannery Row.Cool aquarium and I loved the disco jellies.
2147,2013-10-21,4,"No sea otters at the moment, but from the aquarium, we were able to spot one out on sea"
2148,2017-04-20,5,Really cool place that is very informative on the ocean/sea life. Great for kids. Would recommend for any age though.
2149,2016-05-21,5,"The aquarium is fun for the whole family! I enjoyed it just as much as the kids. There is so much to learn about, and the animals are beautiful. The way the aquarium set up the exhibits are really cool. For instance, one room is circular, and the ceiling is full of fish swimming in unison. The jelly fish are illuminated in dark hallways, and there are several different areas different types of sea life. There are interactive tools for kids, and a pretend diner where they can learn about the dangers of eating swordfish. Our favorite was a toddler based area for playing. It was like a mini playground/discovery museum (located on the second floor). Outside, you're able to look out binoculars to see the whales and wildlife off the coast. There is also a wave simulator the kids go crazy for. If you want to, you can pet sea creatures in tanks (we skipped that feature) or watch the shows scheduled that day. There is also a tour of machines used for canning. Overall, it's an amazing place to visit! Be aware parking is $15 extra. Take a walk through cannery row too, the town is really cute.There is a cafe directly inside and dining off the pier. There are also gift shops located throughout the aquarium."
2150,2012-01-01,5,"I have the best memories of this aquarium!To start off, Monterey is just beautiful!  It is fairly easy to get to the aquarium and I think it's well worth the price of admission to see everything that they have to offer.I remember coming here for school field trips and family outings.  Most recently, I went with some friends to share the wonder.  :)  I can't say enough about the staff!  They were great when we brought my mom, whom was wheelchair bound.  It was one of the last trips we took with her and it couldn't have been more memorable.  They escorted us in past the line and throughout the day, helped us to make sure that she had the best experience.  She was able to get her mind off the pain for an entire day, which was a miracle!  It didn't end there, several months later, I went with my friends again and still had a great experience.  There's so much to see and do there, that you can just barely fit it into a whole day.I recommend getting a membership because you'll probably end up wanting to go again and it's good for a whole year.  You save a lot and you'll support the aquarium.  It's tax deductible too!Food inside the place is super expensive.  You cold bring your own meals or walk further away from the aquarium to get cheaper food.  The restaurants on the same strip of street tend to be pricey too.  There are fast food places and markets near the freeway going towards the aquarium too.Be sure to wear your comfy shoes and layers because it gets cold FAST there!  There is a mall across the street if you end up needing to buy another layer or something else while you are there.It can be a little difficult getting around if you have someone that is in a wheelchair but it is doable.  We were still able to see everything.  They have wheelchairs there as well but I think it's first come, first serve, so you have to get there early if you need one. Very family friendly but be warned, it is a massive place and on weekends, there tends to be huge crowds.  Make sure to designate a meeting point and maybe tie the little ones to you in some way.Anyway, 10 stars if I could give it!  :D  LOVE this place!!!"
2151,2015-12-30,5,Monterey Bay Aquarium is a favorite. We purchased a membership so that we could go twice and support the aquarium.
2152,2016-03-04,5,Definitely the place to take visitors to our area.  I'm always sure to visit the jellies for much of my time.
2153,2016-01-31,4,Great place for kids to be introduced and learn a bit about the sea life and how to protect it. Saw everything in 2 hours. With little kids you could spend quite a bit more time since there are plenty of places to play.
2154,2016-04-17,5,We love this place. We are members from SLO county so we try and get here at least once a month. Our little girl has been coming with us since she was only a couple months old. My favorite part is seeing her experience and love new pets of the aq with each visit. I hope the Monterey Bay AQ will hold a special place in her hear.
2155,2011-06-11,5,"I love love love love love this place!! I remember coming here on those rare special occasions when I was a child.  As a student, they offered a discounted price for $28.  But I decided to do the membership, $90 for two students because I am so so in love with this place, and hey the money goes to a good cause! During lunch time, I remember constantly saying ""I'm so excited to visit the aquarium! I'm so excited.""  Having such high expectations of this place, I was very surprised that the aquarium exceeded those super high expectations! There were so many things to see - the aquarium is huge.  After discovering that the biggest tank was closed, I was extremely glad that I had purchased the membership.  Despite the biggest attraction being closed, they had filled that void with many other things - like the flamingos! It was pretty cool seeing flamingos in an aquarium.We also had the privilege to stumble upon the feeding of the tiger sharks and school of fish in the big tank when you first walk in, so we stood there for a while watching the crowd converse with the diver inside the tank feeding the fishes.  That definitely added to the experience."
2156,2013-06-18,5,"State of the art aquarium!You can literally spend a whole day here. Everything is so beautiful and so well kept.Located at the end of Cannery Row so after you spend some time at the aquarium, you can head down and walk around the row - grad some grub, ghiradelli chocolate, caramel covered apples etc. On the other side of the aquarium there is Lover's point and a scenic walk down there. A MUST.I did the Behind the Scenes tour and it was pretty awesome. It starts an hour before the aquarium opens to the public and you go around with a small group of people to pet different kinds of sea creatures, make the penguin's food, feed the fishes, etc. You even get to stay at the aquarium for the rest of the day for free. Definitely a lot of fun!The aquarium has a lot of cool tours and adventures so make sure to look at their website for more info.If you hit up the MWR at Presidio of Monterey, they offer discounted prices for military personnel. Some days like the 4th of July, Memorial Day etc are free for military but don't quote me on that. I went on two of those free for military days and it worked out fine but I heard they are locking down on that. Call them to see if they still do."
2157,2011-09-11,4,I LOVE IT!! Student price is $27.95I would definetely come again and spend more time reading..I came during the weekend and it was PACKED.. In the morning it wasn't as crowded so i like it.. but afternoon.. it was crowded.. So I couldn't look at everythign in detail as i wanted..
2158,2016-03-21,4,Beautiful! Brought my 3 kids here we had a blast and it's very informative and educational.  Adults and children alike learn and appreciate the beauty of the ocean and all life therein :)
2159,2015-11-18,5,"I never get tired of this place! I could sit and watch the sea otters and penguins all day. They do interactive feeds in these tanks which kids love. It's gotten a bit pricey ($40 per adult for the day) but it can't be beat! Wish they had kept the huge jelly fish exhibit which was a highlight over the past few years. New tentacles exhibit lacks actual animals but looks like it has a bunch of interactive stuff for younger visitors. Beware though, this place gets packed especially on the weekends!"
2160,2016-03-18,5,I've visited the MA several times over last 25 years and it just keeps getting better.. Fantastic jellyfish exhibit and several activities my granddaughter would enjoy... I hope to bring her here for a visit soon... Highly recommended stop if you are planning a west coast visit..
2161,2015-06-26,5,"Amazing exhibits. I really enjoyed the kelp forest and the open ocean exhibits. The sea otters are my favorite, so cute! Love how they are so involved with CSUMB. A little crowded but not bad if you come on a weekday afternoon."
2162,2011-10-21,5,"This is my 2nd time visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium! I'm always at aweeee when I come here! It's easy to navigate and there's so much to see here. I love the jelly fish exhibit. Surprisingly, it wasn't packed on a Saturday that we came here.Great educational place in Monterey!"
2163,2013-11-10,5,"This review is several months overdue. My boyfriend and I went to Monterey in March, and I'm just now getting around to reviewing some of the places we visited. Oops.I had been ridiculously excited to see this place for a long time. When my boyfriend and I decided to take a quick trip down to Monterey, I insisted on us going. I wasn't sure if he would enjoy it as much as I thought I would, but honestly, I don't think I cared that much =P. Bad, selfish me.We weren't the biggest fans of the admissions price at first, but since I still had a student ID, I managed to get a discount off my ticket. Since my boyfriend has never bothered to get a student ID, we had to pay full price for him. Hah.I was also disappointed to find out that the otter exhibit was closed. My bad for not checking this, but we only had that weekend to go anyways, so it's not like we wouldn't have gone had we known. I believe it has re-opened since.So...I knew I would love the aquarium, but I didn't realize how much my boyfriend would love it too! We had fun taking pictures of the animals, reading all the random factoids, and playing with the interactive exhibits. We also got to observe two of the penguins have some....fun...with each other. That was quite strange.Our favorite was the jellyfish, hands down. So very pretty!There are a few observation decks that offer absolutely stunning views of Monterey Bay. You may want to bundle up though, as it can get rather windy out there!All in all, we were super glad we visited. Definitely a fun place for all ages to spend an afternoon! I'm now pregnant with our first child, and we can't wait to take our little girl here for a visit!"
2164,2016-05-31,5,"Love the Aquarium! My daughter was fascinated with all the exhibits, great place to go with family and friends."
2165,2011-02-24,5,"As far as Aquariums go this place is amazing.As far as anything goes, this place is still pretty dang awesome.There are loads of unique things to see and the exhibits are first rate.  Everything in here is designed for maximum viewing, tactile experiences, and learning.  Nothing in here disappoints.The Jellyfish exhibit is as awesome as it appears in all those countless photos people see before they actually visit.  Actually, I would say it is more awesome.Crowds can get intense, so the best time to come is when other people aren't.  When is that?  Well, the crowds thin out at the end of the day (probably not when you want to start your first visit though) and are lower on weekdays.  But even with lots of people the experience is not diminished.If you like aquariums and you haven't been here yet... why?If you like doing things and you haven't been here yet, visit and it will not disappoint."
2166,2017-05-30,5,"Superb exhibits and staff, combined with a new and more combative tone about the value and relevance of science, made this last visit yet another in a long line of 5-star experiences at this exquisite museum."
2167,2014-02-17,5,"First time being here since I was a child. Parking is expensive and off-site. Besides that, the aquarium is huge and there is so many amazing things to see. The new psychedelic jelly fish exhibit is really fun. I recommend you see the shark presentation in the auditorium. Also, eat at the restaurant and not the cafe is you're willing to spend a few dollars. The food was so so good and we didn't have to wait in line. Our view was of the bay with a sea otter swimming right in front of us. They provide you with binoculars so you can see the wildlife. All in all it's a must see experience."
2168,2013-08-27,4,"Very, very cool. Very family friendly. My 10 month old even seemed to really enjoy everything there was to see. There was so much to experience, it was one of those things that we didn't end up even spending very much time at the last couple exhibits because we were so tired. We could have spent all day here and really gotten our money's worth if we had the energy!"
2169,2013-08-25,5,"Loved this place because of the various large tanks they have. Hammer head sharks, sea otters, salmon, jelly fish,very  large sea turtles oh my!!"
2170,2012-12-30,4,"I like the Monterey Bay Aquarium a lot. I would LOVE it if it had adult-only hours. Oh, not very many -- maybe an hour before opening (8:30-9:30) or after closing (7-8pm). The aquarium, minus the screaming / squealing / sticky-fingered / jostling hordes of children (and their double-wide strollers), would be amazing. I would love to linger by a tank and observe the gentle pulsing of the jellies in silence, or actually have enough time and space to sketch. Don't get me wrong; I think the aquarium does a good job of educating kids about how cool marine organisms are and why we should care about the ocean; I just don't want to be there when it happens. If you like sea animals more than you like small humans, be warned that you will be seeing a lot of both if you visit the aquarium. On weekends and holidays, it's possible that humans are packed more tightly together than, well, the sardines in the open sea tank.The aquarium is pretty awesome, even with the crowds. If you've never seen a gigantic bluefin tuna barreling through the water to get its food, it is a damn impressive sight and might make you think twice about your next tuna sandwich. I also love the leopard sharks, which cuddle up to divers, and of course, the jellies and seahorses (don't miss the leafy seadragons!) are mind-blowing. I don't really like the new psychedelic jellyfish exhibit, though, which is kind of cheesy and low on information. If you find yourself wanting more detailed (as in above 3rd grade level) information about any of the exhibits, you'll have to flag down a volunteer with a marine biology background. Everything is very kid-friendly, which is a plus if you have kids or are one, and a minus if you don't.Feeding times are staggered so you can make them all if you time things right. Start with the penguins at 10:30, then the open sea tank at 11, and the California kelp tank at 11:30 (I think -- there is a second feeding time in late afternoon if you miss the morning round). Get there early to grab a good seat and enjoy watching the fish before the crowds start violating your personal space bubble.My recommendation is to get there right at opening time (9:30), leave when it starts to get unbearably crowded to grab lunch, enjoy the coast, or check out Fisherman's Wharf or Cannery Row, and come back late afternoon (5pm) when families have started to go home. Nice ocean sunsets can be had from many of the aquarium's patios."
2171,2013-11-04,5,"Absolutely loved this place!  Huge aquarium with everything you can think of living there!  My nephew, who is going to college to be a marine biologist was mesmerized the entire time; we all were.  Definitely a must see spot when you visit Monterey."
2172,2016-08-05,2,"Really Monterey Bay Aquarium??? $50 bucks a person to get in?Yes, I know they use all that money for conservation and educating the unwashed masses about how they are destroying the ocean and of course saving those cute as hell sea otters!But the truth is this this aquarium is no better than the one in LA which charges half the price and doesn't suffer from the CROWDS OF ANNOYING PEOPLE! And its not that half the people are speaking 30 different languages and seem to have no idea what you mean when you say, 'Excuse me, could you get the hell out of my way?' And its not the fact that half the people bring their children ages 3 and under, using their strollers as a wall to keep you away from the viewing windows. It's just that there are too many people allowed into this place at any given time. Its an interesting problem to have. I suppose they have jacked up the price because they know they can get away with it. People all over the frickin' world seem to want to come here like its the only aquarium that exists. Maybe the solution is for more cities to build aquariums.But isn't it worth it you ask? Sadly, no. The 3 story high tank where kelp grows and schools of anchovies go flying by in circles is definitely a showstopper I haven't seen anywhere else. But most of the exhibits are the same ones you find at any decent aquarium. And two hours is about the maximum amount of time I think anyone will be able to stand being trapped in a building with this crowd! There are live exhibits of those sea otters which you have to fight the crowds to get close enough to see. There are less popular ones of sea birds. There are several exhibits catering to those rugrats where you get the chance to see the entitled brats annoy the hell out of a poor octopus or touch manta rays and star fish a 'little too roughly'. There are tanks of multiple varieties of jellyfish which glow in the dark as you stumble over other foreign tourists to see if a photo will come out. There are also lots of tanks of lots of different fish, most of which sit there staring at you or hide out of view.Is it me or is there something macabre about watching European tourists take hundreds of photos of all the unique fish they have never seen while Asian tourists smile and laugh asking each other which one is the one they ate for lunch?Even more macabre is the horrible location of the aquarium on 'Cannery Row' which has been transformed into the ugliest commercialized outdoor mall filled with useless stores selling tacky  things nobody anywhere needs. The only saving grace is the Monterey Bay itself whose natural beauty is so evident nothing can detract from it, except some fools who have rented plastic kayaks nearby who nearly drown themselves because they have no business being on them. The nearby statue of John Steinbeck's colorful characters from the Cannery Row of old must be laughing in their graves. What once was a whorehouse is now a store that sells Dippin  Dots! God surely must be laughing at us.If you are going to go here be prepared for the $15 to $20 parking fee as well. Any parking lot within walking distance charges that much (if you can find a spot!). But seriously folks. Let the foreign tourists spend their money here to help balance the foreign trade deficit. Donate 50 bucks to your favorite conservation group and find a nice spot on the beach nearby. If you hang out there for an afternoon you will surely see half of the creatures inside the aquarium for free and have a much better time!"
2173,2013-08-22,5,"Now this is an aquarium. Huge, with several floors. Take a whole day off and do this. The touch pond is cool and the live shows they do are fun as well (they had a huge condor-like bird in there). Spectacular views outside the aquarium too on their balconies. After, walk around the cool shops in Cannery Row."
2174,2014-03-23,5,"My family and I have been to the Aquarium a few times now and we always have a great time.  They have a wonderful baby area that is padded and complete with a ""waterbed"" and a little splash fountain.They also have places to park your strollers outside the exhibit if you don't want to roll them around.The Sunfish is back!!!"
2175,2016-01-07,5,"If you visit Monterey, you must visit the Aquarium.  I know, the price can be a little steep, but once you've visited this aquarium, you will find that there are no other in the country that is as good.  This place is huge, I would allot a whole day at this place if it's your first time.  That's the way to get your money's worth, besides there is just too much to look at.  I have been a member of this aquarium, b/c the membership is so worth it.  There are lines to line up for the ticket, so be there early.You can see the penguin feeding, the diver talking, touch the stingray, even see the octopus and countless jelly fish.  They always have a special exhibit going on, and that's a must see.  Oh, and did I mention the otters?The café can be crowded at times and lines are long.  You can always bring your own food, or eat early/ late.  The food is so-so, and pricey too.  The gift shops have a lot of great things in it, some things are pricey.  I look for the sale items which is as good.This aquarium is not only fun for kids, it's great for adults too.  The little kids will enjoy all the curious sights, the big kids will enjoy touching and playing or even just sitting in front of the big tank.  Adults will enjoy everything, learning/ seeing some new creature they discovered in the bay.  I miss my Sunfish.  They say it will be back when it's ready to live with others in the big tank."
2176,2015-09-14,5,"We really enjoyed this! Should have bought the tickets ahead of time, though, because the line to get in for people who had tickets was a lot shorter than the ticket office line. The line moved quickly though and they started selling tickets before the 10am opening time. All the staff members and volunteers were super sweet and friendly and of course the exhibits were beautiful. The feedings were fun to watch if you could get a good spot. Most of the seating is on the floor, though, so you might want to bring a jacket to sit on unless you want to be like the lame adults that just stand around in the back. It's Monterey so you should have a jacket on hand anyway."
2177,2013-09-09,5,"Love this place! Best one I've been to so far, including San Diego, Long Beach and somewhere else I can't remember - Sea World? Lol.Lots and lots of displays and I love how everything seems to be separate but close, like everything is in its own habitat or something. They had a lot of creatures and underwater plant life I've never seen in an aquarium before. I felt like a kid on a field trip!I also loved the outside deck because you're right on the ocean, pretty much and there are lots of good picture spots. Very serene and picturesque place...Next time we visit my sis, I wanna go again. She had the fancy military tickets and we didn't have to wait in line so I will use her for those again. Maybe she'll treat me to smoked buffalo wings at Cannery Row Brewery this time. Oops - distracted by food thoughts.This review was over 3 sentences ago. ;))"
2178,2014-05-10,4,"The aquarium is a great place to go as a family.  There is something for everyone here.  There are some cool interactive exhibits for the kids, and we all enjoy the otters and big fish tanks. We come here at least 2-3 times a year and if you can get a membership it is well worth it. The food is a little pricey but that's not unusual for this type of attraction."
2179,2017-05-06,5,"A Must See attraction!  The Aquarium focuses on the Monterey Bay preserve area, so most of the wonders displayed are exactly like exists within a few hundred yards of where you stand.  The educational displays and very knowledgeable staff make this an awe inspiring treat.  The experience is great for kids, parents and grandparents - we visited as a three-generation family and all had a wonderful time.  Thank you for teaching us about the glorious nature in the Bay."
2180,2014-03-22,5,"I liked the place. Its different from the one in Camden NJ, parking was a problem but great for kids no doubt."
2181,2016-04-04,5,We are members of the Aquarium and love it there. We only get to go a couple of times a year but feel it is worth the visit. This is a wonderful venue to take the family and expose them to another version of the world of wild animals.
2182,2011-01-26,5,"One of my favorite exhibit here are the Jellies.When I was there last week, they featured the Purple Striped, Egg Yolk, Lion Mane, Spotted Medusa, Sea Nettles. They were missing the Crystal Jelly, and I wished they had more.Other highlights were the Seahorses, Pink Flamingos, Penguins, and Sea Otters, everything else is pretty much the average things you find in Aquariums.I don't recommend eating here because the lines are crazy long and the food is overpriced, walk around outside and find something interesting to try.However, if you skip their Cafe, check out their gift shops, they have a total of 3, and I wanted to buy everything. I really like that they have like 10 different jellyfish souvenirs :) But once again, most of the gifts are overpriced, so don't spend too much. Admission price is not so bad, but I hate to pay for parking, $15 for parking sucks.On a different note, if you are claustrophobic, don't come here, if you must, go on a Monday or Tuesday. I normally don't mind children, but I do not understand the parents who bring their children here. Yes, I know children run and play, but why must they all scream at once? Please have a hold on your children, you don't have to yell or hit them. Please have proper discipline techniques to keep a hold of them, it's really embarrassing how parents lack disciplinary skills these days."
2183,2016-01-02,5,"A must. This is likely why you are here. I can't stress more to think of questions to ask the docents. Local volunteers go through extensive training just to tell you anything you want to know about the Monterey Bay critters. Ask what THEY are fascinated with if you draw a blank. Look through the microscopes with the docents at Monterey mini-critters. Everyone is trying to touch a ray but the microscopic area is often void of people...and it's worth a look.I love the South American Blackfooted penguins and the puffins. My 9 year-old grandson was encouraged by this aquarium to do his GATE presentation on them and begin an adoption program for this endangered penguin. At last count,  Max's Central Valley,  CA penguin program has funded 10 birds.  Learning and conservation of our planet is the real point of this amazing aquarium. Hungry? Save $? Walk up the little hill and grab a deli sandwich at Nob Hill grocery store with the locals."
2184,2014-02-05,4,"This is a great place to take the family. Parking is easy enough and there's lots of food options around on Cannery Row. The design of the space itself flows well so that you never feel like there are too many people or the space is too tight. The only caveat on that is regarding the demonstrations they do like when they feed the otters or the penguins. There isn't enough space for everyone who crowds around to get a good view. The demonstration where the diver goes into the big tank and feeds the fish works well though. There seems to be enough space. I am guessing the other two weren't planned for when the place was designed.As for the selection of aquatic life, I am no expert but to me it was great. If you're coming from the Bay Area take the route from 101 to 156 instead of trying 85 to 17. Too curvy that way and will likely take longer."
2185,2014-03-17,5,"I love all the new upgrades that they have been making over the past few years.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium remains my favorite aquarium in the United States and is by far the best on the west coast.  I have been to so many aquariums and none other compare with this one, you should for sure plan to spend a day here if in the area! This place is for people of all ages, they even have some souvenir stores that are fairly reasonable."
2186,2013-09-20,4,"Just a gorgeous looking aquarium.  My personal favorite was the jellyfish exhibit, and even though it was a little crowded than I anticipated when I went (Friday), it was fun to see.  The ticket is a little pricier than I thought it would be, even with my friend's military discount (saved around $1.25/ticket?)."
2187,2010-10-31,5,"I've really, really tried to beat the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I grew up in South Santa Cruz County, so this is the aquarium that they always brought us to in school and the only aquarium I've really ever known.  When I travel, I check out other aquariums...just to see how they stack up.  I went to UCSD, and even the amazing and wonderful Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Birch Aquarium doesn't even come CLOSE to Monterey's.  I've been to the New England Aquarium, the Seattle Aquarium, Birch Aquarium, and several others that aren't worth mentioning.  Monterey is hands down the best (though Georgia Aquarium is on my list of potential contenders...and, I will say that the Seattle Aquarium makes for a good, but small, second place).One of the major things that MBA has going for it is its sheer size.  The place is HUGE!  As a result, they have tons of exciting exhibits that you can get really engaged with.  The new seahorse exhibit they have is particularly amazing, and the aquarium was the first (and only?) one to ever successfully hold a great white shark in captivity (that is, until they discovered that it was taking nibbles out of al of the 500 pound tuna in the same tank...).They have lots of exhibits for kids, sea otters, large viewing tanks for all kinds of fish, penguins, and a great setting overlooking the Monterey Bay, which is basically integrated into the aquarium as its own exhibit.  The jellyfish tanks are also especially interesting...Parking can be a pain, as you should either expect to walk pretty far or pay a decent amount for parking.  There are some meters nearby, though, and if you're not with kids and aren't someone who likes to read every sign, attend every event, and spend hours at each tank, you can probably do the whole thing in about 2 or 3 hours.The staff at the aquarium are always friendly, and the price of admission is reasonable.  If you're ever near Monterey (like, anywhere even close...), you should check it out.  It's definitely worth it."
2188,2013-06-28,5,"Seriously!! Monterey Bay Aquarium is an institution of PURE AWESOME!!Lots of different tanks to view any type of underwater creature your heart desires... even those weird looking ones, I think they call them scuba divers? hhh.Kid has visited more times I ever have (he's lucky, my sis and bil take him everywhere and often get to take the little guy to places before me and hubby do!!)  There is so much to see and do here, that like Disneyland, you might not get to it all in one visit....Our favourites:  the glow in the dark room full of glowing jelly fish, the giant octopus!, seeing sharks, the  hands on interaction with starfish, watching our son be able to stand on the ground and have tons of views of fish at his eye-level."
2189,2015-01-16,5,Always a good day when we go to the aquarium in Monterey. A lot of people have season passes. The kids love the place. It's especially good for a rainy day.
2190,2016-03-30,5,"Awesome, as always!   A place for the locals to not miss as well as all the travelers."
2191,2011-08-09,5,"Words cannot discribe how much I love this place. My friend and I spent 3 hourse emerged in the beauty of the water world. This place sometimes has Great Whites. Rumour has it, that there will be one this fall,so make sure to call ahead. Where else can u see a great white up close and learn more about it, without spending an arm and a leg for diving?"
2192,2016-04-29,4,I've been here many times and I really appreciate all the research that they do for marine life and the enviroment. YAY
2193,2013-11-18,5,Had a great itme. it was very cleanand educational. Friendly staff and good food to snack on. only bad part is the parking
2194,2016-03-28,5,"Probably the world's best aquarium. Expensive, but it's for a good cause. Kids loved it!"
2195,2015-05-27,1,"This  aquarium  went  from  awesome  to awful taking  out displays of animals  and replacing them  with  video  screens and interactive displays defeats  the purpose  of going, you can access  on internet  why pay 40$. Last visit took 4to 5hrs  this visit  took 1&1-2hrs what a disappointment"
2196,2013-09-18,5,"Add a star for kids. Educational/intriguing for adults. It can be a little pricey, but definitely one of the better things to do while in Monterey."
2197,2016-02-29,5,"I really appreciate the locals discount days!  It helps people in this community feel even more connected to what's going on locally.  The staff are always friendly and helpful, everyone seems very passionate about the work they are doing to educate people and continue to preserve our oceans!"
2198,2015-07-13,2,"This place is way overpriced considering the fact that the attractions are all located inside one building!  With thousands of people coming here on a daily basis, the prices should be in the range where the common person can afford it.  And to think they preach it's educational value.  What about teaching the value of our hard earned cash?!"
2199,2015-10-09,5,"This is my favorite aquarium.  I haven't been to them all but this one is better than any in Texas, Vancouver, or Tampa Bay.  The size is just right and they're very creative in their presentation.  The entire area is a nice place to just spend the day by the ocean and enjoy nature in all its glory."
2200,2015-10-07,4,"Awesome aquarium in an more awesome area.  I think I like coming here more than my kids do! ONE HUGE piece of advice, if you're coming on the weekend, especially during tourist season, come early morning right when the doors open, otherwise, weekdays are the best.  Everyone in norcal knows this is the best aquarium, so it get's crowded.  I suppose it can be romantic too...I've seen two marriage proposals on two separate occasions. :P"
2201,2015-11-08,5,The deep sea tank was AMAZING! This is definitely the best aquarium I've ever visited
2202,2016-03-23,5,"Perhaps a bit pricey, but this is my favorite spot in town.  I could spend the whole day here, but if you're in a hurry you could probably see almost everything in an afternoon."
2203,2015-11-05,5,I haven't been to the aquarium in about 15 years. This place is amazingly fantastic I'm glad that we came during a weekday because it wasn't too crowded.. the weather was amazing the views were fantastic and the exhibits were spectacular. They sure knew they sure know how to take care of the animals. I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves the sea.
2204,2016-01-12,5,"I love when they have a great white on display. I'm sad that the lower lever otter exhibit is closed. This place is wonderful. I enjoy their educational theater and interactive stations, lots of fun things to do and interesting things to see."
2205,2012-12-31,2,"The place is fairly small so I do not understand $34.95 per adult admission fee! Go on craigslist and find less expansive tickets, you can find them for $15 per person. It took me about  2 hours to see everything and place was very crowded. The parking I her is $20 so I parked on the street and moved my car few times, it is only 2 hour parking. Best part of the Monterey Bay Aquarium..the jelly fish!"
2206,2013-09-08,5,"I love aquariums in general, so of course I'd love this place. It's big with a great layout, and lots of wonderful animals. We walked in this time to catch the sea otters first and they are so adorable as they are quite playful (and just plain amusing to watch).The Jellyfish Experience blows me away each time as it's one of my favourite exhibits to walk around in. There are so many different types and it's such a gorgeous setup.There are a lot of different things to praise in this aquarium and I could go on for a while. Overall it's a great learning experience and well worth the trip."
2207,2011-11-03,4,"Non profit.What else is there, really, on Cannery Row? It's pricey but you have to go  at least once. $29.95 for Adults.It's beautiful and educational.. very kid-friendly. They showcase marine life well.. But for some reason, I thought there would be more to see.No flash photography signage is in certain areas. I can understand when you don't know the flash on your camera was on.. but, when people continually do it over and over.. that's annoying.Although, during our time there, I thought it was nice that staff members would offer to take photos of the two of us for us.. They have a gift shop and even a restaurant in case you get hungry.. I don't have a clue on the parking situation. We stayed at a nearby hotel. Being in walking distance was a big plus."
2208,2011-07-21,5,"The girlfriend's father flew in from San Diego, so we were off & running on a frenetic weekend NorCal sightseeing spree.Day 1 was San Francisco. For day 2, we went South to Monterey. Being total tourists, we went to Monterey's biggest attraction, the Monterey Bay Aquarium.This place is simply amazing. All of the displays & exhibits are incredibly well done with the all-too-important message of conservation interwoven throughout. With some really cool hands-on & interactive exhibits along with kid friendly areas & activities, there's something here for everyone.Hours flew by faster than I expected. The only reason I was even aware of the passage of time was the need to leave more than once to feed the parking meter.In my role as tour guide, I wanted to impress & the Monterey Bay Aquarium made a huge splash (I know, dreadful pun, sometimes I just can't help myself, it's a sickness really).If you've never been, you need to come check it out. If you have been, bring someone who hasn't, they'll love it."
2209,2011-01-02,4,"We love the Monterey Bay Aquarium and all it has to offer...  The prices are a bit steep these days ($29 adult $17 child), but it is definitely a cool experience if you have never been...  We come every couple of years to see the changes, as they are always renovating or updating their exhibits.  This time around we experienced the Seahorse exhibit, which blew my mind with several that I have never seen in my life!  The Outer Reef is always a favorite exhibit to see with the humongous tank that holds their famous sun fish, sharks, and tunas.  It was too bad it was closed this time around for renovations...  But we were satisfied as usual checking out the bird sanctuary and manta ray exhibits which offer you a chance to touch them as they swim by...  Kids love the touch and feel exhibits with the star fish, sea cucumber, kelp, sand crab, sea urchins, etc...  The sea otter exhibit is also playful, and fun to watch.Be sure to venture outside to check out the seals lying on the nearby rocks.  Free telescopes to view them up close.Plenty to see and do for all ages."
2210,2013-09-28,5,Amazing. Beautiful aquarium and presentation. My favorite exhibits were the otters and the jelly fish. We forgot to check out the octopus...next time.  A bit expensive but worth it.
2211,2015-05-18,1,"Not worth the cost. $40 per adult and $35 per youth. Do not buy a full day parking pass since you will only visit the aquarium for about 2 hours (2 adults and 3 youth=$185.) The value isn't there. From other negative reviews a rebuttal was replied with where fees go towards, ect... No reponse needed here. $20-$25 is a reasonable cost per adult"
2212,2013-03-09,5,As always a pure treat.  On this particular occasion we were able to spend the night inside the aquarium.  What a great opportunity.  The staff tends to you and the kids and you get to scope out your spots.  You get self guided tours at night which is way cool.  Being able to see the wildlife of the deck during the early hours is something to behold.  Such a beautiful wondrous place that is not to be missed!
2213,2016-04-19,5,I loved this place.  It was so pretty and super educational.
2214,2014-06-07,3,Beautiful aquarium lots of local ocean lifePrice is to costly for families. And very crowded.
2215,2016-04-19,4,"Great place! I would go more if I could! Weekdays are the best time to go, if you want to avoid a huge crowd."
2216,2015-09-24,3,"I wasn't impressed.... Grew irritated when I kept saying the same animals....ie tiger sharks,  sardines and anchovies.... They do have good exhibits .. Just not enough... If you are ever in Baltimore,  the Baltimore Aquarium is a good bet"
2217,2017-04-18,5,Our family loves to visit the Aquarium when we are in Monterey. We have children of all ages who enjoy the exhibits and activities. We took a 3-months old baby this time and he enjoyed the dark rooms with soothing underwater sounds. The staff and volunteers are knowledgeable and friendly. Gift shops and cafe are great!
2218,2015-10-26,4,"We had fun bringing our daughter here. She liked looking at the jellyfish. My husband and I loved it too. Minus 1 star because they don't have stroller rentals so we carried her everywhere because it was crowded. Our fault we forgot the stroller though! It would have been helpful to rent one though. Otherwise, it was fun."
2219,2013-08-13,5,"Last time I went to Monterey Bay Aquarium was in the 6th grade for a school field trip (that is well over 10 years), oh the days of attending a private school and going on cool field trips without a care in the world. Fast forward ~12 years later and instead of coming here with classmates, I came here with my boyfriend, it was still as fun as it was all those years ago and maybe more fun since I understand more than before.It is seriously such a big place so plan accordingly if you do not live close by because you want to have ample of time to see everything and be able to drive home without the traffic (although I doubt you can beat out the traffic).I personally love the jelly fish area..moon jelly fish!"
2220,2013-04-15,4,"So I made my way back a year later and decided to once again stop by and enjoy the Aquarium.   The price went up several dollars in one year.  It's a wonderful attraction but it is getting too expensive.  A stop at the snack bar kind of annoyed me, a small milk was several dollars - just plain gouging.We went to several of the lectures which were excellent.  The place was just packed with kids to the point that it was a germ fest but, many of the  exhibits are geared towards children so I guess that is to be expected.I like this place but it is too expensive even for what it is."
2221,2011-04-16,5,"I came here on a beautiful sunny weekend and this place did not disappoint.  I've been to the California Academy of Science in SF and I like this place much better.  It's not as crowded as CAS so I can actually see the aquatic animals and not just a sea of people.My favorite exhibits were the sea otters, seahorses, penguins, flamingos, and jellyfish (the eggyolk jellyfish!!).  Pretty much everything :DThis place is also located at the end of cannery row, which is similar to fisherman's wharf in SF.  Nice place to walk around and enjoy the California sun.  I highly recommend checking out the aquarium for a short weekend getaway."
2222,2015-10-19,5,"I think it's gotta be a crime to be anywhere in Monterey and not actually hit this aquarium. Save your pennies for weeks on end if necessary to get in here. I can tell you from 1st hand experience, you'll come out a much happier person than when you entered, guaranteed!!"
2223,2013-08-11,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium does an excellent job of covering amazing and diverse aquatic wildlife. The aquarium is packed with awesome exhibits including areas dedicated just to jelly fish and seahorses. There are also two massive tanks: the Kelp Forest -- one of the tallest aquarium exhibits in the world -- and the Open Sea, which features a mind-boggling 90-foot viewing window. Prepare to spend a couple of hours exploring every nook and cranny of this aquarium because it is totally worth it. The bay and ocean is home to some interesting forms of life that truly boggle the mind. The aquarium is wildly popular, and right in the tourist trap of Cannery Row, so expect the place to be packed with visitors. You'll have to wait a few minutes at each exhibit for a chance to look at the wildlife up close. Also, expect to pay an arm and a leg for parking. Not a huge deal, but prepare to endure a frustrated search.And now, time for an educational rant. For some mind-boggling reason, it seems visitors love watching the ""cute"" sea otters. I know the aquarium is supposed to be family friendly, but I wish there would was some education about the uglier side of otters. They are intelligent enough (like humans, monkeys, and dolphins) to get a twisted joy out of doing messed up stuff. Just between 2000 and 2002 there were fifteen documented cases of sadistic otters raping, and during the process killing, baby harbor seals right in the Monterey Bay!"
2224,2016-08-31,3,"Nice place to take the kids, a little overpriced. My wife won the argument as this is a day trip, no need to stay overnight as you may not be at the aquarium the entire day.  A bit overpriced.My family and my brother in laws family went to Monterey to visit the aquarium Friday morning. We probably havent been here for morw than 10-15 years. We found parking a few blocks away at $15. We probably should have just taken the free trolley from the hotel. The price is a bit steep but fortunately they had a small veterans/military/senior discount my party was able to use. We went to the open ocean feeding which had a good speaker and swarms of fish occasionally being attacked by a dolphin which made it quite interesting. The speaker was good throughout. Go early or up to the balcony early if you want a good spot as the place was packed. We moved on to browse around. The kids got to touch a starfish but for some reason they were more interested in the bookmark stamps, the water current exhibit and the kids play area. Afrer a couole of hours we had our fill of the aquarium and left. We thought about coming back later after lunch (dont forget to stamp your own  hand near the exit) but we ended up heading home.Overall it was nice to get out of town but for the money spent here we could have gone to our local zoo many times and the kids have just as much fun."
2225,2016-01-28,4,"Although pricey (~$40 per person) I would say it was worth it for my first time ever at an aquarium. They have many attractions to look at and even a small area where you can touch starfish and small sea creatures. The giant fish tank with the sea turtle, tuna, and sharks was absolutely amazing. I could have spent several hours there just watching them swim."
2226,2016-04-09,5,Great place to bring the kids.  There's a lot of different things to see.  They have different things going on during the day that ate educational for everyone. The price is a bit high but overall it's a great place to visit.
2227,2015-01-06,4,"Monterey area in general has quite a bit of history, especially in the seafood canning industry and aside from the marine life, there is a nice exhibit about life in Monterey during this period as well as an area that has a couple thing about John Steinbeck, (you know, Cannery Row, Grapes of Wrath, of Mice and Men)We went New Years Day, and I bought tickets while waiting in-line on my phone. You can come and go, just make sure you get a hand stamp. Bring food, or eat out, cheaper and probably better quality food. For two teas and a snicker doodle, we spent $13.00Then on to the anticipated aquarium.Somebody compared some of the exhibits to the Mandalay Bay Shark exhibit, which wow, i'm shocked. Last time I recall LV didn't have an ocean within 200 miles that feeds into that exhibit tank.Get to the Sea Otter feeding early. Trust me, the otters will entertain you while you are waiting. Then be prepared for the banging on the window that comes when they do feed, and that's all I'll say.The Jelly fish NEVER get old, and you certainly don't need drugs to enhance this experience and you can get in a relaxed trance just wanted them, thought like someone said the Jellies experience have been created with a little medicinal help, and perhaps Jimi Hendrix was a fan of the Jellies, groovy man!Highly recommend the videos bout Luna the sea otter and the Great White. Also, if you were a fan of Paul Walker, check out the National Geographic Great White experience. I couldn't figure out why he gave a big talk, but after watching that and seeing the presentation  at the aquarium you can see the big picture on Great Whites and it's awesome.While some people complain about the price, just remember you are contributing to a non-profit that is striving hard to protect the environment, but educating the public, this is evident by the plastic exhibits that end up in the sea and harm these animals.  So you have to decide is spending $300 on average at Disneyland for mindless entertainment every year is worth it, or maybe seeing what is out there that maybe we can keep for future generations. Do some of these exhibits change much, probably not, because that is a big under taking and can be disruptive to the animals.If you are or know someone who is thinking of becoming and marine biologist or working the biology field, bring them they will appreciate it. Maybe they'll be inspired to find one of the many mysteries in the deep blue that are still undiscovered."
2228,2017-03-08,4,It's a nice place to visit With family or friends. Kids can learn lot of things here . It's worth for the price what you pay .
2229,2015-12-16,5,This place is a good as it gets!  The have a fabulous area for little ones not he second floor.  Make time to see the hammerheads and huge tuna too!
2230,2013-05-26,4,"Like others have stated, admission is very pricey. But the aquarium itself is very nice. I loved the Jellyfish Experience (very trippy) and the sea otters! I ended up having to take a sea otter stuffed animal home with me! Luckily, it was on sale. A lot of the gifts in the gift shops were very over priced, but that's where they get you I guess.I loved the shows in the auditorium. Each show is about 15 minutes long, long enough to give us some good information but short enough that our attention span is kept at the front.BE SURE TO GET HERE EARLY! Like, when it opens. We got here in the morning right when it opened and by the time we left there was a huge line going around the corner. It DOES get packed."
2231,2018-01-21,4,"Beautiful space and some terrific displays (the deep sea section with the jellyfish was mesmerizing and a can't miss). It's pretty darn expensive though--kids under 3 are free and if you buy your tickets through certain hotels, like the Hyatt Regency where we stayed, your ticket is good for 2 days-- and if you have ever seen the aquarium at the Dubai Mall, which is free, it makes the cloudy big tank here slightly underwhelming given the amount of crowds you have to battle. Still, kids do love it and it's well-thought our layout-wise and family friendly. They could add a little more to the tide pools-petting area since they're all pretty empty and the kelp one just looks like the stuff that washes up on the beach and thrown into a plastic tub table. The feeding shows are also not quite worth the hype since it basically becomes like a mosh pit with everyone crowding to get close to the glass. Just not a great experience given the pushy kids (the bigger ones push away the little ones) or the pushy parents. I decided to opt out of the penguin one and take our daughter to the play area since you couldn't even see the penguins and going to an aquarium just to watch something on a mounted TV since you can't actually see the exhib is just silly...the place is well-run though and everyone who works there is super nice and genuinely friendly."
2232,2014-06-30,5,Kids....love it.Eats....near Cannery Row with tons of places to eatIce Cream and Frozen Yogurt....2-3Memorizing displays....don't forget to blink This place was a great day of fun and equaled a great night sleep when the kids were just plain tired.
2233,2013-04-15,4,"Magnificent, great, a must visit ""once I a life time"" but it is so expensive...almost $35 per adult ( I work almost a full shift for this kind of money ).Parking in private lots is around $10 per day but be careful that you don't have the in and out privilege or on the street ...a rip of $1.50 per hour.Add that to the gas from San Francisco, bottled water at the café inside the aquarium and lunch after visit for two and here you go home short of $200.Worth it but once a year.Good luck and enjoy the Bat-ray touching :)))"
2234,2015-08-31,3,Love the aquarium and all there is to see and learn about life under the ocean. Was busy for a Friday but we were able to visit everything. The only negative thing I have to say is the cafe. It is overpriced. I got the turkey sandwich and the fontina bread was stale and the lettuce was wilting. I should have known not to order a sandwich that is already sitting out and premade. Next time I will leave the aquarium to eat elsewhere.
2235,2014-01-20,4,"Always a treat to come here no matter what age . I came here as a child, teenager, and adult and each time I have a different and equally enjoyable experience . I try to go during the slow season but even then there's a line out the door for tickets before they even open. Was sad last time because the 2 story otter habitat was close : ( still a great experience ."
2236,2015-08-26,5,Everyone knows how amazing this place is. I love that I can now take my son to a place I cherished growing up I want to point out that when we last visited the aquarium I was thrilled at how polite and happy everyone was. People weren't cutting us off or standing in the way.... If only all tourist attractions were like this!
2237,2014-09-01,5,Beyond excellent.  Earned a world reputation as one of the finest.   Excellent for children and families.  Superb staff of volunteers and professional.   We are proud to be supporting members.  Fabulous!
2238,2012-09-12,5,"I love this place!!!  I've been here plenty of times and I never grow tired of this aquarium.  It's a fascinating experience to be able to see the world underneath the big blue sea.  When will you ever get to see a school of blue fin tuna, sharks, jellyfishes, starfishes, seahorses, sea otters, etc. up close and personal???  This aquarium has many exotic underwater creatures for you to enjoy!  It's spacious, beautifully organized, and jam packed with information and fun facts about the animals they have on display.  I've gone back recently and noticed they added a few new exhibits.  Monterey Bay Aquarium has stayed the same for the most part, but it really brings a special feeling of warmth inside of me because every time I come here it reminds me of my past visits as a grade schooler.  Loved, loved our class field trips!  It definitely takes me back in time ;).  This place never gets old. Go!!! It's worth experiencing if you're in the area!  It's in a beautiful location with lots to see!"
2239,2011-06-17,4,"BEST AQUARIUM EVER! I am a HUUUUGE science fan so my review is pretty biased. This is the first time I have ever been here and I came STRICTLY to see a great white shark. On Discovery Channel they had something about it years ago so I thought it was an all the time thing. Apparently it is not and that section will be open on July 2nd, ""Open Sea"". If they catch a baby great white they will see if he is compatible for life there for a bit. So I was bummed that I didn't get to see my shark but the rest was GREAT! This place is soooo huge that it takes a few hours to go through the entire aquarium. It is only $28 with a military/student discount to get into the place and you can leave and come back if you get your hand stamped. I think my favorite part was the Kelp Forest (where the video is from) because it just seemed so beautiful and there were even schools of fish swimming together, which I've never seen in person before.    There's a restaurant that I heard was pretty good in the aquarium but I did not eat there myself. I did browse through all the gift shops though and was amazed at all the different kinds of books, videos, etc. they had. I felt like a kid all over again!  ***IF THEY DO GET A GREAT WHITE, THEY SAID IT MIGHT BE AROUND SEP-OCT BEFORE IT WILL ACTUALLY BE IN THE AQUARIUM.***"
2240,2015-12-06,5,I LOVE the Monterey bay aquarium! I have a membership for my family and I could come once a week and it will never get old! So many beautiful fish to look at! My favorite is the big tank with the giant turtle and the hammer head sharks! My daughter whose almost 2 loves all the touch and feel areas and the play area. Who wouldn't like to touch and explore! We are blessed to live so close and to have the opportunity to come so often!
2241,2014-01-14,3,I don't know what the big deal is here. Some jellyfish and seahorse. Woohoo. Nothing out of the ordinary. Over priced tickets. Long admission line (check w/3rd party vendors for faster NOT cheaper alternatives). Lots of kids. LOTS Still cool and fun? Ya. Definitely. Would I come back again? Naaaa.
2242,2013-07-22,5,"This place is AWESOME. Best aquarium I've ever been to and overall great place to visit. We were there during an epic winter storm and the whole town had lost power, but not the aquarium! So we didn't get to experience the outdoor stuff, but the indoor stuff was cool enough. They were having a special otter thing when we were there...I freaking LOVE otters and they had like every kind and a bunch of different exhibits. So I was in heaven. And the jellyfish thing is really cool.Super cool place even just for adults but obviously it would be fun to take kids, too."
2243,2013-07-06,5,"I never tire of visiting this aquarium. Of all the aquariums in the world that I have been to (a good number at this point) this is the best. If you are a tourist and are afraid that it is a tourist trap, don't worry. It is a ""must visit"" location for a day."
2244,2013-04-12,5,"How in the world anyone could not like the Monterey bay aquarium is beyond comprehension.  We drove up from Cayucos to take the grand kids to the aquarium and they had a fantastic time.  I personally hand't been here in many years so it definitely brought back memories.  In fact, the whole area around the aquarium is just beautiful.If your in to learning, biology or just for fun, this place is well worth it!"
2245,2016-03-31,4,Very cool aquarium to visit....so crowded even during the week....outer feeding was adorable....shark movie interesting...jellyfish cool
2246,2016-03-29,5,One of my absolute favorite places. It's better in the later afternoons when it's not as crowded.
2247,2012-09-02,5,"This is the most amazing aquarium. I've never been to one where the fish look so happy. Like really, the place is absolutely gigantic and the fish have plenty of space to wiggle around and do their fishy activities.If you go to the front desk and ask for a birthday present (my bf did this), they will give you a free birthday pin memorabilia. Get it and cherish it."
2248,2016-03-26,5,"I loved the kelp forest, and the Jellyfish exibit. They were by far my favorite. The spool of fish was kinda neat too."
2249,2013-01-18,5,"I absolutely love this aquarium. I've been to a decent amount of aquariums in my lifetime but none compare to the Monterey Bay. I've never been to an aquarium where they have an observation deck that allows you to spot sea otters in the wild! I almost cried (not joking at all) when I saw my first wild sea otter just rolling around in seaweed. Apparently people have witnessed whales from the same observation point but I couldn't see any (but that doesn't mean they don't exist!). There are so many different exhibits to check out that it can be a bit overwhelming. My favorite was when they fed the sea otters and did a demonstration on how they feed. Despite the fact I'm 22 I thought it was reasonable to get to the feeding tank 20 minutes before the presentation to stake out a good sitting spot. Kids that are like 4 have only loved sea otters for about 2 years. I've loved them for at least 20. Plus I'm older so it just like makes sense.I received a yearly membership pass as a present and I was ecstatic. I also managed to get a stuffed sea otter which is also pretty awesome. Great for kids, fun place for dates and a lovely way to interact with the creatures of the ocean."
2250,2015-03-16,4,"As a monterey resident, I visit the aquarium multiple times a year. Full price admission is steep, but with friends who work there and community weeks, I rarely pay full price. The outer bay is my favorite."
2251,2013-12-27,5,"I have been wanting to visit this aquarium for some time and my boyfriend and I have enjoyed watching the various web cams of penguin feedings and otter antics as well. We went the day after Christmas, which we overheard one of the employees say is their busiest day of the year. It was very crowded but we still had a great time and saw everything we wanted to see. The extended hours were a bonus too.The facility is very wheelchair accessible and most of the time a volunteer anticipated our need for a lift or elevator and pointed out their location to us. This was very helpful because the lifts can be sort of inconspicuous, especially by the sea otters. Besides the sea otters, who can't help but be adorable, one of the best attractions was the area with the jellyfish. Such brilliant colors and variety - they are truly mesmerizing. Really, every exhibit we encountered brought its own sense of awe and wonder and made you feel somehow more connected to the universe. It would be nice to visit again on a day without all the ""hustle and bustle"" but this was a thoroughly enjoyable day."
2252,2013-11-15,5,"This aquarium is incredible!! Gotta be one of the top in the nation. Wedecided to take a visit on our way through Monterey headed up to SF. All of the exhibits are wonderful and everyone there is very friendly. The tuna tank and the giant octopus were probably my favorite. The area around the aquarium is great for just walking around and checking out: lots of shops, restaurants, sights, etc. I don't think I would go on a weekend. We went on a Friday morning and there were lots of children running around. I'd wager it's worse on a Saturday and Sunday or holiday weekend. Go during the week to really enjoy it."
2253,2015-10-10,5,"I had been here when it first opened in 1984 as we were living at Fort Ord @ that time.  My sis & I really enjoyed our visit here today, we got bonus as whole foods was doing a whole food thing with samples out on the tide pool deck, so we got to taste alot of good stuff.  They also had a food demo with fish & questions about sustainable fishing.  As we went throughout the aquarium we were both thinking what a cool place it would be to bring kids.  Hoping to do that next year.  I felt it was absolutely worth the cost!!!  If you get the chance you should go:)"
2254,2017-01-06,5,"Bottom Line Up Front: The best Aquarium this side of the Mississippi.  I am fortunate to have all year access to this little tourist trap : )  I try to go when it is not a free to the public week, for the obvious reasons of overcrowding; I can't enjoy it when there too many people.  I come here to relax and people watch.  The restaurant is decent, it is an experience but better restaurants with comparable prices. I like watching the tunas swim and imagine what they taste like... lol : ) I usually go for sushi after a visit.  I also like the jelly fish exhibit, so relaxing. I am usually in and out under 1.5 hours and that is taking my time, so if you don't want to pay for parking park by street that has free 90 minute parking; look out for free parking with out of service meters.  This is a good place to take someone on a date when it is not crowded for example 1.5 hours before closing, quiet can be private and you guys can check out if you share same frames of references; Na Mean : )"
2255,2015-11-13,5,Another fun day spent here with my 3 kids.  Only planned for 2 hours and ended up here for 5 hours.  So many hands on activities for the kids to do.  Miss the sea horse exhibit.  The jellies are gone but the tentacles exhibit had a cool octopus on display.  Also saw the cuttlefish feeding.
2256,2013-07-31,5,"Had a blast at the Monterey Bay Aquarium :D So much to see, so many tours to go on!amphibiansreptilesbirdsfishesmarine mammalsplants/algaeinvertebratesWill be coming back again!! :D"
2257,2014-12-16,5,Oh yes! Best fun ever! I'm just in love with marine life so every time I go there I feel I'm in another world...in a world of happiness :) It is really impressive. I prefer to go when there are not too many tourists so that I can enjoy it better ;)
2258,2017-03-20,5,I took so many great pictures and had great experiences here! I only wish they had more than one exhibit for the seahorses. Everyone has said it already... This place is really the best you can get in California for aquariums right now :)
2259,2016-02-02,5,"Awesome experience at the monterey bay aquarium. Very courteous volunteers, varieties of species. Vibrant colors... very educational,  can't wait to come back again..."
2260,2015-03-09,5,"I love visiting aquariums, and this one is as good as it gets. I got to catch a glimpse of wild sea otters off the back deck, as well as see the 3 that they keep on display. I have never seen an aquarium with so many huge tanks. The kelp forest with it's open top and multiple levels of viewing was incredible.This place is pricey, but it was well worth it for me."
2261,2013-03-06,5,A good surprise getting in.Excellent facilities.You must see when you are in the area.Very well set and specially friendly personnel.
2262,2016-03-17,5,"Absolutely stunning! I have never thought I could have gotten this close and personal with sea life. I love how it is designed making the experience very fulfilling. There were quite a few people at the same time as us, but that's kind of expected. When I'm back in this area I'll definitely return. My kids loved it as well as myself!"
2263,2013-05-12,5,Always a joy to visit the aquarium. Took my 3 year old niece here and she was in awe at just about every turn. Great place to educate kids about the environment. The staff are all super friendly and knowledgable.
2264,2015-09-26,5,They have such a diverse sea jelly exhibit! We definitely enjoyed it!
2265,2016-01-25,5,Best aquarium around.  Catch the live feedings and the short movies / Documentaries.  Great fun for the whole family.
2266,2012-09-10,5,"My Husband and I have the pleasure of visiting the aquarium at least once a year when we go up to visit family.  This is one of the best aquariums in the world and the surrounding location is amazingly beautiful.  This place is obviously really well reviewed already, so I'll just mention my personal favorites.My personal favorites are the Kelp Forest, the Open Sea Exhibit, the jellies, the sea horses, and their male octopus because he's a total show off!  The Kelp Forest in particular is a great place to just sit back and relax if you've been walking all day. They have benches nearby and you can sketch there very comfortably.If you have any interest in the history of the aquarium and would like to understand more about how they have accomplished things that no other aquarium has been able to do, then I recommend the Behind-the-Scenes tour.  Make use of the volunteers!  Ask them questions!  They are all passionate about the aquarium and the animals and they are glad to share that passion with you!  And remember to thank them because they are working for free because they love the aquarium and they work really hard!  This aquarium is doing wonderful things in research, conservation and education and you will not regret a moment of your time here!"
2267,2015-07-16,5,"Great aquarium to visit. Friendly, available and knowledgable staff. So much to see and do. Otters are fun, Open Seas tank and kelp Forest are impressive. The Scuba Underwater Explorers program for kids was great fun. The Feeding Frenzy tour was very educational and entertains. Cafe and gift shops were perfect adventures. The staff and volunteers are the best,so helpful and bright."
2268,2013-07-15,4,All the workers here are very nice and helpful. :)I loved the open sea feeding which apparently only happens once a day.My favorite is the jellyfish because they're so beautiful and arrogant.There are no words to explain all the beautiful things that you see here.
2269,2015-08-17,5,Most beautiful place to visit. You won't regret the drive from wherever your coming from. The ocean deck overlooking the ocean is amazing. So worth the visit.
2270,2015-09-18,5,Wonderful place!! Been there twice with my brothers and we loved it both times. I look forward to visiting again in the future :)
2271,2015-08-14,5,"Best aquarium you are gonna find in the west coast.  I haven't been here since 1998, but brought my daughter here for her first time recently and we had a blast.  Try to come on a weekday to beat the crowd."
2272,2016-01-18,5,I hadn't been to this aquarium since I was little. I don't remember much of it from then but I swear its tripled in size. So much fun looking at all the animals and so much to learn. I'm a huge animal lover so I was obviously in heaven. I can't wait to go back and share this spot with my baby.
2273,2016-01-18,4,"The aquarium is a must-visit on any trip to Monterey. While it is smaller than some other aquariums, and you're not going to see the bigger mammals, it's because this aquarium is actually trying to do good for the creatures of the sea. And it's not good for those big mammals to be confined to tanks.The highlights for me are the adorable sea otters, the jelly fish (just search Instagram for everyone's favorite bright-orange jellies), and the education they give on sustainable fishing. If you eat fish, they have a great guide to steer you toward what in your area is the most sustainable to eat and where to find it."
2274,2016-01-17,4,"So many memorable experiences in half a day.  We were disappointed that were no tours available but we made the most of our day.  The otter feeding met our expectations, how can you not smile when you look at those cute faces floating on their backs and rubbing their bellies.  The Open sea feeding was breath taking.  Most of the staff were enthusiastic to share their knowledge to the kids."
2275,2016-01-17,5,"I love this aquarium! I go every Veteran's Day to see what it has to offer and it never disappoints. You could get lost in here for hours very easily, and I don't mean that it has confusing elements. There's just so much to see! Staff is always very welcoming and friendly, and the exhibits are phenomenal. My husband and I are suckers for the sea otters, and the sting ray touch tank is one of my favourites. Though it may end up being irrelevant for many, this aquarium rivals the quality of Baltimore's!"
2276,2013-06-16,4,"A lot to see. Love the jellies & sea otters, sea horses The huge tank with a ton of tuna, a sea turtle, some sharks"
2277,2013-07-08,5,"I love this place.  I've been a member for years.  I love the exhibits, which are fresh even for coming here every year.As a member I spent the night here once.  It was worth the price.  You should do it.Don't eat here.  There's better food nearby.  Do the in/out thing and have a nice sitdown meal between wandering the wonderful exhibits."
2278,2012-08-15,5,"Ok so, I am SUUUPER biased because this place holds a huuuuuge place in my heart now. A trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium with my boyfriend years ago when we first started dating launched my love for this place. I had known this aquarium for years before as I would frequent with family.... but things are just so much different when you're with your bestfriend! This place gets so packed. It is ridiculous. I really wonder where all these people park because I swear the parking lot was empty when we got there a few weeks ago! And we went on a weekday. The Open Sea exhibit is out of this world gorgeous. I have had the behind the scenes tour with my old job a few years back... and it's amazing to see it from up top. On our latest trip... I was beyond surprised and shocked to have my boyfriend propose to me in front of the exhibit. It was not only perfect since we're both marine life freaks... but we have always loved visiting the aquarium in the past decade. You definitely have to allot a few hours here to check the place out! The octopus is freakin mind blowing. I can stand there for hours admiring that guy. And the jelly exhibit. And the sea horses! AND the sunfish! And the sea turtles. AMAZINGGGG.You know how you always see those commercials on the aquarium advertising ""Love is in the air"" for the seahorse exhibit???? Yeah... it's true :)"
2279,2015-07-08,5,"The prettiest jellyfishies ever! Super cute sea otters. Don't come to this aquarium expecting to see lots of big whales, sharks, and teeeeth. This is more low-key... a nice aquarium to walk around and relax in... maybe walk off that food coma after a big meal."
2280,2014-12-30,5,"I've been a member of the aquarium for probably 15 years now, and I always love it, but this review is a little different - this past November my now wife and I got married at the aquarium. We started the process about a year ago - first finding out that they do weddings, then working with Susan the events manager to book our day. Susan was great, walking us through the entire process and all the paperwork, menu options, what is and isn't allowed, etc. We were glad that she wasn't phased that we were a same-sex couple, and we later found out that there have been several same-sex weddings at the aquarium already. My wife and I play brass instruments and we wanted to have a brass quintet play for our ceremony. The aquarist was concerned about the lower instruments, so Susan arranged for us to play tuba/trombone duets for the sardines to test it out. :) She could've just told us it wasn't allowed, but she went to great efforts to accommodate our needs.We were sad when Susan left the events team in June, and there was a little confusion while they found her replacement, but it was worth the wait. We ended up having Amy as our replacement event coordinator. Amy was FABULOUS!! She walked us through all of the details, took copious notes, and took care of everything. We even changed the ceremony entrance the day before the wedding because Amy had a better idea than the one we originally agreed to - she didn't stop thinking just because we'd settled on something.The night of the event was amazing. The aquarium closed at 6pm and the wedding started at 7pm. In just one hour, the team of ""magic elves"" (for lack of a better thing to call them) completely transformed the open sea wing. Although it was technically her day off, Amy came in for the early part of the evening to make sure everything was OK. She introduced us to her security staff leads and to Claudia, the event manager (who also took great care of us at the Clement, where she's the restaurant manager). The aquarium staff took care of everything perfectly. We felt like royalty, being escorted behind the scenes from our getting ready area to the ceremony area. The staff had ear pieces for their walkie talkies, and as we came up the stairs outside one of the staff that was waiting for us spoke into the headset, ""We have the brides. The brides are ready to enter."" We had a magical ceremony in the sardine rotunda, followed by a cocktail hour in the jellies exhibit. The staff set up the bar in front of the big sea nettle tank - our guests were floored! The food was absolutely amazing and perfectly cooked. The reception setup in front of the big open sea tank was phenomenal. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. Our guests raved about everything - the ambience, the food, the service - and of course the amazing sea life. It was an epic evening. Another special call-out to Claudia, who personally waited on us hand and foot - bringing us small plates of appetizers to make sure we each got an opportunity to sample each kind. She kept our champagne flutes full, and made sure we had time to sit and eat during the reception. She also quickly handled when we had an extra guest we weren't expecting.Best of all, the rental fee for the aquarium for an evening is comparable to many higher-end hotels and wineries in the area (less expensive that quite a few, actually), and the money goes right back into their education and research programs. We highly recommend the aquarium not just for a day visit, but to rent out for the evening for any special occasion that calls for a unique venue. The catering fees were separate, and those go to the aquarium's catering company. The food was comparably priced for a wedding. There is a cake cutting fee, but they already charge you for dessert. If you're not having their dessert, that per-person dessert fee just becomes the cake cutting fee, so it's a wash. Their default wine choices are pretty expensive and we didn't love the selection. The corkage fee ($25/bottle) is steep, but can still be more economical than buying their wines."
2281,2015-08-08,2,"The aquarium itself is awesome. But going there during the weekend it's just a huge mess. There are far too many people inside, and far too many kids pushing everyone around. If you go there, go during the week or something."
2282,2013-01-18,4,"Great resource.  Membership can pay off with 2 visits/year.  Free wifi, though as usual not that easy to connect from smartphones, which are presumably the main way that visitors would use the network.Free parking, if you don't mind the walk up David Ave as far as Belden."
2283,2015-02-06,4,"The exhibits are very informational and exciting, and the views are phenomenal!"
2284,2016-01-06,4,The aquarium itself is fantastic. This was my second time visiting and I brought my husband with me to experience the magic. Unfortunately we decided go visit on January 2nd and there were so many people we could hardly walk the halls. Also a lot of people with really small children and big bulky strollers that they leave in the middle of the walk ways. Your best best is to go on a week day during the non-travel season. It is a pretty special place.
2285,2013-04-18,5,"Our two year old had been talking about the ""big fishies"" with excitement for nearly a week before we even went to visit the aquarium.  He had never been before, so I talked it up and did my best to get him excited.  When we did get there, there were so many people he was a little confused, but then we walked near the large three story kelp forest tank.  He got out of his stroller and just stared, and stared, and stared.  He never wanted to leave, and it was a great experience for us."
2286,2016-01-03,5,"We hadn't been to the aquarium in a few years, so took the kids (ages 15,12 and 12) and the best visit we've ever had.  We did the behind the scenes tour, and it was amazing.  Sandy was our guide and she had wonderful insight and was energetic to show us around.  With the kids now older, we arrived in the afternoon and it was PACKED, but by the time the tour was over, the places emptied and we stayed til closing.  We stood in front of the ocean exhibit, almost by ourselves."
2287,2015-11-14,5,"If I lived any closer, I'd be a member.  (My family and I were out-of-town guests). It was my second visit, and the hypnotic nature of the exhibits, seen from winding, darkish hallways, left me a little confused as to what I had and hadn't seen by the end of this exploration. I loved the plaques and flip-books by the sea otter exhibit, because watching the animals play with toys, dive, and apparently show off made me intensely curious as to their history and their daily routines.  Another thing I loved was the opportunity for different viewing angles, since marine wildlife lives its life in 3D.  One octopus had spread itself against  the wall of its tubular tank, meaning that if you circled the tank you got to see its tentacles and suckers on one side, its dorsal view from the other, and it was invisible from the rest of the way around.  The open sea exhibit was like an alien world."
2288,2015-08-29,4,A must see when you are in Monterey.  Very nice.   Beautiful location.  Make sure you speak with a guide to make sure you didn't miss anything.
2289,2015-06-22,5,"Love this place! They update their exhibits every once in awhile.  This is a ""must see"" whenever you go to Monterey.  And the sea otter exhibit is always the most popular.  This place is also VERY busy so try and come early and avoid the holidays if possible.  Yes the price is a bit steep but it goes towards the care/feeding of all the animals.  Great ""ooh ahh"" experience for both children and adults who are children at heart."
2290,2015-12-29,5,Excellent for families. Buy your tickets ahead of time to avoid lines. Exceptional exhibits very busy and crowded during the holidays try off season
2291,2012-08-02,4,"We are getting used to having a monthly fix-our visit to the Aquarium to see what is new.  But our favorite Aquarium is having some issues just because it is so wonderful it is being loved to death.  It was the ultimate experience 10-15 years ago, but has gotten so crowded on any regular day  that one can hardly move around.  If we weren't members and so could go on member's nights when the crowds thin out, it would be a real problem. The everchanging exhibits are superb, the views are great, the whole experience is out of this world.  Now it needs to be doubled in size.  Hmm-I guess that is not possible financially, so we will just have to continue to buy annual passes and support this incredible place.  If the crowds are getting to you, then this seems to be the only viable solution we know of.   The new jelly exhibit alone is worth a repeat visit and the interactive exhibits for the kids are amazingly creative. This would easily be a five star spot if they could come up with additional member-only times to visit."
2292,2013-04-08,5,We enjoy our time here. Yeah it can get crowded at times but I really do like the exhibits. The kid zone (splash zone?) upstairs is real cute and fun for little ones.
2293,2012-07-09,5,"Two favorite things are always on exhibit here: jellyfish and sea horses. They have some really awesome extra exhibits about jellyfish - which I love. I love seeing jellyfish and their beauty. I will admit, I'm a little kid at heart when it comes to museums. I want to touch everything and see everything. Take pictures...of everything. The giant tank they have has a sea turtle, tuna and most of all - sharks. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Sometimes I think I can live in an aquarium. Jellyfish are definitely something I want in my aquarium room in my dream house. Parking isnt too bad - $10 the entire day? Awesome. Much better than places in SF.Ticket lines are long - so buy them online and print out the tickets - avoid the long times and take more pictures of fish."
2294,2014-06-06,2,"For the price you pay and what they offer its not wroth the price to deal with screaming kids parents yelling instead of walking to who ever they were yelling at/to. We watched a ""feeding"" and all it was, was some fish flakes kind of like you would feed your goldfish. The only plus side was the otters (when you could see them) and the 2 cool jellyfish exhibits. The ""touch a ray"" would have been cool if the rays weren't stacked on top of each other hiding in the far corner not even swimming. In my view drop the price and have more exhibits that aren't about seaweed and kelp we don't care about the plants of the sea we want to see cool fish sharks turtles otters and jellyfish! Also one last vent then I will be done...get rid of the video fish tanks this isnt the 80's that shit is week fill it with sea LIFE not plants or videos!!"
2295,2012-11-26,4,"This place is getting a 4 from me cuz its a lot smaller than I remembered probably cuz I was 10 years old last time I came. It was crowded, SO MANY strollers.The things I did not like were:-no touching of the sting rays (there were only 2)-the otters were gone!!!-to many dumb thing like fake jelly fish posters etc-price for adults for 2 ppl over $65 bucks rip off!"
2296,2012-06-14,4,"This is definitley a fun place to go to, and bring your student ID for a student discount. Looking at the creatures of the sea is truly captivating. They have pengiuns, touch pools, sea turtles, sharks, sea horses, fishies, jelly fishes, etc. This place is a great place for family bonding time, a date, and a great learning experience. You come out of the bay aquarium with a greater respect and knowledge of the seaworld."
2297,2015-12-18,4,"Difficulty parking and a half hour line to get in started this day off with a less than great experience but the aquarium itself delivered with stunning exhibits, informative staff, and solid education. Imho it's better for families with ages 3-6 kids than anyone else as there are very basic exhibits and child size things everywhere (with corresponding loud shrieking). The behind the scenes tour was neat and well run. I was a bit bored in some of the areas for being mostly short  non story forming text and couldn't get in to the big tank feeding but would recommend it for a solid day trip of wandering around with a friend despite it."
2298,2013-07-11,4,"From Jellyfishes and seahorses, to sharks and and seaturtles, this decent sized zoo for marine life has a lot of exhibits to see, and plenty of activities to keep your little one busy in their splash zone.   Since it can get super crowded, I do suggest becoming a member if you don't live extremly far away so your little one doesn't need to be rushed through the whole building to squeeze all their seeing and learning experience in only a couple of hours, which you need to also squeeze in lunch and potty breaks.We purchased the annual membership so we can take our little toddler a couple of times this year, which allows us to stroll through the exhibits more leisurely without stressing out our little booger, and we're a little over an hour away.It's also tucked beach side, so you can also take the little one to the beach to see all the little sand scrabs he or she has seen, and also enjoy the nice little fisherman's wharf.   There's also a huge playground area down the street up the block where McD's is at."
2299,2012-11-05,5,"I love this aquarium!!!! I've been coming here since I was little, and it never gets old!The aquarium is huge, and they have an always changing exhibit in the east wing, which keeps things new & interesting ! Last time I came, they have the Jellies Experience, and though they already have a jellies exhibit upstairs, this is like an expansion on that! Plus, they have really beautiful decorations in the new exhibit, just look at the detailing on the doors! A few years back, they even had a shark exhibit with a touch pool! It's possible to go through the whole aquarium in half a day if you're in a rush, but I love spending the whole day here! They have a cafe, where you can enjoy lunch looking out on the bay, and several 'movies' that they show in their theater! The aquarium is just really beautiful!! Definitely my favorite :))"
2300,2015-06-05,4,"So my memories of this place must be foggy because I remember it being so much bigger and amazing when I was younger.  This is still a pretty amazing aquarium and they have done some refreshes over the years, but it seems like something is still missing.  Can't put my finger on it, but it's not the 5 star experience I remember"
2301,2015-09-13,5,Had a blast with my family cannot wait to return! Loved every moment. My daughter already wants to come back! The jelly fish area was so amazing!
2302,2012-08-02,3,"I was underwhelmed when I visited, but that may be because my expectations were too high from seeing how it's so lauded on both Yelp and from national reviews.Anyways, it was good, but I don't anticipate going back. There were many people, but what really got me was how small it is. Is it laid out well? Yes, wonderfully, and there is a lot of information too, which I think is fabulous. However, there really isn't that much in there that I was wowed by.The sea horse exhibit was interesting, as were the jellyfish. My favorite part was watching the school of fish (can't remember what they were) in the open ocean tank. There's a second story that you can sit in that allows you a better vantage point and has less crowds. I personally like the large exhibit at the Atlanta Aquarium better, but the school of fish was cool to watch.Overall, it was a good experience, but because of the price I don't anticipate going back personally. I wish I'd driven down through Big Sur rather than spent my afternoon at the aquarium, but that's me."
2303,2013-09-11,5,"I have to admit this is the best aquarium I have been to. It is huge and there is a lot to look at and learn about. We saw the Open Sea feeding in the morning (so if you want to see that, go in the morning). Very informative and interesting. I enjoy supporting zoo's and aquariums but if you're on a budget after just paying to get in, bring your own food. Pricey little cafe but they do have a good selection. Great visit in Monterey!"
2304,2015-08-06,5,"This place is my favorite place in the world. My family and I always try to come here at least once a year, the exhibits are amazing and so full of awesome information. I can't pick my favorite, between the Open Sea (formerly the Outer Bay), The Jellyfish of all kinds, the sea otters & penguins...the list goes on & on. I could stay and watch the jellyfish forever if I could. My kids love going back to see the hammer head shark and the otters. The price has gone up but it's totally worth every penny. Plus the admission you pay goes towards the care of the animals so it's a win win :) Can not wait to go back again."
2305,2015-12-06,3,Overall it's a fun time but not a good value for your money. $40 a person is a bit much for just a mediocre aquarium.
2306,2010-11-12,5,"NOTE:  For all you shark lovers like me:  The outer bay is closed until Summer 2011.  That means that you won't be able to see the big sharks, the sunfish, or the tuna until then...  :(My favorite parts of the aquarium have always been the sharks, the jellyfish, and the bat ray touch pool.  The bat rays often shy away in the corner, but if you're lucky you'll get to feel one!There is a flamingo exhibit up right now that is pretty darn cool as well.I have been coming here since I was a little kid and I love this aquarium.  The theater shows, live feedings, and informational sessions are great.A++++++++++  SOOOO FUNN!!!"
2307,2015-10-17,5,Great adventure! We spent a half day exploring and learning new things. We will be back!
2308,2015-09-07,5,Best aquarium  in the world. The otter exhibit is fun and fantastic. I take my friends here a lot
2309,2015-09-06,5,"By far, one of my favorite places to visit! The adventures they have planned for visitors on a daily basis educates using fun and naturally organic strategies. A bit pricey for a family of four but extraordinary for a family of one. Go alone if you really want to take it all in."
2310,2013-08-02,5,This was probably the best experience with an aquarium I've ever had.  We had so much fun.  The people were very nice and had a wealth of knowledge to share.  There was something for all of us.  My 13 year old daughter and I LOVED the sea otters.  My husband was thoroughly impressed by the Jelly-fish.  We were all amazed by the giant squid.  The sardine history was fun.  The views were fantastic.  It was a bit crowded but was totally worth dealing with.  A bit on the expensive side... But I don't regret spending the money on it one bit.
2311,2010-11-22,5,"As always, when I have friends in town, this is worth the drive every time. From the otters to the flamingos to the jelly fish to the penguins to the sea horses and dragons, this place is (as Brian Wilson would say) ""Epic"". This weekend was a special sea birds weekend and they really came through. (something about watching a penguin walk down a red carpet just kills me). Definitely check the website to see what's going on. (and if you have kids, look for the arts and crafts activity that day) No kids? well it's also fun to watch your friends turn into 10 year-olds when they get to touch the bat rays and the starfish in the tide pool area. The shark and sunfish area is closed right now til sometime in 2011, but the jelly fish are still open in that section (which I personally like even more)PS: if you live in SF, just get the season pass. it pays for itself on your second visit."
2312,2012-10-02,5,"Amazeballs! FIshies of all kinds! Jellies, Seahorses, Sea Turtles, Sharks, Penguins....They have special areas for kids and babies too! We particularly liked the dark rooms  with the giant glass. It's a good place for your baby to rest since it's so dark and cool. You can have a seat up against the wall and just watch the peaceful ocean and creatures behind the glass.I wish our daughter were old enough to appreciate what just happened this weekend but we will take her again when she is older. What a great place, especially if you are an ocean lover. It's just phenomenal.*Moms and Dads* .... The changing tables are built in to the counters and are fully stocked with liners. They are also in their own separate corridor of the ladies room so you are not just ""out there"" while everyone else is walking by. They really put some thought into the design for us parents. It's a very comfortable place to change your kid.We will be back!"
2313,2015-07-27,4,"Nice place to spend the day. Make sure to check the website before you go, this can help you plan your visit, know what to do, where and when to go throughout the whole day."
2314,2010-05-14,3,"""The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man trying to return soup at a deli!""False enlightenment at Monterey Bay - great information, but dumbed down a tad past the point where an educated adult would garner meaningful education.  However, given the diversity of exhibits and wealth of elementary education, Monterey Bay is perfect for kids and aspiring junior Marine Biologists...""I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you, at that moment, I was a marine biologist!"""
2315,2012-08-09,4,"A wonderful place! This wasn't so great when I was a kid, but boy have things changed. This place has numerous different exhibits, including hands-on stuff such as petting bat rays and so forth, as well as penguin and sea-otter feedings (which is hands-on for the staff). All the exhibits are nice, but noteworthy are the seahorse and dragons, the penguins and sea otters;but the jellyfish exhibit is just awesome. Despite all that, I'm a big fan of the gigantic tanks filled with lots of different fish, sharks, and starfish.The Aquarium is not as big as most people think, contrary to those reviewers who say it is HUGE, so many leave feeling underwhelmed. But there is a lot to experience and much information to be learned. The Aquarium is laid-out and organized exceptionally well, making it  easy to navigate. As you might expect, the gift shop is an over-priced tourist trap, but it still sells some cool stuff; they also have important information with respect to conservation.On your B-Day, they will give you a little gift (emphasis on little); but, hey, it's a nice gesture. WARNING: DO NOT go on the weekend, at least during Spring and Summer. The Aquarium will already be fairly busy even on weekdays, especially during the scheduled feedings (unless you show up very early, it will be next to impossible to get a good vantage point to watch, say, the otters get fed)."
2316,2015-06-17,5,"You could spend several hours here and not see everything. I visited the aquarium today with my husband and two young sons. We all loved it. There is something for each age group. The view is spectacular. The exhibits are amazing. The docents were very helpful. My 4 year old did NOT want to leave, even though his eyelids were drooping from being so exhausted after a fun filled morning (just over 4 hours). I wish we lived closer, as this would definitely be a place I'd buy a yearly pass to. Sadly, I live in San Diego, and this place makes the Birch Aquarium look like a puny fish tank."
2317,2015-07-21,5,One of the best aquariums in the world. Maybe the best. Make sure you check out the otters and the million gallon tank. The food is pretty good as well.
2318,2010-09-27,5,"How could I fail not reviewing this place right away? Its the biggest aquarium I've ever been to!  I got to pet a stingray! (they nipped the stingers of course) I love sea creatures that's why I am a scuba diver but at the same time I love seafood! Specially crabs. Dungeness crabs!  I was staring at a weird-looking crab, the kind with spikes all over his body, and said to myself ""I wonder what it taste like..""  Apparently, an elder looking man overheard and said to me, ""you should not think that way about them..."".  Don't worry, I am not going to grab a fish net and scoop him out of the tank...lol.Its a great place indeed. They even have slides and other games for toddlers to play with. My favorite display is the leafy seadragon. I was mesmerized by its beauty. See photo that I took if you have not seen one yet."
2319,2015-08-23,5,One of the better aquariums I've ever been to. Does a very good job of education without being boring. I am a grown man and found myself having more fun at the kid section of the aquarium than I would care to admit. Also the major tank in the aquarium is amazing with three different levels to view from and a kelp forest reaching from the bottom of the tank all the way to the top.
2320,2015-08-22,4,"I have been coming here for years. Great exhibits, especially the jellies and the touch pools. It gets crowded in summer so prefer to come during the off peak times. We have a yearly pass so we come often. The food at the cafeteria is actually decent. The sea otters are always fun and there is a nice play area for kids."
2321,2017-01-08,5,I love this place. It's by far one of my favorite aquariums. My husband and I went by ourselves and will be taking our girls this February. Definitely worth our money.
2322,2012-06-12,3,"Came here on the wifey's bday weekend and to get out the area for my sons graduation. Came here with a few family members who also wanted to celebrate with us. Sometimes getting away from San Jose just to hang out with family is the best thing to do to get some family time in.This was my second visit here and it was just the same as my first one. I really didn't get a kick out of it too much (might be because this place is more of a kids educational type thing) but it really seemed like the kids didn't have too much fun either. This place is more of a field trip visit kinda thing. This place was pretty expensive considering that the kids didn't have too much of a fun than they would if they were to drive a go kart for the very first time or maybe go to an arcade place like chuck e cheese. And probably would of spent 2 times less than this place.Overall this place is very educational and there is much to see here, from seahorses to exotic fish, sharks to sting rays and even turtles and jelly fishes. I do recommend people to come here because it is education and fun at the same time, but there are many other aquariums in the Bay Area so this probably isn't the main place I would recommend considering the price.I did upload a video on youtube of our experience there, check it out youtube.com/watch?v=YaUW… the video is on our whole day experience, but if you want to only view our Monteery Bay Aquarium experience, jump to 1:08"
2323,2010-09-11,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!It may be small, but you know what they say......wonderful things come in small packages......like I said it is a bit small but I had a full whole day here and I want to go back, unfortunately it's located about 9 hours from where I live :$.My favorite the kelp forest (the reason I wanted to visit this place) and the splash zone, where my inner child came out to play!!!! And everything for just $30. Another thing the jellyfish are magnificent and the otters are so cute!!!If you are in the area, even if your are just passing by, try to visit this place you won't regret it!!!!!"
2324,2011-07-16,5,"This was hands-down the most amazing aquarium i have ever had the pleasure of going to.  The sea horse exhibit was extensive, informative and incredible and the wave-simulator and shark tank were exciting!  I fell in love with the otters and even had a tasty salad in the restaurant!  I can't say enough great things about this aquarium, it's a must-see.My one recommend - if you want to avoid the masses of squealing children get there early.Enjoy!"
2325,2013-11-15,5,"Best aquarium this side of the Mississippi. Maybe even both sides of the Mississippi!One thing that makes this place unique is its dedication to helping YOU be part of the solution to the problem the oceans are facing. Love it's programs, shows, and workshops too!"
2326,2016-01-17,5,"A wonderful place to explore with your family, friends or even yourself.The staff members - from admissions to the gift shop -  are amazing and the animal exhibits are not only humane but extremely fascinating to observe. My family and I learn so much each time we visit the Aquarium. Please keep up the excellent work, Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
2327,2012-11-14,4,"This is a beautiful aquarium. My favorites were the jelly fish area and the large tank with sharks, sea turtles, yellow tail tuna, and schools of fish (millions of fishes. it's really cool). There's a lot to see and the exhibits are nice. The only thing I didn't like about it is the descriptions of the animals have limited data. I want to know if things are poisonous, what region they are from, where they usually live, etc. I did like how certain exhibits had people telling us about specific animals such as the pools where you can touch things. Keep in mind this is a aquarium so it's not FUN or anything. It's just cool to see. If you want something really fun and exciting you won't like this or any other aquarium, museum, art center, etc. Kids will love it here."
2328,2015-08-14,5,"We LOVE the aquarium.  Even though we have been here many, many times, we love coming back.  Of course, it's best when their secial exhibits change (like sea horses or tentacles), but even if the exhibits don't change, it's a great place to spend a few hours.  We always learn something new when we come.  Plus, we love supporting an organization that does benefical things for the environment and wildlife.  A MUST SEE if you are in the Monterey area!The cafe is definitely on the expensive side but they offer some good food!"
2329,2015-11-09,5,Wonderful! Great staff! Kids love it here! so many attractions!
2330,2014-11-09,5,"This is one of the places that we always visit when we come to SF visiting relatives.   It is the best value if you get those city passes.   It is a drive from SF but well-worth the trip.   The ""shows"" were educational and the staff are generally friendly and helpful.   Come early and you can enjoy the surrounding areas for food and shopping."
2331,2014-04-27,4,"You can't bring food or drinks into the aquarium so order in the cafe what you can finish quickly.  Try to come on a day other than the weekend, as it is usually quite packed and will degrade your experience."
2332,2011-08-09,5,I just finished a week long teaching inservice at Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was fantastic! The aquarium is a great place and you can tell all the employees love their job. It has soo many exhibits and cool things to see and do. They also allow for exit and reentry if you go there for the day so you get to explore Cannery Row and Fishermans Wharf. This is just a must see if you are in Norther California.
2333,2015-09-17,5,This is a great little aquarium and I must visit especially if you have kids and want to teach them about the ocean and show them ocean creatures. Last time I was there I got rushed through my friends you want to go somewhere else so I didn't get to see the newest things but it's always fun and it's not a huge aquarium but you can make a day of it when you add in shopping and restaurants in the neighborhood
2334,2010-06-03,4,"It's been nearly 25 years since my last trip to the aquarium--and my confession is that it's not as big as I remembered it. Then again, I was 3 feet tall at that time and perceptions change. :)I've been wanting to visit again to see all the ocean life and got the opportunity to do so this past Memorial weekend. By the time we got there I was a bit concerned that we wouldn't have enough time to see everything as we were stuck in some major traffic from San Jose (3 hours!) but found that 3 hours we had there was ample time.My favorites were:-- The Jellyfish!!!-- Kelp Forest-- Huge tank with the Tunas, Sharks, Rays, and Sardines I was a little disappointed with the ""Touch pools"" but then again, if I was a marine animal, I'm not sure I'd want all these humans grabbing and petting me either :)Also, if you're looking for the Sea Horses, be sure to go on the right side of the Aquarium. We caught a small tank upstairs with only 5 Sea Horses and thought that was it! 2 minutes before closing we stumbled upon the real exhibit which was MUCH larger and cooler. Bummer!Tickets are a bit pricey at $30/adult. But, if you're looking for something fun to do in the area for a few hours I would definitely recommend it."
2335,2012-08-06,5,"Came here with the family and this aquarium stands alone at the top! I seriously never knew how fascinating marine life would be. When I entered the aquarium, I thought I would be done and out in about 30 minutes. I mean what else is there to see besides penguins and fish? But we ended up staying there for around two hours until closing and came back the next morning. The best part--how interactive and hands on this aquarium is for kids! The shows entertaining, the feedings are so much fun, the exhibits are colorful, clean and beautiful, the staff are knowledgeable and love educational moments. Throughout the aquarium you can walk outside and get some fresh air (& escape the crowds) and look out into Monterey Bay.They had tons of exhibits like the Sea Otters, The Jellies Experience, The Secret Life of Seahorses, The Open Sea, Penguins and even a little theater. Our favorites were definitely the Jellies Experience, the Open Sea & the Seahorses. You can also find Nemo & Dory here :) Tips:Buying the 2-day pass was the same price as 1-day. We bought our tickets from the hotel room which was much cheaper than buying it at the Aquarium plus you can skip the long lines and walk right in. $10.00 for all day parking was not bad at allYou can bring bottled water insideOverall - very satisfied and my daughter had an Awesome time :)"
2336,2007-06-08,4,"Hundreds of tiny, sticky chubby fingers, pulling on levers.Banging on life-size displays of fish.Their ruddy, crumb caked faces pressed up against huge tanks.As a massive giant Bluefin Tuna, surrounded by a school of tiny fish sidles past them.The tiny chubby fingers clench up.The excited, yet scared faces attached to the the fingers swing around to face an exhausted looking mom, carrying two bags packed with bottles, crackers, blankets, and napkins. ""Look Mommy!!!!!!!!!!! Big Fish!!!!! Look Look!.""She feigns a tired smile. Two other mothers turn to her and sigh.All three of the women thinking...""At least they're happy....occupied. How much longer till bedtime....""The three tired woman all look up and not expecting it, they lose their breath for a moment, as a giant Sunfish glides past them - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im…Their eyes widen. Mesmerized. Looking at that strange creature in the tank, they are taken back to their childhood. Countless moments spent in a small classroom, drawing goldfish and fish on scrap paper.  Struggling to get the proportions right, the smooth side silhouettes, and the fins.  And here before them is a creature that exceeds even that which their childhood imagination could fathom. It is staring right at them. Natural, huge, strange and real.And it makes the hour car ride, long day and admission fees worth it.A suprise that doesn't involve baking birthday cakes, clowns, and late nights. It's definitely worth it.Monterey Aquarium has managed to capture all ages with their beautiful, informative, and well laid out tanks and displays. They bring exceptional color to the underwater world with aquarium displays ranging from Kelp Forest, to Sea Otters, to Giant  Octopus, to Sandy Shore, to Rocky Shore, to Outer Bay, to Penguins, to Jelly-Fish, to a tremendous outdoor view of the bay, where you can even whale watch. At one point in 2004 they even housed a Great White Shark for 14 days!The layout of the space is impressive, clean, and organized, not cold and sterile like some aquariums. It's well lit, colorful, and geared for families, which explains the countless kids running EVERYWHERE in the space. The penguin and otter exhibits are well worth checking out. The otter exhibit being particularly engaging once the sea otters become more lively during the afternoon, after feeding.  But the highlight of the trip was the...The jelly-fish exhibits. They were unbelievable. Ethereal. Seeing such mystical creatures up close made me realize how important it is to support places like the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Everyday it is sparking interest in young kids and propelling them to learn more nature, and even nudging them into ocean-life professions.It stands as a constant reminder of why we need to protect the ocean, watch what fish we eat, and why familiarizing our youth and ourselves with the perpetually intriguing underwater world is a huge and much needed step in the right direction...."
2337,2013-05-28,5,Love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! We are members and go a few times a year.We recently attended the Cooking for Solutions Gala and weekend for the first time. What an amazing time we had. Already looking forward to going again next year!
2338,2015-09-14,3,This is a great place to go when you just want to get away from land and start looking at what's in the sea I love the whale exhibits they are amazing only problem is this place is way too overpopulated you can lose friends very fast but overall I had a good time
2339,2009-06-11,5,"Took a trip to Monterey Aquarium over the weekend.  Upon arrival there were friendly staff outside willingly to answer any questions as well as direct you to ticket sales.  I was able to check out the following exhibitions:* Touch Pools/Splash Zone: These interactive exhibits were educational and fun as you were able to touch bat rays, numerous types of starfishes, sea cucumbers, kelp, crabs, etc.  The volunteers overseeing these exhibits were also very knowledgeable and answered all questions.* Coastal Birds:  Was wondering why none of these birds were flying around, but after seeing one bird missing a wing I assume some of these are rescue birds that have found sanctuary here. * Penguins: Always fun to watch, it was cool and amusing to see them waddling up and down the rocks and diving into the water for a swim. * Jellies Gallery:  This was one of my favorite exhibits as the only time I see jelly fishes are the dead ones on the beach or shredded on a plate. But here they were alive and full of color, definitely could've pulled up a chair and watched for hours. (static.px.yelp.com/bphot…)* The Secret Lives of Seahorses: This was an amazing exhibit as they had numerous species, some of which I've never seen before. They also had sea dragons, pipehorses, and pipefish. One of my favorite's were the uber stylish leafy sea dragons. (static.px.yelp.com/bphot…).  * Outer Bay: Different species of sharks, tuna, dolphinfish, rays, etc. swimming around and around.  I was waiting for one of the sharks to attack and eat something but it didn't happen.* Wild About Otters:  Cool exhibit with 3 otters swimming around and playing with each other.  There was also a second display with a single otter, he/she looked kinda pissed it was by itself making a noise, maybe mating call? not sure.  (static.px.yelp.com/bphot…)* Tide Pool Deck:  This outdoor area was spectacular. Beautiful views along with numerous telescopes visitors can use to spot seals, fishes, and birds. Overall an excellent experience and one of the best Aquariums I've been to.  Now I know why my friend takes her family here every month.  They have $120 memberships for entire year of free admission which includes two adults plus children or grandchildren ages 3-21.  Considering the single-day tickets are $29.95 it is definitely something to look into."
2340,2015-05-26,2,"Finally came here for the visit to see what this is all about. I don't know what is the big deal, but I can see everything here at California Academy of Science aquarium in San Francisco. I thought the place was not that big, but I did like the ocean view deck area for people to walk on. Other than that, I did not find this place super special. Also, it tends to get very very crowded. I think they are overpriced for the stuff they offered at this place. I don't recommend this place."
2341,2009-12-29,5,"[M]ona: 5 Stars[W]ayne: 5 Stars  Average: 5 Stars+ Nice Tourist Attraction+ Great Weekend Getaway+ For People All Ages+ Good Learning Experience+ Beautiful and Clean [W] Monterey in general is a great place just to get away for the weekend. It's close enough to Carmel if you want to take a 15 minute drive over for some shopping at independent stores and great restaurants as well. Me and Mona came here to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium and it was fantastic! There's so much to see at the Aquarium that sometimes it seems like it's never ending. What I like about the aquarium is that it's right on Cannery Row in Monterey. There's a lot of shopping and history that you can see everywhere. It definitely feels like a little homey town where you can just relax and not worry about anything. In the aquarium you can actually go outside to their patio area and overlook the bay. It's really a beautiful sight to see while you're there. Everything seems so pure and clean that it doesn't feel like a city at all. The aquarium is also very children friendly as well. On the lower level they have trained staff that can let you touch things such as star fish, some water plants and all that good stuff. It's also fun when you can see them feed the penguins as well because there's a guy that actually speaks on the microphone and tells you all about the penguins from their diets to where they're from and all. If you ever come to Monterey, it's definitely a good experience to visit the Monterey Bar Aquarium because you'll definitely be missing out if you don't!"
2342,2016-02-11,5,Such a fun place! They have everything there! I liked the fact that we could leave to grab food and come back! Definitely going back again.
2343,2015-08-02,5,"Get there early! If you are military buy your tickets from the NPS, ITT. Head over to the open sea feeding 45 mins before the show and get a seat upstairs. We saw humpbacked whales in the bay outside. After spending a few hours at the Aquarium, go kayaking!"
2344,2014-08-31,4,"I love sea animals and creatures! They have a wide variety of marine species, it's kept clean, staff is super friendly. I would buy tickets online so you don't have to wait in long lines; such a big hassle! It gets overcrowded but it's a great place to visit!"
2345,2009-07-31,5,"Just as we did last year, we headed within the first hour of it's opening on that Sunday morning.  No line at the ticket counter, and we were off to see the exhibits.  Still a fair amount of people that morning, but we still had a lot of stress-free exploring.  Basically, a very relaxing time of viewing the various tanks, and for the kids to play at the hands-on exhibits.New this year is the ""Secret Life of Seahorses"" exhibits.  To make room for this exhibit, I was concerned that many of my Jellyfish exhibits wouldn't be there.  Fear not, they were still there.  I'm so fascinated by the Jellyfish exhibits:  so relaxing and so soothing whenever I see them.  Probably also due to the lighting of the displays and the appropriate background music has a lot to do with it.The seahorse exhibit was very fascinating.  The Aquarium presented the different species of seahorses very well.  Never knew there were so many kinds and sizes of seahorses.Like last year, still a few people who don't know how to turn off the flash function of their cameras, and they're wondering why the octopus' are always hiding (even when they're signs out that say octopus' don't like flashes).But as it has been for me every year, I never grow tired of this Aquarium, and it still remains in my book the standard in innovative exhibits and their advocacy to preserve the ocean's ecology."
2346,2012-03-28,3,"I would give this aquarium five stars if it weren't for the hordes of unruly, rambunctious and loud children at every turn...even on a weekday. Sadly, the aquarium caters almost entirely to children, leaving adults who want to actually learn about marine life and enjoy the exhibits with any sense of calm feeling shortchanged. Far too many child-related exhibits and too many parents with gargantuan strollers treating it like an amusement park and not a world-class aquarium.The aquarium needs to also ban cameras...though flash photography is prohibited, nothing is done to enforce this rule...the flashes of light not only disrupt the experience in certain areas of the museum (like the jellies exhibit), but is also harmful to the animals. I suspect the same people who were letting their children scream at the top of their lungs were probably the same ones who insisted on taking blurry pictures with their cell phones (I guarantee you that other, more talented, photographers have already captured images of those same animals....it's called the Internet...use it). The positives about this aquarium? The jellies exhibit is magical, especially if you can enjoy it in relative peace (good luck with that). The new seahorse exhibit is also really great...such weird little creatures! And, my personal favorite, the sun fish. I have experienced both the jellies and the sun fish exhibits in peace and in chaos...and I can definitely say the children ruined the exhibit for me. It was a magical experience when enjoyed with reverence and awe...not so much when lights are flashing all around and the cacophony of high-pitched squeals, screams and nagging parents makes you want to gouge out your eyeballs with a fork. I probably won't be back to the aquarium until they raise ticket prices, thereby keeping the crowds down...or they  have an adults-only event. I would pay three or four times the regular ticket price to have a peaceful experience...otherwise, I'll just have to watch my favorites on the live web cams."
2347,2015-10-27,5,Probably one of the best Aquariums in the country. Definitely a must see in the Monterey Pennisula
2348,2010-11-05,5,I'm a huge fan of aquariums esp ones the size of apartments & houses. This place is truly enchanting & you'll be entertained & mesmerized for hours. The sea otters are darling & the sting ray pool...awesome! If you want a rad day w/ the gf or bf or your kids this place will def please everyone. I've had some of the best times here.
2349,2012-04-21,4,"I've been to Monterey before but never been to the aquarium. Someone told me, its not worth it. Anyways, that someone was wrong. We came here on my birthday. I was so excited like a little kid. I grew up near the water so you could imagine why this excites me. I've seen, swum and played with these fishes back home, except for the sharks. lolThis is a nice place for everyone to learn about aquatic animals. We had a great time! $33 for admission ticket (Adult)."

I'd give it a higher star rating for lower prices.As per their beautiful web site below is ticket and hours information.Adult $29.95 Child (3 thru 12) $17.95 Child (under 3) Free Student$27.95 Senior (65+) $27.95Regular Hours10 a.m.-6 p.m. DailyClosed Dec. 25 Summer (May 26-Sept. 1)9:30 a.m.-6 p.m. Summer Weekends(July 5-Sept. 1) Sat. & Sun.9:30 a.m.-8:00 p.m. Holidays9:30 a.m.-6 p.m."
2351,2015-10-26,5,"Great experience! Went twice in a four day span, Thursday was slower so we got to take our time, Saturday was really busy but still a great time. Definitely check it out if you go to Monterey."
2352,2013-03-07,5,"Just as I remembered it from when I was young. Surprisingly super packed still for Christmas eve when I went. I used my aunt's guest pass so it was free for me so I'm not sure what the prices are unfortunately (well, unfortunate for readers but for fortunate for me :p) There's two floors and it's probably more exciting as a child. But I love aquariums. My favorite is the huge aquarium with the hammerhead sharks. So scary. Even big harmless fish like tuna is still scary to me. There's areas for touching such as stingrays or starfish. Remember to wash your hands!Even if you don't like the fish, the views outside are breathtaking. They even set up those binoculars so you can see otter or other wildlife out there in the ocean. An amazing stroll down memory lane."
2353,2015-10-24,2,"The aquarium was a great experience, but let me tell you about the restaurant. My fiance and I had lunch at the restaurant. He ordered the burger and has been throwing up all day. It was either spoiled or contaminated. This never happened to him before. So in the future, we will stay away from that restaurant."
2354,2010-01-16,5,"I am sure a 731st review is not necessary...but I was so impressed with this place I just had to!! We lucked out, and it was not crowded at all...Friday lite! I think the ticket price is fair...it was so clean, and all of the exhibits were spotless.  If you have AAA you can get advance tickets for a few bucks less.As a lifelong ""bayarean"", I traditionally skip the tourist spots...but I am so glad we went here....one of the most beautiful places I have ever been!! The seahorse exhibit was magical, as was the kelp forest, and the jelly fish. I could go on, and on! The otters were so fun to watch, plus great places for the kiddies, too!!I learned allot, and would gladly come back."
2355,2014-09-28,5,"my family and I go here every summer while growing up, and let me tell you, this place is amazing. you really have to go and experience this for yourself to truly understand lol. I took my husband for his first time and he was in awe! we were probably in there for a good 3-4 hours. Although it is every pricey, its all worth it. my husband loved it so much, im sure if we lived nearby, he'd probably have season passes. cant wait to visit again!"
2356,2009-11-08,4,"We went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium on Sun 11/8/09.  It's best for locals to go when the tourist are gone.  We got there after 10am.  We parked in a garage off Water St which charges money to park - we paid $15 for 5 1/2 hr maximum $18.We saw:Penguin exhibit feeding at 10:30am - there's African Penguins so the same as SF Cal Academy of Science.  It's on the 2nd Fl.  If you're close to the window they ask you to move 3 ft & sit on the floor, so if u get there early sit on the 2 benches.Outer Bay Exhibit feeding 11am Tues, Thurs, Sat & Sun- we went to the lower level and we had to stand to see them.  Maybe it's better on the 2nd Fl.Kelp Forest Exhibit feeding - 11:30 & 4p.  They have someone on the outside talking we had Michelle, Chuck was the diver.  Chuck hand feed the sharks squid & smelt.  If on the lower level you can sit on the carpet or on the benches or allow the stairwell.  2nd Fl standing only.  We were on the 2nd Fl.We also saw Mysteries of the Deep in the Auditorium 2pm.  It's a silent film and the lady narrates.  Ok, we did fall asleep a bit.See Otter Exhibit feeding 1:30pm.  Stand in the center windows.  We were on the far Rt window on only one was close for us to see.  Center has best views of them doing their eating & training.  Lasted like 5 mins.Sea Horse exhibit was ok - We liked it.  Kinda small exhibit.  Things in there: Weedy Sea Dragon; Pipefish; Lined Seahorse; Leafy Sea Dragon; Pacific Seahorse; Potberry Seahorses; Dwarf Seahorse; Banded Pipefish; Longsnout Seahorse; Yellow Seahorse; Alligator Pipefish; White Seahorse.  Now thru 2012.Hovden Cannery - about canning sardines in Monterey, John Steinbeck & Ed Ricketts.  I still need to read Cannery Row & Tortilla Flat.Bat Ray touching pool - B. touched one, said it was smooth, no spine.  don't grab or scatch -it scares the rays (sign said).See the aviary birds & blackfooted penguins before 5pm - that's when they go to sleep.Octopus in Ocean's Edge - just clings to window, boring.  Other things in that area: Sheep Crab; Wolf-eel & Lingcod; Sea Pen (cool); Flat Fish (cool); Sand Dollars (cool).Portola Cafe & Restaurant looked good.Pizza, sandwiches & soup (Lt side) $5.75 slice/$8.50 sandwiches; grill, salad & soup (Rt side).Small cafe for coffee, cookies, etc in the main area to the left of the Cafe.They have many gift shops.Hrs: 10a-6p daily except Christmas!  Summer (Memorial Day-Labor Day) & holiday hrs: 9:30am-6pm; Sat & Sun from July 5-Labor Day until 8pm.Prices:Adults $29.95 (18-64 & not in college)Child $17.95 (3-12)Sr 65+ & students (13-17 or in college) $27.95 Two hr drive from Fremont to Monterey each way.PS: You can bring in your own food, you just can't eat or drink in the Aquarium.  I brought a backpack & it wasn't checked.   Eating outside is fine.  Water is available in the Cafe.Coming Spring March 29, 2010: Hot Pink Flamingos.  Why flamingos in an aquarium?

2357,2012-05-26,4,I went there with my 2 teen age kids and had a great time.  Getting discounted tickets from AAA office was a little help to pay not so cheap admission.   Not to mention watching the colorful fishes and sea weeds I was happy to see that they added new building and sections.It's been almost 10 years since I visited last time.  The section about pollution due to plastics was very awakening in this time of earth for all of us.   Good place to spend a day with family and friends.
2358,2013-09-03,5,How can you go to Monterey and not go to the Aquarium?Yes it is a little pricey but it is worth it. Even if you've been here before you can come back they are always changing and updating exhibits. My new favorite is the Jellyfish you feel like you stepped back into the 70's.  Most of the negative reviews seem to be about the parking yes that sucks but is the same problem wherever you go so just be prepared to pay $15 for parking but maybe just go and make a day out of it by visiting a local restaurant too. I personally like The Fish Hopper the best plus you get a pretty good view!
2359,2012-04-23,5,"Long overdue review for what I like to call the ""MBA"". So anyway, here's a helpful hint: Monterey residents and their loved ones can get free admission. Save the $30 bones and see if you know somebody in Monterey, and ask them to hook it up with tickets. This gives you unlimited ins and outs and will give you a better chance to see everything. I believe that you also get free entrance on your birthday, but you may have to call and ask if such a promotion still exists.When I was there back in February, they had developed a seahorse display with all different sizes of seahorses on the first floor. Stunning, quirky little creatures. You'll find that the other parts of the aquarium, especially where they talk about conservation, seems to lay it on a little thick with the propaganda, but I guess that's a given for an entity whose goal is to sustain nature's bounty, in a city whose name is given to a maritime wildlife refuge.The weekends are clearly always crowded, especially holiday weekends. Avoid those if possible. But if you can't, try to make a point of seeing the otters and jellyfish first, since those exhibits tend to be the most populous. I loved the variety tank with the different prehistoric looking fish, sharks, and even some tortoises.Try to come full; the businesses on the way (most likely you're coming down Cannery Row) are highly marked up and busy."
2360,2015-10-20,4,Not sure if these animals are safer held captive or in the wild. However it was a fun educational visit!
2361,2009-03-19,5,"I love coming to the aquarium!  The last time I came was a few years back when they had the great white shark.  It was way too crowded for me, but it was cool to see a great white up close!  This past weekend was much better.  The aquarium still draws a large crowd, but its nice to be able to walk around and not have to push and shove people out of your way.I always feel like a big kid walking around the aquarium.  You get to ooh and aah at all the interesting exhibits and poke and prod at things in the touch pools.  You just have to shove the little kids out of the way or else they step all over your feet.  Too bad the sting rays were very antisocial.  I've never seen them come to the side for anyone to touch them.  This was a fun trip for me because I got to test out my new camera.  The jellyfish exhibit was awesome( static.px.yelp.com/bphot… ).  Its amazing how something so pretty can be so deadly.  My favorite exhibit was the sea otters( static.px.yelp.com/bphot… ).  They're just so cute and playful.  I got to watch the feeding and see them do some tricks.  Someone buy me an otter!There's supposed to be a new sea horse exhibit opening in April.  Maybe I'll have to do a day trip to go check it out.  =)"
2362,2008-07-29,5,"I was inspired by Steve L's recent Yelp review to use some vacation time and take the family to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. (Much to my horror, I realized it had been a whole three years since our last visit, and my young kids couldn't quite remember it. It was time to act.)Our trip confirmed what I had temporarily forgotten. Namely, that I absolutely love this place! And I was happy to find my older (and now more verbal) children feel exactly the same way, meaning we will likely be back again soon.Highlights: -- Entering the aquarium at opening time, practically the first people inside, and watching my kids' delight as they bounced from tank to tank, the whole building seemingly to ourselves-- At the touch tanks, watching my kids fear and doubt turn to curiosity, then to intense interest-- Just sitting for awhile and watching the breathtaking kelp forest tank -- Facing the sharks, tuna and sunfish in the blue glow of the gi-normous outer bay tank; -- Getting LOTS of good questions from the kids which my wife and I were actually able to accurately answer 90% of the time (yay us!)-- Two words: Jellies galleryI was also quite pleased with at how nice the aquarium cafeteria is.  The offered a large variety of high quality food and the service was friendly and amazing.  Prices were on the high side, but this is not unexpected in such a specialized location. And you may get to see seals or dolphins play in the bay right outside the window as you eat. Hard to beat that.Here are some tips and tricks that worked for our family and might be helpful to others:1. In the summer, go on a weekday if you can2. If you aren't a member, buy tickets beforehand and go directly to the ""have tickets"" line when you arrive.2. Getting there at opening time can provide a good stretch of crowd-free exploring3. Unless you bring all your food, do an early lunch (11:00) and then some afternoon snacks to avoid the bigger crowds at the cafeteria4. Go to the bat ray touch pool early; the rays keep to themselves after being touched 10,000 times or so in the morning; For those with kids, go to the various splash zones and touch tanks early too to avoid the crush of kids.One more note: There are jellyfish in two places: upstairs in the permanent jellies gallery, and downstairs in an exhibit called ""Jellies: Living Art"". The downstairs exhibit will be closing Sept 1."
2363,2015-12-20,5,A true 5 star establishment. This place is world class.I only wish the prices were lower but the free local passes are super great!
2364,2008-11-25,5,"Since I was little, this was always a fun place to go. Thank you for making your exhibits bilingual (English and Spanish) some of my students who are non native English speakers had a blast..this was the first field trip where they had access and independence to the exhibits.. and they want to go back! Thank you for keeping our chaperones in check. They run a tight security and have watchful eyes everywhere.... Tons of stuff in the gift shop that although overly priced are super cuddly and cute (stuffed turtles and penguins) I loved the exhibits.. Jelly Fish... Touch pool tanks.... Penguins.... Eels... Very parent friendly with the little play pens and stuff for smaller children (and caffeine and food within walking distance) TEACHERS: If you sign up super in advance you can do the discovery program where they take you into labs etc and do a quick over view and then the students are provided with a scavenger hunt type dealio.. and IT IS FREE!! *doorbell* more to be continued (sigh... day two of chaperoning begins) coffee check sweater checkwallet check walking boots checkbeing mentally prepared for 90 students checkgetting a good night sleep to endure two days of chaperoning-- priceless"
2365,2015-08-29,5,What a fun time to hang with the family and check out all the amazing sea life love this place!!!
2366,2015-07-19,4,I bought a family annual membership and we have gone several times despite living a couple of hours away. I never tire of seeing all of the marine animals. It is a wonderful aquarium that I recommend to anyone that visits Monterey.
2367,2012-04-11,5,"This place is as magic as it gets! The jellyfish section before the Deep Sea exhibit is my favorite. This place suits the whole family, but doesn't require an entire day. If you go to the aquarium at 10 am, you're done at 2 or maybe 3 pm. Also, make sure that you go to the bathroom BEFORE entering the exhibits, since the entrance and shops is the only location for that!"
2368,2010-02-17,3,"When I was in 6th grade, I came here on a field trip with my school to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and I thought it was quite possibly the most exciting and fun place I had ever been to. I remember getting a souvenir with my $5.00 allowance for the day and I think I probably still have that bubbly key chain somewhere around here ... but having had several return trips to the Aquarium made me realize that ... this place sort of blows.First, it's quite expensive to get in and some days you have to wait in this line outside just so they can do crowd control. It's definitely a 5 year old or under type place because it's really quite small and a lot smaller than I remembered and many of the exhibits and even the shows weren't as cool or intriguing as some of the ones they have at the zoo normally. For example, I found the penguin feeding at SF Zoo to be far more exciting and interactive than the one at the aquarium. Plus it's just plain crowded and you can't really see much and everyone's hands have already smeared the glass so it's sort of blurry even if you want to take a picture. It's not very astonishing and much of it you can find in your local fish store. I would skip this attraction for future reference ..."
2369,2012-08-30,5,"As a tourist attraction the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a well oiled machine that does not fail to wow each time I visit. Apart from the amazing exhibits and hands on activities for the kids, I thought the facilities and amenities were top notch. I can not tell you how many strollers rolled through the Aquarium the two days that we visited. Not once did I run into anyone or cause any stroller traffic accidents.  There was also plenty of stroller parking in all of the exhibit rooms.Things that I liked:1) Deep Ocean:The Tank that holds all the tuna, sharks and the one sun fish was AMAAAAAZing. I love this room. I am always in awe of the fish and how great they are. We were fortunate to see a feeding and saw the fish up close as they got their daily meal.2) Clean Diaper Changing Area: Both the ladies and mens rooms have areas that moms or dads can put baby to change an offending diaper. The changing table was clean and really well thought out. It was an actual table built into the wall with a plastic oval bowl like top. Baby fit right in the oval and there was a belt to secure baby if you needed to walk away to throw the diaper away or wash your hands. It was so clean. I am usually wary of using public changing stations but this one was so clean i wasn't to worried.3) Helpful Staff: Everyone was so nice and answered so many questions.4) The Animals: Can't forget the animals! The fish all looked happy and healthy. Baby really enjoyed the visit she couldn't stop babbling at the fish. We'll be taking her more often as she gets older."
2370,2015-02-14,5,"The aquarium is probably the best one I've been to ever. They always have new exhibits. We started off going to the Open Sea feeding, which is definitely impressive watching them feed all the marine life in that huge tank. The Jellies Experience is always one of my favorites. They have made some changes which is cool and they also added a new exhibit. Definitely a must go!"
2371,2009-06-05,4,"I need some sympathy right now... or some empathy (every set of nouns in that whole pathos/pathy category) Anyway, my little brother just brought me over to our fish tank to show me that our fish, an African Cichlid, died. =[ This review is dedicated in memory of you, Biff, my loyal little fish. Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great experience for those who are willing to slow down and simply enjoy the beauty of the natural world, captured perfectly by the aquarium. The habitats and displays are all rich with a variety of freshwater and tropical fish, along with some other awesome sea creatures. The huge jellyfish and shark tanks are beautiful and super captivating, even for someone like me who is usually quick to change the discovery channel for something more exciting. This place is great for families and kids, and apparently couples, although I don't see too much that's romantic about learning about aquatic life. Nothing about education ever really struck me as super sexy. Anyway, I recommend coming to Monterey for this place. It's a beautiful place that's properly maintained where you will learn a lot and find a deeper appreciation for nature.Again, Biff, please rest in peace. May you be free to swim in the endless oceans of fish heaven."
2372,2014-08-28,5,"Simply awesome. So much to do, so little time.  You can easily spend the day attentively reviewing the exhibits.  Other reviews will give you better details on the place, so I'll keep it short and simple- I visit Monterey happily once a year or so from SF- and the main event is the aquarium.  It is worth every mile on the road and dollar at the hotel!  If you like aquariums, this will surely be at the top of your list.  Don't hesitate- make it happen!"
2373,2015-07-11,3,"Clam chowder - applewood bacon flavor overpowers hint of clams.  Take a lesson from Sam's Chowder of Half Moon Bay, Hog Island Oyster Bar, Swan Oyster Bar for really good clam chowder.  The view is spectacular however"
2374,2013-03-30,5,"Little price-y but a good cause, great information and displays, but crushing crowds.I guess if it was any cheaper the crowds would be worst.Great plastic display.Yeah for shorebirds.Jellyfish are amazing."
2375,2015-01-01,5,I love all the fish here ! They are awesome and I want them as pets!
2376,2015-10-07,5,"For locals that frequently have guests from out of town, the ""Ocean Advocate"" membership is a great deal.  Follow up a stop by a nearby wine tasting with a stroll through the jellyfish exhibit and a visit to watch the penguin feeding. Just don't be surprised if you have a strange craving for seafood after this!  (Sustainable of course)"
2377,2010-01-06,5,"Never ending smiles from my son after taking him here. It is a day event of awe and wonder. LM cannot stop talking about this place and how if mommy has time to take him again. :)If you want to day to relax and explore life under the sea, this is the place to go. It is a place for all ages and if you are hungry and would rather eat somewhere else, just get your hand stamped and come back later.Most definately will be back again."
2378,2015-10-06,5,We love the Aquarium so much we keep a yearly membership for the whole family and guests. The facilities can be a bit crowded on the weekends during the summer so we usually go at different times. The Aquarium is both beautiful and an incredible learning environment. On one visit the giant octopus was out of hiding and I got some amazing shots. (No flash!) The big tanks are incredible and the hands on pools are a lot of fun too. You can spend hours there exploring the Monterey Bay and still discover something new on subsequent visits.
2379,2012-02-12,3,"It's one of the better aquariums on the west coast, but not as good as some other aquariums in the U.S. such as the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. A few things that would get this place up to five stars:Reduce the number of people in the aquarium at once. It constantly felt overcrowded inside the exhibits, to the point where I saw others getting pushed out of the way by impatient or rude people. The girl at the ticket window said they handle about 7,000 people on a week day, 12,000 people on a weekend. For a smallish aquarium, that's a lot.Ban cameras altogether. This is kind of a personal pet peeve, but I hate it when I see people racing through a museum trying to get a picture of every exhibit and not taking time to experience them. If you want to see a photo of a jellyfish later, just google it. Believe me, there aren't any new species of fish here that have somehow eluded photographic capture until you came along and took a blurry photo with your cell phone.Better display collateral. There were a lot of interesting animals to look at, but never any information beyond a simple placard that listed the scientific name and where they live in the wild. A couple of times I found myself looking things up on wikipedia from my phone to find out more information. Yes, this is probably a bit hypocritical since I just railed on people and their cameras, but I was trying to learn more about stuff. And beat a Tiny Wings level. But mostly learn about stuff.Kids-free time. Perhaps my most controversial, and also most lucrative idea. Nothing ruins a museum more than children. I'd pay an extra $20 to be able to go through here without any kids. Maybe open it up one night a month, serve some drinks, rake in the dough. It works well for the California Academy of Sciences and the Exploratorium, and I wish every museum offered it.None of these things are real major issues, but would be enough to make the aquarium go from a ""check it out once every couple of years if I'm in the neighborhood"" place to a must-visit attraction."
2380,2014-05-19,1,"I suppose if you come from a place with no zoo/aquarium then it might be okay but the pricing is insanity.  The exhibits were nice but honestly, I saw half the animals I paid $80 to see for FREE less than a mile away on the Naval Point Pier.  Just follow the barking sounds and you'll see seals, jellyfish and otters.  The place was CRAWLING with field trips and I was told by locals that's pretty common.  No thanks."
2381,2015-08-16,4,"It was very cool, extremely kid friendly, I was really hoping to see more animals, bigger sized fish and animals. Staff was very friendly."
2382,2017-01-17,5,For a visitor this place is in not only the best location but also easiest to get to from all the other buildings on cannery row. What a fun time and its always changing. The staff was even nice enough to show us some behind the scene stuff its amazing what people do for each other just out of a converaation. I learned so much and will use it for the better all because of this place.
2383,2007-10-20,5,"I never get tired of the Outer Bay exhibit.  I love the darkness of the exhibit and the beautiful, other worldly quality of jellyfish (they claim it's the largest permanent collection of jellyfish in the US).  You'll find jellies, big and small, some completely transparent, others with vibrant purple spots.  And at the center, the million gallon tank is the home of my favorite fish, the mola, ocean sunfish.  The huge head and small side fins seem so out of proportion.  He's a gentle, slow-moving, shy giant.  Normally molas don't like being in the same tank with each other, but they've managed to find two that peacefully co-exist.  Right now they have a juvenile great white shark, for only the third time.  Not many aquariums attempt to keep a great white in captivity.  It's a treat to see him (he was my favorite fish as a child) close up.   The kelp forest also has dark areas to lurk and gaze at fish.  You can get splashed at the touch pool by a ray.  Watch a feeding, catch a film or two in the auditorium.  Be sure to step outside to enjoy the bay breeze.  The views are stunning.  You'll find harbor seals nearby on the beach, not moving around much but also enjoying the lovely bay.The exhibits are not only informative but socially responsible.  There's one about ordering the right seafood (sustainable).  This place makes you care about the ocean and the creatures in it.  You may be able to find free parking on that road that is right next to the bay and leads to Carmel.  There's a biking/running trail there and it makes for a pleasant walk (watch out for the people on bikes though).  It's $24.95 for an adult ticket.  Cafe Portola isn't bad at all and there are multiple gift shops.   The largest one is by the entrance. They have mola jewelry."
2384,2014-07-09,1,"Don't know if I ever disagreed with yelp users this much. First, the parking in just ridiculous. We got to the aquarium at 9:15 am and didn't get in until 10:00 am. That's because there is no aquarium parking AND there are no signs or people to guide you to a place to park. Next, we try to see the Sea Otter feeding. About 25 people can see this and the remainder have their view blocked. An aquarium employee said, don't worry, you can see it on the TV screen. True, or I could watch any video on youtube of see otters feeding. Then, we tried to go to the White Shark presentation. But the video was not working. The next presentation was canceled too. Finally, we waiting for the big show outside only to be disappointed again. People hopping around singing with fish cutouts on sticks. What a waste of money, gas, and time."
2385,2012-07-24,4,"Come here and all your friends will be JELLY!Having interned at an aquarium back in my younger days, I have a special love for aquariums. I must say this aquarium trumps the Birch Aquarium in La Jolla. This aquarium is expensive, but it is also a lot bigger than other aquariums so the price makes sense. The exhibits were well thought out, beautiful and informative. Set aside 2 hours for this place (maybe up to 3 hours if you can handle crowds!) I wish we had come right when it opened because the exhibits get crowded!! You pretty much have to wait your turn, go up to the glass, point your camera, shoot, and then get out of the way. Def. come here early!!!My favorite exhibits were...*Jellyfish! They are AMAZING. The exhibit is huge compared to others I've seen and the bright blue background really contrasts and makes the jellyfish stand out. I could seriously stare at them for hours!*Tufted puffin bird: Some of the birds look like they have blonde stylish eyebrows. So interesting!!*Sea otters: They are so cute! I love that theres 2 levels to view them.*Open Sea: Hammerhead shark, leopard sharks and a huge ass turtle :) I love watching all the sardines clear the path when they swim by.*Sardines: I love how they swim in circles*Giant octopus: This octopus is hugeeeeee. what a sight!& penguins, wave simulator, petting the stingrays.Throughout the aquarium you can walk outside and get some fresh air (& escape the crowds) and look out into Monterey bay. So lovely!You can also find Nemo & Dory here :)"
2386,2007-12-30,5,"Brand new rewrite, after visiting 4 to 5 times in the past 7 years.No visit to Monterey Peninsula is ever complete without making a stop at this brilliant non profit organization that really dedicates itself to public awareness, education and reinvesting back into the community (of people as well as marine life).I love places that continue to reinvent themselves, whether it be (seafood) restaurants or in this case, an establishment of sealife exhibits. Every year that I come back, there's ALWAYS something new. Perhaps it is to make room for a seasonal display or exhibit (last year sometime it was African penguins) and this year, the strangest looking shark I have ever seen. The aquarium even proudly claims they are the only place to ever exhibit this rare sea creature. My Nikon D70 skillz are extremely amateurish and it was so difficult to capture a snapshot for your enjoyment. But it looked like this oneyelp.com/biz_photos/2DX5…I think MBA staff have been reading Yelp reviews especially the jokesters amongst us who marvel at god's wonderous sea creatures while at the same time drool incessantly as they swim by, wondering what they would taste like with some soy sauce and wasabi. To combat the sushi gourmet (and typical seafood lover)'s temptations, they set up a new touch screen interactive exhibit that looks like a seafood bar. Here's what it looks like yelp.com/biz_photos/2DX5…It's meant for adults and kids. Each selection educates what is ""earth friendly"" seafood and to stay the hell away from nasty ass farmed fish like salmon. They try to remain PC about not mentioning fish farms in China, where fish there are often fed a steady diet of human sewage and antibiotics, then exported the hell out of their country. You rarely see reports like this in the mainstream media, because everyone wants to know if Oprah thinks Obama is as dreamy in the bedroom as he is on camera.So yes there are beautiful bluefin tuna in the MBA million gallon tanks,(kuro maguro for you J-food philes) and is not considered good for the earth for you to consume. But I have to admit, once in a while man does need a juicy phat ass piece of TORO to feel better where crispy fine swine will not suffice.This year there are TWO sea otter exhibits. The usual space and in another area, a bigger space where you can see them swim, frolick with each other, and get some closer up shots should your digital cam skillz require some practice.As usual the jellyfish exhibits are always a delight. For those who like to study the motion of the ocean, the non stop swimiming of schools of silvery fish like mackeral and sardines (IWASHI!!!)  are easily seen in at least 3 locations, and strangely enough at the entrance of a few of the exhibits. Ironically this is not that far off from a classical Edomae/Tokyo style nigiri omakase paced meal, where the silvery fish (hikarimono) can sometimes be served near the beginning (what a TEASE).It seems that most ""white fish"" (shiromi) if from a reliable source, would overall be deemed earth friendly. Hooray for shiromi purisits. Boo hoo for akami purists (red meat lovers like tuna). I did note some interesting species of the snapper family (""tai"") swimming about in the million gallon tank. Missing are torafugu (blowfish) and octopi, squid, or clams for reasons we don't need to get into right now, but it sounds like a trip to the sushizzle bar is in order for me very soon....5 stars for what the aquarium offers from exhibits to a little something for the little ones. No comment or review about the cafeteria style food, as it was nothing to write home about last time. And by the way, should you be so lured and lusted after, and hungry for SUSHI and SASHIMI after seeing all of god's creatures swimming around like Fly girl strippers in 10"" heel boots spinning around a metal pole to tempt the Man, avoid going to Hanagasa in Carmel for Sushi, drive much much much further away (north or south), so you leave some good memories behind.Triple A, aka California State Automobile Association, offers admission tickets at $2 below retail price for members. Check your nearby hotel or B&B if you stay there whether they offer overnight stay and admission package at a reduced cost (e.g. Centrella Inn in Pacific Grove)."
2387,2015-12-04,5,"Amazing day, exhausted and happy. Soo much to see, up close, no dive gear needed. This aquarium pumps the bay water into the tanks so the the aquatic life are in their natural environment, and the water is filtered before it goes out so nothing is added to the environment that should not be there. There are staff standing everywhere to help answer questions and to give little facts that we never thought to ask. Family friendly, adults will not be bored, and children can really have a hands on experience at the touch tanks."
2388,2015-08-12,5,"Great fun, with lots of stuff to see. The jellyfish exhibits and open sea tank were my favorite."
2389,2014-05-28,4,"I've been to a few other aquariums and this one is one of the best! I've always been in awe every time I've been here. The people who work here seem to enjoy what they do and are really helpful. I recommend trying to get here early on the weekends, since it can get fairly crowded, or get a membership if you can afford it and you plan on coming here more often than not. The Aquarium opens 1 hour early for members."
2390,2015-08-11,4,Great for kids.  My six year old enjoyed it so much he wanted to stay longer.  It's a great experience for kids.
2391,2009-06-28,5,"What a great place to go to - don't miss this if you are in Monterey. Set aside a good block of time for the aquarium; one can easily spend hours looking around here. The Secret Life of Seahorses exhibit is going on now and they have so much to see in addition to that. Jellyfish, sea otters, sharks, penguins, many different types of fish and so much more.The Aquarium has a little theater where I saw a film on jellyfish and they show other films throughout the day. A volunteer had handed us a map of the aquarium which included a schedule of feedings and films. This is pretty useful, I would suggest asking a ticket sales clerk for one or getting one from a volunteer.I enjoyed the visit thoroughly and thought it was worthwhile."
2392,2015-11-26,5,"It's been over 20 years since we've been to this aquarium, and though I was irritated with the increase in price, which is bound to happen in a couple decades, the upgrades were well worth the price of admission.  Very interactive stations for people to get more information on specific animals, more than a couple kids areas which was great considering we had a 4 year old.  We didn't get through the whole place in a day, however if you're planning a one day trip, come the day prior an hour before closing and you can spend the last hour touring the musueum and come the next day through the members only area without having to wait in line to buy a ticket.  That was awesome."
2393,2015-08-05,5,We always love coming to the aquarium - it's such an amazing place to visit for kids or grown ups. The exhibits also change occasionally - it's very fun to see new things. All my friends who visit us here in ca like to visit Monterey aquarium- it's one of the places we are proud to show. Always recommend it!
2394,2015-09-23,5,"Amazing place, so easy to come spend hours running around this place.  Great for the whole family. Cannery Row is filled with great shops and activities."
2395,2012-02-26,5,"""I would rather be able to appreciate things I cannot have than to have things I am not able to appreciate.""  ~Elbert Hubbard Ever since I was a little girl, I loved aquariums.  Maybe because I'm a Pisces and a lover of all things water-based:  beaches, swimming, drinking (HA!).  But, there's something about visiting an aquarium that brings you back to your inner child.   You know, when life was easy and simple, when seeing a seahorse (which, by the way, I saw for the first time in my entire life) literally makes you squeal with joy.   And say, ""LOOOOOKKKK, they DO exist!"" Sometimes, life gets crazy and hectic and you forget to stop and appreciate the little things in life.  The stuff that creates warmth and renews your sense of spirit and self.  I took myself to the aquarium, a date if you will, where the entire day was spent just on me.  I loved the drive down to Monterey, it's far enough so you feel like you're escaping reality, but close enough that you're reminded you're safe.  The wind in my hair, Kelly Clarkson blasting on the radio, and me singing my lungs off.  What I loved most about this day, was that I slowed down.  I took in everything I was seeing.  Usually, I'm a ""go-go-go"" gal, places to be, people to see, but I stopped and watched the most incredible fishes...eat, swim and just be.  There was this one crazy looking fish that had these tiny whiskers and I stared at its micro-fibers and was amazed.  I thought, ""Man, I would have never seen that if I rushed.""  I loved that day.  It was the best date, ever!"
2396,2015-04-17,5,Yep.  Love this place and the kids love it too.  We like to get there early and spend the whole day.  Will keep coming back.
2397,2015-08-02,4,"The ticket prices seem a little bit too overpriced to me but it is still an enjoyable experience. It will take about 2 hours to go through all the areas so if you want to kill some time, this is a good place to go. If you have kids, they will love this place--especially the touch zone. Great atmosphere, clean building, friendly staff, and reasonably priced gift shops...what more can you ask for?"
2398,2015-08-02,5,"Love love love this aquarium! Best I've been too. Expensive but worth it in comparison to other places. Only downside is the massive crowds of people in there but what can you expect, right? Great exhibits lots to see. Fun and exciting."
2399,2014-11-08,5,"It is super important to bring your cell phone to take millions of pictures. When you take a picture, make sure you block the view as much as possible. Bring all your screaming kids."
2400,2007-07-30,4,"I like the giant aquariums and the interactive kiddie room where you can push buttons and these loud elephant seal and whale sounds come out.The 2-year-old dug it, pointing at everything and squealing BISH! BISH!If you get your tickets at your local AAA office you can save $2.The otters display is kind of eh. I mean, okay, they're cute otters but the only reason fools line up five deep to see them is because they've seen an ad someplace.My favorite thing is the huge otherworldly sunfish (two of them!)."
2401,2009-12-21,5,"This is the best aquarium I've ever been to hands down, the others can't compare. There was a lot to see and there were a lot of different species of sea life that I've never seen before! The drive was long from San Francisco, but it was so worth it. The tanks are super huge and really beautiful, there's a calming effect that comes from sitting there and looking at the different fishes. They had a really cool exhibit, that had a sunfish (it is huge). I think that was the best part of my visit there. It does get a bit crowded and parking is hard to find. Definitely a good experience."
2402,2012-03-28,5,"I love, love, love, love, love, love, LOVE this place so damned much. No complaints, except that they should have a National Broke Person's Discount day. Those otters! That kelp forest room! The sea dragon thingies! Worth the drive, worth the tourism headache of the surrounding area, totally worth it all. As an added bonus, a major portion of the fees goes toward ocean conservation and research. Heck. Yes. Note: While otter feeding time is pretty adorable, the crush of sticky screaming children and grumpy tourists with giant noisy cameras in your face can be a bit much for the average otter-watcher. Go to the otter tank right as feeding time ends- especially in the early part of the week- and within minutes you'll have the otters almost to yourself."
2403,2009-03-05,3,"I've been to many aquaria - Shedd, Tampa, Mandalay Bay, Newport, Academy of Sciences, at least 20 Zoos - Monterey Bay is nice, but the price is not and the exhibits are not novel.  The location on the god-awful Cannery Row doesn't help.Part of the place is closed for rennovations - ideally they'll make it better - though I'm not really sure more seahorses will do that.The setting is glorious and the outer bay tank is mesmerizing while the jelly fish exhibit is the best I've seen - if you can see it past the 2,235 children running around and screaming - and that isn't just isolated to the 50% of the building that is essentially ""kids only"" and full of toys, games, and early childhood education modules.See it once, love the setting - it'd take a lot to bring me back - unless I had a couple rugrats I could let loose to scream and play.....but then again I might be considerate and take them to the ball-pit at Chuck E Cheese's instead and actually use my time at the Aquarium to educate them."
2404,2007-08-30,4,"After walking around the aquarium for about an hour, the following conversation developed as we were standing in front of the outer bay exhibit:Him: Dang, adults are worse than kids.Me: Whatcha mean?An old man rushes by us, hapless children falling in his wake, as his camera raises and a flash goes off.Him: Oh you know, the shoving, the rudeness. When a five year old steps on my feet it's one thing, but when adults are causing bodily harm, it's freaking assault!Me *laughs*Me: You're so foolish, it's not that- *gets whacked by someones purse*. Me: Oh this ish is going down, that was uncalled for! He manages to hold me back and we turn to look at the tank once again. All of a sudden a giant marshmellow monstrosity appears, with puffy skin, scalloped fins, human-like eyes. Our jaws drop, we lean forward in anticipation, and as it swims closer to the edge of the tank, thuds and ""ow!""s sound behind us as we move to greet it. In the wonder and the excitement of the ocean sunfish, we too caused casualties of war. Damn shame.This aquarium is great because it's so big, has so many crazy creatures, and just recently got a great white in. However, with all of the tourists flocking to see everything (on a Monday mid morning, no less!), it's a pain in the ass to try to get close enough to see things, especially to the smaller exhibits. Children and adults alike will get on your nerves, so be prepared to be patient and spend plenty of time there. The jelly fish exhibit is freaking awesome, and the ocean sunfish? Seriously, you've never seen anything like it."
2405,2013-04-11,5,"Monterey is a fabulous little town, everything is so unusual and reminiscent of the past, when you walk  him feel that you have gone into the past, the aquarium is a real attraction and entertainment,very educational and fun highly recommended"
2406,2015-11-18,5,Being a local I find it interesting to return everytime there is a new exhibit.  Each time I go I discover something new and literally spend most of the day there...In one word - AMAZING!
2407,2015-11-17,5,"It was awesome,  the feedings are great, go to the kelp forest feeding and the albatross was cool. Love the open ocean tank and the jelly fish are pretty dang sweet. Almost felt like I was diving sometimes. Will come back sometime.. there are a lot of kids there though so be prepared for a multitude of lil groms running around."
2408,2015-06-17,5,"What a fantastic way to spend the day as a family! There was something for everyone - kids play area, touch pools, feeding shows and fantastic exhibits. My personal favorite part, however, was the sit down restaurant that included a quiet(er) dining room, beautiful bay view and fantastic menu. Service was wonderful and wine was served! Couldn't have asked for a better day! Tip: Be sure to make a reservation as soon as you arrive for Cindy's Waterfront so you can be sure to get a table."
2409,2016-12-07,5,The best aquarium in the world! Have been to so many other aquariums and nothing compares to this! We don't have children but there are SO many interactive elements and lots of things to keep busy.  Don't forget to visit AAA first for discounted tickets!
2410,2006-10-27,5,"Without doubt this place is the inspiration for my youngest's desire to be involved in marine biology.  We have been members since it was built, yeah I'm old!   We have been dragging the kids there since they were born.  As members you can participate in member nights and even camp out inside the place on special member nights.  The coolest place to sleep is in the Outer Bay exhibit but you have to be fast, you'd be amazed how fast the Birkenstock crowd can run when the doors open for the overnighters!  I'm slowed by a bad knee so I guess the only time I'll ever sleep with the fishes is when it's for real.Another benefit of membership is all the extra tickets they give you.  We like to give our extras to someone in the long line, someone near the back with little kids.  It's nice we don't have to stand in that line.  As members we use the side entrance.  Worth the $100. for the family plan!mbayaq.org/efc/outerbay.…"
2411,2008-07-15,5,"If you like Finding Nemo YOU WILL LOVE THIS!!!!This is one of the best aquariums out there. Half of this place is full of huge aquariums that bring the under sea world to life right in front of you eyes. Vivid colors of coral and fish and plants and animals everywhere. Every corner has something new and exciting to look at, making it every kid's imaginary playground and even for adults too. One room is basically  a HUGE MASSIVE aquarium that has these huge fish that most people I would bet have never seen before. They almost look like aliens swimming in the water right--they are so big and seem so close to you through those thick panes of glass that they seem to be looking right at you. Just when you think you are the ones watching them, do you ever think that all of these creatures are actually looking at you?? Maybe they view us an aquarium as much as we do for them?? These are the kinds of things you think about when you see creatures of the deep that you don't normally think even exist in the world, and then you come to the jellyfish exhibit which takes you even further into the depths of your minds. These jellyfish look like art just floating there. They live effortlessly it seems and their tentacles and body parts light up on the dark backgrounds of the water and it is simply just magical. My boyfriend and I were just speechless here. And that is what a good aquarium should do--make you speechless at times, make you inquisitive at times, and put you in a state of awe and wonder. There is so much to our world that we take for granted. Go here and learn about only a small part of it."
2412,2013-03-05,5,"This is a must see for any family visiting Northern California or the northern part of California's Central Coast.  It rivals the Georgia Aquarium and blows The Aquarium of the Pacific out of the water (figuratively speaking of course).There are so many things to see here but the highlights for our family were the: 1) jellyfish; 2) seahorses; 3) touch tanks; 4) penguins; and 5) the ability to go to the outdoor decks to check out the sea lions in the bay.TIP: While the penguin feeding is cool, people cram into the area very early.  You get better views of the penguins (and can actually move around) if you try to view them shortly after the feeding is over."
2413,2015-11-14,5,"This was our second visit to the aquarium. It was (as always) a beautiful and educational experience.  It has changed quite a bit from our last visit 5 years ago, but the clear focus on the wildlife is still there. My wife and I will definitely be back again."
2414,2015-11-14,5,"Bring the kids here monthly, but not just for them, love it as well. Bought family membership we go so often. Fun for the whole family is actually true with the Aquarians."
2415,2015-02-06,5,Sadly no place to find discount ticket prices unless a student but something you must see. A few things to actually do as far as interaction with the creatures and a corner for younger children like up to the age of 10.
2416,2015-11-07,5,"One of the best aquariums I have ever been to! Far better than Baltimore or New York or the large aquarium in North Carolina - very enjoyable, great displays, wonderful layout and super programs!"
2417,2015-06-08,4,"An amazing aquarium that I grew up visiting. Some exhibits have been made to attract kids and can therefore seem very childish, but still a great place."
2418,2017-01-02,2,"We were really looking forward to this visit.   Drove 2 hours from our San Francisco vacation and were somewhat disappointed.    First the cost was far to high for the size and scope of the exhibits.    $50 admission is simply far too much, especially when you consider it only took about 3 hours to tour the entire facility.    Add to this the parking at $15 and the over priced and flavorless food in their cafeteria and we would not recommend this visit.    Its nice but if you've been to other aquariums, there is nothing unique about it other then the cost being so high."
2419,2015-07-16,5,"Personally, I think this is the best aquarium in the world. I am a member and everytime we are in Monterey, we go there. I love how they promote ocean conservation. Great place!!!"
2420,2015-09-02,5,"We had a fantastic time. Very interactive and informative. We did the Jelly Tour and thought it was well worth the extra dollars. Many different species and environments, great time for sure."
2421,2009-07-23,5,"Yes it's a pain in the butt to navigate when the hordes are there, but try picking a less crowded time as it's a treasure!! Also, don't be shy about letting any kids you brought with you shoulder their way in a bit... (some of the adults are really overbearing with their attempt to document the sea life... come on, it's not like you brought professional equipment--get quick shot if you must and scoot OVER!! ) I really enjoyed the new Secret LIfe of Sea Horses exhibit and the penguins!   And y'all, one thing will be forever emblazoned in my mind:          I saw a video of a sea horse giving birth and it was spectacular!! Figures that when the male of a species gives birth, he SHOOTS IT out of his belly like the beginning of an amazing baseball pitch!  I say beginning because then the new baby wriggles off and does his/her own thing, blazing his/her own new trajectory.  Tips:Call up the local Monterey Hostel, inquire about buying special VIP entrance 2 day passes (they were the same price if not cheaper than at the door but admitted you for 2 consecutive days!).  Student and senior discounts, too!Drop by the hostel to pick up your tickets, and enjoy free parking there, just a few block walk directly down to the aquarium!If you want a shorter visit, you can pay 25 cents per 10 minutes at the meters that are slightly closer.It's nice to know you have a day to come back for when you get tired of the masses or just ran out of time! :)"
2422,2016-11-05,2,"Love what they are doing for the environment. Hate that the field trips there don't control their kids and allow them to run wild. Ruins the experience for everyone else. Some punk grade school kids thought it was funny to disrupt the infant/toddler area. Again, no chaperone in sight. No employee managing behavior either. So annoying!"
2423,2010-04-07,4,"Nothing more really needs to be said about Monterey Bay Aquarium except that it's a great time. They have sharks, and I love sharks, so of course I'm going to give the place a good review. It's been reviewed to death, so you already know what you are expecting before you go. With children or not, this aquarium is a blast for all ages and shouldn't be missed when you are in the area!"
2424,2013-02-19,5,"I always love coming here.  Even on the busiest holidays with the loudest kids running around I still have a special place in my heart for the Monterey Bay Aquarium.I came here recently to see the new exhibits (jellyfish and seahorses).  The displays managed to be entertaining and informative.  Like the psychedelic themed jelly fish exhibit.  There was 'groovy' music and a totally trippy mirror room with jelly fish.  My favorite mainstay exhibit is the gigantic deep sea tank.  I was very lucky to come in on a day where I could see two (!) turtles and the goofy looking sunfish.  The only gripe I have about this place is the food.  I don't think you came all the way here for museum food, though."
2425,2008-12-18,5,"I LOOOOVED this aquarium as a kid and after years of not visiting, it still bring out the inner child in me. Well and glutton. And since this is Yelp and the haven for gluttons alike, I have to admit... walking through the exhibits did make me hungry. I did crave a nice slab of seared ahi after viewing the feeding in the Deep Sea tank... not to mention all the jelly fish reminded me of a Chinese banquet. I forgot ""urchin"" and gleefully yelled out ""UNI!"" when we were in the petting tanks. Watching the salmon swim made crave seared sockeye sashimi that I got up in Seattle. All in all, it was absolutely gorgeous. The aquarium is very well laid out. The exhibits are beautifully done and plan ahead so you can watch all the feedings. The place was slightly over crowded with families and kids. Since I love the sea otters (no they did not remind me of any food... or cause hunger cravings...) I insisted on waiting at the tank half an hour before the feeding. Just as they started feeding there were some nasty parents who wanted to push their way to the front. Can I say... UH excuse ME!? No way. If you want a good view, then you wait here half an hour beforehand!!!It took us the majority of a Sunday to go through the place and look at all the exhibits. Got some super cute pictures too! Lastly, a huge thank you to my friend Vince who hooked us up with his guest passes... Ticket prices here have gone up over the years... It now costs nearly 45 dollars for two adults to get in!"
2426,2012-05-30,3,"This is the only aquarium I've been to, or at least the only one I remember. It's a treasure trove of wonders, but a little bit small. You can easily see and read every placard in about four hours. Five, if you want to get every possible picture of the otters, because they are SO CUTE.Oh, there are other otherworldly animals here: sharks, fish (including some BIG ones), a cute turtle, penguins, puffins, rays, starfish, squishy sea cucumbers, jellyfish - the list goes on. If you want to do some sightseeing, the balconies outside has telescopes for your snooping needs.I love this place because it has plenty of marine life to keep your curiosity satisfied, and the giant octopus is always a showstopper. That said, I have a few gripes:- Kids. Okay, so we can't ban them all together. I know these natural reserves need all the funds they can get to upkeep research and maintenance, and to protect the sea creatures, but my God... the kids... and their parents. This place brings out the kid in everyone, including me, my partner, and every single young adult who don't know how to control their kids.- Please reinforce the no-flash policy. I put up my camera, set my focus... and then some old fart takes a picture with full-on flash. And the poor octopus recoils from horror (yes, I saw someone do this despite the ""no flash"" sign above the tank!). And I'm blinded.- Parking. Not much you can do here. Good luck finding a spot. Doesn't help that the aquarium is surrounded by one-way streets. Right-turn loops, anyone?Will I come back? Yeah, but probably during the fall when the kids are back in school."
2427,2012-04-27,5,"Pricey admission, but worth it.Very clean. Very good exhibits. Informative!The 'feedings' are so fun to watch.The scale of the 'Open Sea' is unbelievable. The aquarium is very good & worth it!"
2428,2013-08-27,5,"This place is awesome and I'm glad to live 45mins away.  Best time to visit is during the weekdays. There is so much learn from this place.  If you're an avid photographer, this is one cool place to get some unique shots.I balked at the $35 tickets but after spending 3 hours here it was well worth it."
2429,2012-11-01,5,"Went here today. It is soooooo beautful and such a great experience. We saw the Jelly Fish exhibit which was fun with a 60's psychedelic theme to it. Also saw the regular jellies downstairs and they were gorgeous. The background music they play in the jelly area is just perfect for making you feel you're in another world. other cool exhibits: The Secret Lives of Seahorses, the Open Sea (tank with all kinds of fish and stingrays and more), The Touch Pool, Puffer Penguins Exhibit and much more.It is a bit expensive at $32.50 a ticket, but its worth it if you spend time enjoying the unique experience. I like that the exhibits were pretty simple so you could really focus on experiencing the sea life. Also, there are special exhibits geared towards kids. All the titles are bilingual Spanish."
2430,2012-05-07,5,"Came here for the new Jellyfish Experience. I love this place. I want to get married here haha joking. But seriously, skip the ticket lines and just buy your tickets online before you come. If you forget to buy them online just buy them with your phone. We waited outside in the cold for over 20 minutes before we were able to get INSIDE to wait in line some more. Friendly staff and great exhibits."
2431,2012-08-19,3,"Maybe I'm just not an aquarium person? Made this my first stop on a long weekend road trip and was overwhelmed by the crowds (Saturday really is as busy as everyone says it is) and the noise (ended up walking around with my headphones in). The exhibits were good but there wasn't a ton of information available, at least that I could find. Perhaps I needed to do an audio tour or a walking tour? My other aquarium reference points, Shedd Aquarium and Waikiki Aquarium (don't laugh, it's world-class) offered much more information at each exhibit.If I were in Monterey for another reason I would probably stop again, but I definitely would not consider this a destination attraction."
2432,2015-07-06,4,"This review is for their after hours event. We went back on a Saturday night for the live music, food tasting and drinks. The entire aquarium was open as well, plus side was there was no one there! No kids screaming, or crazy tourists pushing! Such a great idea! No extra charge, just the cost of admittance to the aquarium. There were five food stations open, along with a bar. A $5 ticket bought you one sampling from any table. We were able to sample all the tables, the crab cakes were awesome, along with the spare rib, and chorizo corn on the cob. The bartender definitely made the $9 drinks worth it as well. I'd go back if I lived closer."
2433,2009-05-15,5,"Awesome Educational Experience! Thank You!  for giving us this opportunity to view the ocean's wild life up close and personal. To expand your horizons, understanding the coexistence of another world is enlightening and most enjoyable. Treat yourself! Locals FREE admission week is such a nice gesture. See you there =)..."
2434,2012-06-18,5,"It took me awhile to write a review about this place and I wonder why! Besides the perk of being in beautiful Monterey, this aquarium is so much fun and there is a lot to see. I could spend hours here. The jellyfish tank is beautiful and its so serene staring at their tanks. Oh the wonderful whimsical seahorses, their installation is a must see. There are too many great things I could write about this place so all I can say is ""just go!"""
2435,2015-08-20,5,This place is so interesting and cool. My family and I were so interested in this place. This place is so big. I touched so many animals I never even heard of. The sharks and everything we huge. The place is AMAZING AND INTERESTING.
2436,2008-03-23,5,"THIS IS THE COOLEST AQUARIUM I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! Granted, I have not been to many, but I cannot imagine any other even compare to Monterey's.I remember when the aquarium first opened in the mid 80's, I was blown away! I would go several times a year with my school to see and learn about ocean life. It was really wonderful! Since then, I have been probably another thousand times, and each time I go is like the first; I am blown away! The place keeps getting better and better and better! The jellyfish exhibit is so amazing, seeing these creatures so up close is (with lack of a better word) magical. Also there are hammer head sharks (my next favorite), a crazy awesome sardine tank; which needs to be seen to believe, penguins, bat-ray petting area (ya, you can pet a bat-ray here!), and SOO much more.The coolest thing about the aquarium is every year they host the opening night of the Monterey Wine Festival where most of the local wineries and ""upscale"" restaurants are serving their finest wines/food at small booths throughout the aquarium. I have gone to this about 4 times, and in my opinion, it is one of those events to  DO BEFORE YOU DIE, comparable to seeing the Superbowl.If you are going to the MBAq, plan it out right; don't go on a weekend (and if you do, stay away from the penguin exhibit and the petting pools because there will be a million kids forcing their way in front of you), get there early, and DO NOT eat there. There are so many restaurants in and near the area which are better and less expensive.Best Plan:  1. Breakfast/brunch-- Trail Side Cafe  2. Playtime-- run all over the aquarium see everything  3. Get your Buzz on-- get a glass of wine and some cheese at the                                                                  Taste of Monterey  4. Dinner-- Go to Carmel Valley (not Carmel, go inland) eat at Cafe                       Rustica  5. Party-- Running Iron, my old watering hole! Mingle with the local-                    yocals  6. Sleep-- go east on Carmel Valley Rd., find a turn-out, sleep                      anywhere on the road!A PERFECT DAY!"
2437,2010-05-03,4,"Location: This place is very easy to find it's on the GPS, tour maps, tour books, if you still can't find it ask someone, anyone. Right on the famous Cannery Row, parking my be a problem. East a ways is a public garage, which I would suggest using. Street parking is limited and I would stay a way because it may not be enough time. We spent 5.5 hr here.Atmosphere/Ambiance: Fish, fish, and more fish. This is a very modern, beautiful, and educational, aquarium. From the background music to the tank displays the setting is very entertaining and easy to lose track of time. Very family, kid, and handicap friendly, something for everyone. Service: Staff very friendly and inviting. They have interactive tanks where you can touch the rays, starfish, and kelp. They have a drink, self-serve, and sit-down café. Several gift shops throughout. Quality: The best I've seen so far, a must see!Cost: At first felt it was a bit much. For two of us we spent close to $60.00. But after seeing it from the inside, it's worth it. For a family of four you'll want to save up for this one. You can save some money by eating a heavy meal before entering, park where it's free and walk to aquarium. That's what we did, kept the car at the motel and only had a 1/3 mile walk. Would I come back? Only to bring family/friends from out of town who haven't seen it before.Summary: 4 stars. A place to impress that special someone, or your boss. The only down side to this place is what I call the propaganda, ""SAVE THE FISH."" It's a bit much, all most in you face. After seeing the Blue Fin Tuna, it made me hungry, I went out for sushi afterwards. Eat more fish, besides it's rich in iron."
2438,2015-06-30,5,"First of all, whoever said that this place was small and was able to finish the entire aquarium in under two hours or less was probably not enjoying the aquarium completely. Tickets are a little pricy, but it is for a good cause. The money from ticket admission goes to helping the different wildlife programs funded in the aquarium. I had my college I.D. with me and was able to get a student discount, so if you have any type of student I.D., don't forget to bring it along!The aquarium, compared to that of the Long Beach Aquarium (for all the people from So Cal coming up to visit), is pretty big. There are a lot of nooks and crannies with cool types of fish. The Open Sea tank of the aquarium is probably my personal favorite. Turns out that there are some sharks from the wild placed in that tank for research and once a certain length are returned back to the wild as well as a school of sardines, a couple of Sea turtles, dolphinfish and more. Be sure to check out the feeding times as well! It's a lot of fun."
2439,2015-02-06,5,Had a nice day visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Saw the sea otters feeding and enjoyed watching them play in their pool.  Missed the seeing the feeding of the penguins even though it was fun to watch them play and swim.  The jelly fish rooms were amazing.  Loved the cafe on the water and enjoyed being there on Super Bowl Sunday it was quiet.  Good price and very clean.  Friendly staff.
2440,2009-04-05,5,"Wow.... we just got back from a members night where they just released a new sea horse exhibit.  This is truely an amazing display.  They show you such strange and unique varieties of sea horses.  There are these ones called a leaf dragon, and this looks pretty much like a piece of kelp.  I mean its truely amazing how nature adapts and to see science right in front of you.The also have close up pictures of the male sea horse giving birth.  This was seriously a trip... the footage was great and all in high def.So, lets talk about the event.  It was our first time at a Members Night and lemme tell you about that!  If you get invited to one of these you should definately go.  First of all they have an open bar...wine and beer.  And they pass around lots of heavy appetizers.  They had egg rolls, meat balls, lettuce wraps, a cheese station, and a great dessert bar. And most of the aquarium was still open, there were a few exhibits which were closed.  It was super cool to walk around the entire aquarium and be able to stand in front of the outer bay all by yourself!"
2441,2012-06-20,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the coolest places around!  I also believe it is the best Aquarium out of all the ones I have visited, including the Baltimore Aquarium.  Whenever I visit a new city I try to get to their Aquarium if they have one, it's just some corny thing I do with the family when we are on vacation because I just love the underwater world.  Now each Aquarium has its own special features, but this place was awesome.My brother and I took some of the kids here this weekend and we just had a blast!  My daughter loves to watch the live web cams of all the animals but actually visiting the place is so magical.  I think it would be so cool to live under the water like these animals do.  In my next life I hope to come back as a dolphin or fish, that way I could swim all day long and not have to worry about bills!  The fish are soo cool looking!  Some of them have very pretty colors and others are shapped stangly but all are very unique.  We are in the middle of researching what fish we want to get in an Aquarium for the house but I wish some of these fish were for sale!We got to see the Penguins eating and I know my brother loved that, the penguin is his favorite animal.  They are such cute animals and if you have ever watched animal planet it's rather different to see the male watching over the baby all winter long until the female returns.My nephew really enjoyed the Mysteries show they held.  We were going to ask them if we could get a copy of it but it slipped our minds when we were leaving.  Does anyone know if you can get a copy of that?  My favorite besides the fish was the sea otter.  It was a cool program and they are very cute animals.  They have so many events going on it so hard to keep up with them but I saw something about the underwater explorer.  Anyone from Yelp try this out yet?  I plan to call them this week to get some more information on it because it sounds like a lot of fun!I suggest wearing comfortable shoes, going early and planning your time wisely or else you will be running from each event and may miss some of event.  You should also try to get there as early as possible o you can see all the animals being fed, it's the best time of the day and the kids really enjoyed it.  I also suggest making a donation to save the oceans, I did and hope that everyone considers it.  If you think you are going to stop in more than once, then I suggest a membership, which is what my brother and I do.  You save money in the long run and will always have a great time no matter how many times you visit!"
2442,2010-05-31,5,"Penguins, rays, jellies, oh my! Or is it seahorses, otters, sharks, oh my! Oh however the saying goes the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must see... if not the only thing to see in this small town. Be prepared to be awed by the fascinating antics of ""wild"" animals. My favorite parts: kelp tank and jelly farm. It's like being eight again and on a class field trip, which just so happens to be the case during our visit. There were so many kids running around. The volunteers are very professional and friendly and knowledgeable. We ate lunch at the Portola Cafe in the aquarium. Prices ranged from $8-12 for a hot entree. Admission at the door is $30 per adult. Buy tickets at AAA and save $3."
2443,2012-01-16,5,"After reading unfavorable and mixed reviews, I went in there rather skeptical and wondering this was going to be somewhat of a waste of money. The facility is fascinating (from watching real life microbiotic marine life to seeing hammerhead sharks in a huge aquarium) and it is worth every penny.The highlights include the cute otters, the jellyfish (many varieties, colors, and sizes, including baby jellyfish).This place is certainly worth going to and arguably the best aquarium on the planet!"
2444,2007-10-03,5,"A stellar aquarium in a quaint town.At the edge of Monterey  near Pacific Grove, this gem showcases some beautiful creatures-big and small, colorful and dark, quiet and noisy.  It's greatly expanded & improved their space since I first visited in 1985.One of my favorites is the jellyfish tanks, so many jellies floating around like little see through ghosts.  And the big kelp tank.  It's a pretty soothing experience even with the barrage of people.Go and be a kid again.  It's great fun!"
2445,2015-06-22,3,"Its a great aquarium...beautiful displays, excellent educational facts...but for the price, there should be a little more to offer. A 3D ride, something...feed a dolphin. Still think its a very cool aquarium and we'll probably visit again."
2446,2012-01-04,1,"I love aquariums. I went to the Seattle Aquarium in Washington and it was absolutely amazing there. The exhibits themselves were amazing, it made it look like the animals and fish were having the time of their lives. I could stroll through the crowd of people and always find information on what animal I saw clearly.At Monterey however? My boyfriend and I went on a weekday at around 11:30, expecting it not to be busy. It was so crowded I couldn't see anything! Absolutely nothing. I think I got a glimpse of a sea otter once. I didn't even attempt to read any of the information because small children covered up anything that was at their level. And if the info wasn't at their level, the parents and their strollers blocked it off.I think we paid $60 to spend 20 minutes in there. Worst aquarium experience I've ever had."
2447,2015-04-06,4,The aquarium which everyone says is to die for was not to die for. I don't know what other aquariums people have been to but this is not the best place to go to. Slammed busy. It's pretty don't get me wrong but just not the best. I heard they do a lot of rehab here so that gives it an extra star. But to me an ordinary aquarium.
2448,2014-08-15,4,"The best aquarium In California!!! Surrounding location (Cannery Row) is just beautiful. The absolute key to a good visit is to GO EARLY. We arrived at 9:30am (opening time) to plenty of parking, no lines to enter or purchase tickets and easy access to viewing all exhibits. There is metered parking which accepts coins or credit cards but there was also a parking lot right on the corner of David St within a 3 minute walk to the aquarium where all day parking was $15. Great exhibits, my favorite being the new Tentacles featuring octopus, squid, and cuddle fish. The jellies were amazing with several species that aren't on display anywhere else. Live feedings and 15 minute video programs are offered throughout the day. They also have a scuba or snorkeling option outdoors where you can pay to have an instructor take you into tide pools which are at the oceans edge but secluded from the wildlife (by only a reef barrier) so no worries about shark attacks ;) youngest age allowed was 8 yo. Restaurants and gift shops galore. Our family had a wonderful time and will be returning. Downside was the crowds that appeared between 1 and 2pm which luckily we avoided as we were leaving. Exiting out the doors there was a line to enter the building which stretched up the street. Early or late arrival to have a pleasant trip. Little local shops for food, souvenirs and my kids fav pressed penny's lined the walkways. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was because how crowded it became, so much that anyone would have much difficulty in viewing any of the exhibits and the wait time to enter the building. Also, I felt the prices were too high considering we were able to see everything (less most of the auditorium programs and the live feedings) within 4 hours. This is a non profit organization so I assume the funds are used to maintain the facility which was worth the preservation and educational aspect that is offered."
2449,2008-05-26,5,"Of all the things do up in Monterey, the trip to the Aquarium happens to be my highlight.The admission price is stiff for coming here. I guess the $25 is worth it to maintain this place. It was just a lot more than I expected it.At first, I was a little bit moody about joining the tourists and walk station to station where each of the exotic fishes are at. Imagine that, me as a tourist considering I am one. I think the outdoor exhibition cheered me up a bit where I get to see some of the walrus performed. Then hitting the petting tanks had soothed away any resentment in reminding me on how I get to act like a kid. It let me pet all those little fishes and shells for a more hands on experience.My favorite part of the whole exhibit was the overhead tank where you get to see the magic of undersea surround all around you. When the lights dimmed, the fishes just swam all around the tank where it almost encompass you in a round circle. With the water so blue and the fishes so bright in many colors, that would just take your breath away.Seriously, you can spend the whole day here and wash your troubles away. I almost forgot how gloomy it was just like the weather and imagine how fun I had if I didn't let everything soaked in.It was well the admission price plus much more."
2450,2008-12-11,5,"I know zillions of people have probably reviewed the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but I feel like I have something special to offer to the reader:  I got to see two penguins mating.  Yup.  During regular business hours!  I really feel like I got my money's worth.Now, for those of you who read my other reviews (gawd help you), you probably already know that I bore witness to similar carnal activities on the part of two gorillas while on a recent visit to the San Francisco Zoo.  So now you're probably asking yourselves, ""Is she for real about all this wild animal love?  Does she give off weird phermones?!""I don't think it had to do with me.  I blame it all on my mother.  She was with me on both occasions, and I think the wildlife sensed the presence of an East Coast Jewish Mother and instantly the need to impress overtook them.  So they did what they did.I have to say comparatively speaking, the penguin relations were much cuter and cuddlier.  It looked like there was an actual relationship going on between the two birds, and that made me happy.  My SO took pictures of it.  I really should post them here...although I'm not sure if that'll violate the Terms of Use for the site?  At any rate, this was my third visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and as always, I had a wonderful time:  It's interesting, stimulating (apparently even for the penguins), and well-put-together.  It's also pleasantly WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE, although hard to get around on the weekends when there are tons of kids running around not paying attention to things like wheelchairs or power scooters.My favorites, in no particular order:  the otters, penguins, giant deep sea shark-and-tuna tank, outdoor viewing decks, gorgeous pink jellyfish, etc.!No trip to Monterey could be complete without a visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
2451,2012-12-06,5,"Best Aquarium I've visited ever. I grew up going to aquariums such as the Aquarium of the Pacific, but I am seriously in love with this haven. When I went, there was a seahorse exhibit, a section dedicated to the open ocean, a section with cute penguins, an awesome exhibit of jelly fish, and giant center tank with a cool mola mola fish (sunfish)  swimming around. I definitely found it well worth my money because it was super interactive. Every section of the aquarium had activities and buttons people could press while gaining new knowledge. I thought it was perfect for children and adults alike. Example: There was a small display set up where you could turn this wheel clockwise or counter-clockwise, and the direction of the ""current"" inside the display would switch. My (back then) boyfriend was super fascinated by how these sea creatures would reach out their feelers and feed off the plankton in the currents, but would automatically adjust the direction of the feelers based on the direction of the current. Ain't that neat? heheIf I ever feel like going to an aquarium, I would definitely visit again!!"
2452,2012-01-23,5,"Amazing aquarium.Spent about 3hours there and got to see all of the exhibits but would have liked to stay longer and stare at the giant ocean tank.  Ocean Tank: Ocean tank is HUGE and had multiple sea turtles, tuna, mahi mahi, a hammerhead shark and other aquatic life.  Amazing.  There is a seating balcony that is an excellent place to rest and take everything in.Seahorses: Large exhibit with multiple tanks containing seahorses and their cousins (sea dragons, pipefish, etc.).  Lots of tanks to see.  Another great exhibit.Jellyfish: Mesmerizing. The lighting makes the jellies glow.  Really amazing to see jellyfish up close.Otters: Tried to catch the feeding time but it was super crowded and hard to see.  Probably easier to see the otters when they aren't feeding or get there early to get a spot up front.Touch Tanks: There are multiple touch tanks filled with various types of seaweed, starfish other aquatic life.  There is also a touch tank for rays but they were all hiding in the far corner.  I guess humans are scary.There were also volunteers at a lot of the exhibits to answer questions about the exhibits which was nice.  They seemed pretty well informed and were very nice.Overall a GREAT experience.  Would definitely go back."
2453,2015-01-25,5,"My boyfriend took me here this past weekend.  I was born and raised in the Bay Area and had never been!  Entrance was a little pricey...$40 each.  I should have checked for a Groupon.  Entry aside, It was fantastic.  I got to watch the penguins being fed :)  And I got to see the sea otters.  They were so cute!  There were only three at the time.  One was swimming around, making it nearly impossible to get a picture of his cute self.  Another one was just lounging around and the third was something else; he was grubbing on ice cubes out of a bucket.  Too funny.  I got some beautiful photos.  Would definitely go back, but hopefully at a discount!"
2454,2016-11-16,5,"This place is AWESOME!!! My husband, almost two year old and myself went recently and we had a blast! So many exhibits to see, like hours of entertainment! We stayed at the nearby Best Western Plus Victorian Inn and walked to the aquarium so we didn't worry about parking. Also if you stay in a 'partnering' hotel you get a two day pass for the price of one! And kids under three are free! We just had the best time and felt like (with the two for one pass) it was well worth what we paid. They have tons of volunteers all over the aquarium ready and eager to answer any questions you have. Cafe, coffee shop and restaurant in the aquarium so it's easy to stay there all day. If you have little ones who nap there are several quiet-ish, very dark, calm places to sit and nap in a stroller or carrier. I highly recommend visiting the aquarium, so much fun for all ages. We can't wait to go back again soon!***even with amped up kids everywhere (they were having a field trip) my husband and I left feeling so relaxed and rejuvenated. The soft relaxing music playing while you're looking at all the different fish in a dark, cool, environment, almost puts you in a trance. It's other-worldly! (Literally heart rate slows and breathing depends. Freaking cool)"
2455,2009-06-07,5,"I love this place. So much so, that I bought my boyfriend and I season passes!It IS MUCH smaller than you remember from your 3rd grade field trip... but still pretty dang fascinating.  And I think it's a good detour from the Pier 39/ Alcatraz routine often associated with out of town guests. Take them here, then drive back via Santa Cruz... You'll be a big hero.The other Yelpers have already covered the aquarium pretty well... So I'm gonna geek out here for a minute and review their newest instillation: The Secret Life of Seahorses. montereybayaquarium.org/…While I was way bummed that they took out the jellyfish exhibit, I was excited to see this new chapter in MBA's story... so we packed a lunch and headed down 101 on Saturday.Loved it! I mean. LOVED IT! They did SUCH a good job. It looks totally different than the Jelly's Living Art exhibit. They've got it lined with this cool blue light and great faux wrought iron doors. The whole thing is like an underwater New Orleans for Seahorses. And it's really super interesting. I never knew how much I didn't know about seahorses. Cool facts, lots of really amazing looking little creatures, and really pretty environment. I think it's worth it to go JUST for this!But since you're going... might as well catch a sea otter feeding! They're adorable. Get there early and camp out by a window about 15 minutes before the feeding starts. It gets crowwwwwwwded! Oh. And the shows in the little theater... the sea monsters and jelly one are worth checking out.This is a fun activity, in a great little city that is both informative and fun. (And provides lots of cute hand-holding opportunities)  And you can feel good about buying a ticket knowing that it helps support an institution dedicated to the conservation of our bay and it's little inhabitants.  And they have student discounts and memberships. If you're in school... or just one of those people who is out of school but still hanging on to that student id for movie discounts... check it out!"
2456,2009-08-29,4,"Ouch, the price tag of admission.....no problem, make sure stay at least 2 hrs!!!anyhoo, the touch pool is pretty awesome.  one of the volunteers at the sting ray pool was giving raw shrimp and squid to patrons to feed...i was able to have a nice size shrimp and the string ray nibbled!!!  it was super scary, b/c the mouth felt all jelly like....but fun!!!  i love love love how kid friendly MBA is, so many volunteers who smile and are willing to help, even taking pictures!  there is a lot to do, and by far, our favorite exhibit was the jellyfish!  coming here made me wish i had kids....but MBA is awesome, b/c there are certain exhibits in which strollers are to be parked...none of that running over your feet and obstructing view crap....Although the first tank of fish we saw..mackerel and tony was already hungry =("
2457,2015-08-03,5,"This aquarium was a blast!!! It was beautiful, informative and fun! Great scenic views, we were able to see whales out on the ocean! Cool interactive exhibits- I felt like I was a kid again! Lots of shops and restaurants in the area (it's pretty touristy, but not bad for a couple of hours!), and you can leave and come back to the aquarium- just make sure to stamp your hand!"
2458,2014-10-08,5,Educational places that give me my childhood wonderment for a fleeting amount of time is always high on my list.  This place is very fun to hang out at.  I enjoyed looking at the Jellyfish exhibit they had.
2459,2015-02-25,5,"Classy, fine dining at the Monterey Aquarium...for lunch! Who would have expected such a delightfully prepared & pleasantly served midday meal! The fried calamari was light & tender and a generous serving of tartar sauce & the cod tacos were by far the most sophisticated fish tacos I've ever tasted."
2460,2010-01-19,5,"What a great  education and fun place to all ages at the same time! I really excited to come to this place even though it wasn't my first time, my last visited was on last Sunday. Even though it was rain but still got some crowded. I do really enjoyed the jelly fish. I highly recommended to everyone, this is a great aquarium. The Tickets are a bit pricey: $30.00/adult, but  for sure well worth it.  if you have a student id card present it, you will get discount."
2461,2013-01-21,3,"I would give this 3.5 stars if I could.I guess I am spoiled with the ATL aquarium. I was able to see all the exhibits within an hour and a half. If you go later in the day they close off some exhibits early (penguins and a couple others had curtains pulled) It does have a great view of the ocean on the observation deck though. My fav exhibits were the jellyfish and sea horses. The kelp forest is the biggest one they have that you can see from a variety of different spots. I also got to see the diver feed the fish :)So it is great to take kids, a lot of hands on exhibits for them (although during flu season I hope the parents vigorously washed their kids hands)So yes it was worth it to go see definitely when you visit monterey..and it Is right there by cannery row. (Look for the $10 parking in the blue building. ..)"
2462,2013-02-20,4,"Where else can you sea such a beautiful gallery of jelly fish?  For me, this was the best part of the aquarium. There were also seahorses, sharks, tuna, and a lot of other creatures to enjoy viewing.There were also some 15-minute programs.  I watched one about jellyfish and another about the mysteries of the deep sea.  It was very educational.  Where else would I learn that a school of jelly fish is called a ""smack?"" If you are a poor listener like me, it might be hard to sit still.  But you can learn a lot.  A lot of kids get really involved and there's some fun trivia or insight that staff members share.The Monterey Bay Aquarium has a lot to offer, but try to avoid crowded holiday weekends!  It was hard to enjoy it without feeling rushed.  It started to feel like a maze in there too. The cafe can be pricey, but fortunately you can leave the aquarium and come back if you get your hand stamped.  It's a stamp that can only be seen under black light.When watching the penguin feeding, expect to sit on the ground unless you come early enough to score a seat on one of the few benches.The tickets might seem pricey too, but there are discounts for seniors, students, and military members.  The good news is that the money is for a good cause.  There are tons of volunteers and staff who make a huge difference there.Other than that, enjoy the aquarium and the beautiful view inside and out."
2463,2012-07-02,5,"My boyfriend and I have been members of the aquarium on and off for years. We love checking it out every time we go to Monterey. We went again this past weekend and had a good time despite the heavy summer crowds and rowdy kids.If you're going to go, I strongly suggest going during the fall months on a weekday, if you can. There's less crowds, the kids are back in school, and not as many tourists. Plus, the weather is usually very nice and sunny during September and October. Those are my favorite months to go to Monterey because there is less fog than during the summer and it's generally pretty warm. You can also enjoy the aquarium without tons of screaming kids running around everywhere (well, unless there's a school trip at the aquarium... those can be hard to avoid unless you ask the staff in advance).We did go to the ""Jellies Experience"" exhibit, which was kind of a disappointment. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I expected more jellyfish and less interactive activities for kids. Also, some of the jellyfish they had there were already featured in their Open Sea exhibit, so it seemed a bit redundant to me. I really enjoyed their last special exhibit (the conservation one with the flamingos and other birds), but this one just didn't interest me that much. They also took out the beautiful tropical fish tank that they had in the flamingo exhibit, which made me sad.My favorite exhibit is still the aviary. The shorebirds (especially the snowy plovers) are so adorable! You can experience the birds up close and personal without any glass or wire to spoil the view. It's also an awesome place for photography. I also enjoy their tropical fish tanks and the sea otter exhibit.The only thing I really wish is that the aquarium had an adults-only day or night like the Cal Academy in San Francisco. That would be awesome. It's just really hard to enjoy the aquarium with fussy kids running around everywhere, screaming, and pawing up and banging on the glass of the fish tanks. If parents would discipline their children, that would be fine, but sadly a lot of them don't. So, I think an adults-only day or night would be wonderful."
2464,2009-07-26,4,"I'm a bit torn... I'm more into giving 3.5 stars.This place was great with the beautiful and fascinating jellyfish, cute and entertaining otters, awesomely strange seahorse exhibition and other fishies and sea creatures.....but it was on a very small scale.  (Given all of the stuff I've heard from people over the past 9 years in CA...I was expecting more.)  The price of admission for this place is a bit steep...at nearly $30 per person (adult!)  (Yes, even though we had the use of someone's guest passes on-loan..I'm still looking at face value.)The place was open until 8 p.m. on Saturday, but they closed down some exhibits (i.e. aviary) at 6 p.m.  Boooo!  Parking...I have no idea, as we parked elsewhere on the streets, since it was after the 'one-hour' limited street parking.  The gift stores = friendly service.  Nice stuff too.  Mostly kid-friendly.  Honestly, come here once or twice to see the animals, and check out their latest exhibit(s) but beware of crowds, children (unsupervised half of the time) and how the place is fairly small."
2465,2015-06-07,3,"My family of 4 went on a Sunday morning. Paid around $100 to get in. Parking was a little confusing, we ended up parking in a lot about a 10 minute walk away for a $20 fee. Very congested with tourists and strollers. The crowd is very blended with tons of different cultures. This place does have a lot to spark kids interests of all ages. There is a play area and water table upstairs along with an area to touch and observe sea life. Toddler friendly.I had a bittersweet experience because, though it was full of amazing creatures and facts, there were too many people every where. Guaranteed there will be a long line anywhere you go, even the bathroom. The free feedings  catch the attention of everyone, so if your not there extremely early you won't see a thing. If I go back it'll be during the week. I was told by a resident that during the week its calmer because there are no tourists. Apparently this aquarium is an international  attraction and not just a day trip for us folks in California. After words we took a 10 minute drive down to Lovers Point and relaxed on the beach, perfect for kids"
2466,2015-07-26,5,"I thought it was really cool how they educate you on what kind of fish are okay to eat and which are bad for the environment. I wish zoos did something like this, it was very impressive. I had a fun time here! I was kind of disappointed there wasn't a Sunfish. Oh well."
2467,2013-07-24,5,"The whole experience is fabulous. I love the local marine habitat exhibits, feeding time and the touch pools. We have been a few times and love both the jellies and the seahorse experiences. last time we went they had a small small great white in the big tank which was awesome! I could spend hours there. It's a small enough aquarium so you don't get totally burnt out by the end of the day, but has so many experiences and exhibits you feel like you've seen so much. I got a great video of a clam eating and stood under the waterfall. Just watching the sardines swim in a school is quite a treat.  When my daughter was little we got the pleasure of spending the night at the aquarium in front of the big open ocean tank and I have to say it was an awesome experience. It will always be a special place for us."
2468,2016-12-12,5,"I love this aquarium, I am a student at CSUMB and have a member pass and love how amazing the staff is and the different areas of the aquarium, it is absolutely worth upgrading to a season pass in place of a one day ticket. Come with family or friends, it's amazing."
2469,2015-07-22,5,"This aquarium is great! We have been to several big aquariums throughly the U.S. and this one ranks at the top! The exhibits are great and you can tell they treat their animals well. I loved all the info about the animals and also the tips on how to protect our ocean friends. It was a great way to spend a day in Monterey. We paid $130 for a family of four which was a lot, but I don't mind paying the price when I can certainly see what the money is going toward."
2470,2015-02-14,5,What a beautiful aquarium I have been many tikes and enjoy the new renovations keep it up MBA you will never cease to amaze me! Highly recommended to all ages!
2471,2015-06-03,5,"This place is so cool.  I've been to a couple big aquariums (San Francisco, Las Vegas, New Orleans, and Charleston) and this one is my favorite.  I could spend hours just in the Jellyfish exhibit.  They've got all kinds of sea life to look at...sharks, otters, manta rays, jellyfish, anemones, fish, squid, octopus, penguins, crabs, and more!  I wish they had turtles though but maybe I just missed that.  It's definitely an awesome place for kids to learn."
2472,2015-11-10,5,"Nothing better, go there when it is off season or the middle of the week. Worth every penny, plan to stay the entire day. So good my wife volunteers there, I will next year. Enjoy, a life time memory."
2473,2010-03-28,3,"My boyfriend took me to Monterey for my first visit and I insisted on visiting the aquarium. Everyone I know has raved about this aquarium and so when in Rome... unfortunately we were not impressed. It seemed better fit for folks with children. I have also been to the Seattle aquarium which in my humble opinion is much better, a fraction of the price, a fraction of the people, and better exhibits. Needless to say we were in and out in 1.5 hours. If you go, I recommend the jelly fish and seahorse exhibit and the large tanks in the middle with the sharks cannot be missed. They also apparently just opened the pink flamingo exhibit this weekend which sounds pretty cool. The aquarium also has good spots outside so maybe bring a snack or packed lunch to enjoy midway."
2474,2016-12-09,5,"Very nice aquarium, but a little expensive. Staff is very friendly, place is clean too."
2475,2012-01-13,3,"Who doesn't love beautiful marine life? It's incredible any way you look at it. Monterey bay aquarium does a great job with nicely set up exhibits and well taken care of facilities. The highlight of the trip was when my son and I got to touch starfish & sea urchins. The stingrays looked like they had it with people and were pretty much staying out of everyone's reach.It's nice to be able to just sit and look at one of these huge tanks, the longer you look the more you see and it's awe-inspiring.Another cool feature was the wave machine - you stand in a plexiglass tunnel and wave simulator goes off every min or so.Why I gave it only 3 stars...I paid $80 for tickets and barely saw anything. It was so overcrowded we couldn't get close to any exhibits. At one point we left and decided to come back later. Even later it was still crowded although not as bad. The sea otter exhibit was impossible to get to. So basically we spent a bunch of money and saw very little. Which is a total bummer since we were looking forward to coming here. Perhaps I'll figure out the off season."
2476,2015-07-14,4,"Very cool place to check out, especially the fact that they switch out the exhibits occasionally.  It keeps me coming back to check it out each year. I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes when I go, there's just too many people there. But it's really not the business' fault, unless you can say it's because they made it so cool that lots of people want to come. In any case, if you have never been here, you definitely got to check it out at least once."
2477,2010-12-01,4,"So far.. awesome! Lately, I've been making the trek up to Monterey from Orange County several times a year and I have had the opportunity to visit the aquarium at least once every year -- and the best thing about it?  The aquarium always seems to change a little bit every time I visit.This past time around, I made the 400 mile drive up to the aquarium (yes, specifically for the aquarium) to retake a picture I shot last year of their Outer Bay exhibit (the huge tank with a large seamless glass window).  I had taken a picture last year which ended up being surprisingly neat -- a shark coasting through a school of fish gave way in fear, almost as if there was a bubble surrounding the shark.  Anywho, I noticed a few quirks with the photo while editing (slightly blurry and slightly over exposed).  I knew I could get a better shot and recreating the shot would just be a matter of patience.   So I made the 5.5-6 hour drive with some friends of mine, specifically for this ONE shot.  Upon arrival I was excited, but come to find out, the aquarium has closed down that particular wing of the aquarium along with the large tank, for renovation purposes.It sucked big time.. but I wasn't upset.  I knew I should have called in advance, but I thought to myself previously, ""It should be ok.. what's the chance that the aquarium would close down a huge fish tank?  It was fine last year.""  Well, that was ultimately my fault.I was a bit bummed, but then again.. I was still in the aquarium.  So I took the opportunity to revisit all the other exhibits and even got quite acquainted with a penguin by the name of Messi (at least that's what her wing band says).   She was quite friendly, pretty hyper at the time, took interest in me and played around with me for a bit.. it was quite the experience.Overall, I still had an awesome time!  I talked to one of the aquarium staffers and they informed me that the Outer Bay exhibit would be closed until next summer, so for sure I will be returning later next year to retake the shot I most desire.  But to the rest of the aquarium, I still stand by my words in my previous review.. this is, by far, the BEST and BIGGEST aquarium on the west coast.  It can't be beat, there's just soo much to see and do.  It's super fun and you won't be disappointed either way!"
2478,2015-09-13,4,Jelly fishes and open sea section is the best. There's a section in which you can touch some wild fish and sea plants.Generally worth seeing..
2479,2016-10-11,5,This place couldn't be any more awesome! They have such a variety of animals to see and to touch! It has some of the most spectacular ocean views.
2480,2014-09-16,4,"This place is awesome, though I wish it were bigger.  Parking is a nightmare, expect to park far and take a shuttle there.  If it were just priced a bit lower, I'd be there more often... just wish they had a deep waters exhibit!"
2481,2015-05-23,5,"A truly wonderful place. In addition to the hundreds of sea creatures, docents, and exhibits the aquarium also runs several successful marine wildlife programs. See Saving Otter 501 on Netflix for example."
2482,2009-05-21,5,"I'm located in Suisun, meaning a two and a half hour drive.  My boyfriend and I decided to go on my birthday since it was also an extra credit assignment for our biology class.  Let me tell you!  The distance is nothing compares to the beautiful aquarium of Monterey!  I haven't been there since I was a little kid, so if you're planning on dropping by without knowing the new renovations then you're in for a surprise!  There's tons of parking structures located near the aquarium but they don't vouch for parking :(The cafeteria in the aquarium is kind of ""iffy.""  Bit having lunch in the dinning area was lovely!  Try to bring your own lunch because the prices of a sandwich is costly.  If you bring your children there make sure to keep an eye on them.  There are a lot of other kids that go there for field trips... so having your kid lost can happen."
2483,2009-03-19,5,"Wow! 525 reviews!Cleanest aquarium ever!!!The exhibits are all amazing, some creepier than others, but wonderful!The workers there were all helpful in putting us in the right direction.There are multiple parking lots around the area, so search around for the best priced one."
2484,2012-12-28,5,I missed the great white shark exhibit :(  This place is very educational and fun!
2485,2015-07-06,5,"Highlights: otters, penguins, jellyfish.  We got to see a baby shark still developing in the egg at the touch pool area. It's only about halfway and should still be there till at least December 2015. We have a toddler so we love that there are two large play areas for the little kids to explore. There's coloring and stamping and dressing up as fish. There's slides and tunnels as well. It took us about four hours to get through the whole aquarium including playing at the play areas and lunch. It was such a fun day!"
2486,2013-05-15,5,Fantastic aquarium.  We're local members and our daughter loves to go from exhibit to exhibit to point out the different creatures.  It's a great place to mentally and physically exhaust a toddler!  All of the staff are very friendly and helpful.
2487,2012-02-04,5,"This is a great place to visit. I've known adults to easily spend four hours here. With a toddler, we usually max out at an hour and a half, but not for lack of things to see and do. We're members, so sometimes we even just pop in for 15 or 20 minutes, which is also nice.Get there first thing in the morning, preferably on a weekday. Start at the Open Sea exhibit. At some point in your visit, be sure to make it to the Aviary and the Touch Pools. If you have kids, they could probably spend the entire time running around the Splash Zone. On a beautiful day, be sure to go outside, sit in the sun, and gaze at the water. I love this place."
2488,2013-01-23,5,"Buy the membership, you'll support the aquarium, the amount is fully deductible and you'll get you're ROI after 3 visits.  The Friday night event for adults is a must see."
2489,2014-08-17,4,"YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2014 38/100It had been years since I was last at the aquarium. I decided to visit last month with my one year old son and our mommy/baby friend. Although the aquarium is pretty great, it's also pretty hectic regardless of how much preparation you take. 1) It's CROWDED. Think shoulder to shoulder inside the exhibits. This makes it hard to really see the animals, especially for small kids who need to be up close to see anything. After paying $40 to get in, I want to be able to SEE what I paid for! 2) It's smaller than I remember....and seemed like maybe there should've been more to see?3) It's not the best outing for little ones (3 and under.) Navigating a stroller through the crowds was a hassle, and when my son wanted to walk around, I was constantly worried that he would disappear into the crowd & become lost. It's not a safe environment to allow little ones to roam which was sad for us. We had driven 4 hours to get here, only to find that the babies had to more or less remain in strollers throughout the aquarium to avoid losing them! 4) My son enjoyed touching the aquatic plants & watching the jellyfish & tidal wave tunnel the most. There is also a kids section which includes a fenced off baby area which our babies liked, but it really wasn't any different from an indoor play place closer to home. 5) The gift shop & cafeteria are EXPENSIVE!!! The food was decent..but pricey! I feel like I was probably expecting more which caused me to be a bit underwhelmed, so as long as you know that the aquarium is relatively small and has a few cool exhibits (no big shows, no whales, no sharks.) then you should have a better experience. I wouldn't recommend taking babies though, wait until the kids are over 3 and can learn from what they are seeing."
2490,2015-01-22,5,"I've been bringing my little girl here at least once a year since she was 1 (she's 5 now). Its a great experience every time. All the rooms have some sort of interactive displays for you to learn more about every sea creature they have in display. The 15-minute ""movie sessions"" are a great way to learn more about everything ocean related. This time we learned about the great white shark and monsters of the deep. The staff narrating the documentaries were extremely  friendly and knowledgeable. It became an annual ritual for us. Everyone in the family is sure to have a fantastic time here."
2491,2015-06-28,3,Overrun with tourists and the signage was horrible. Got lost several times. You can't knock how amazing some of the sea creatures are but the obvious neglect left me somewhat sad for them. Don't waste your time at the theater. The show was annoying and obviously to further the research more than entertain the audience.
2492,2011-12-28,5,"I adore the Monterey Bay Aquarium!  I spent so many weekends coming here as a kid when my folks had a family membership.  My top exhibits:1. Otters!!! How can you not fall in love with these incredibly cute animals?? Be sure to get a good spot on the upper level early on to catch the feeding ""show.""2. Tide Pool.  I remember waiting with rapt attention for the big CRASH as the wave came tumbling down.3. Sting Ray Pool.  These creatures look like they are straight up from another planet.  So ethereal and dangerous!4. Touch Pool.  You haven't lived until you've touched a Sea Cucumber.And as far as museums go, the cafeteria has some pretty tasty food (though very expensive) and the gift shop has a HUGE selection of stuff (also very pricey), and the view from the deck outside is lovely."
2493,2015-01-20,5,"This place is not to be missed. We took our two girls here last week on vacation and made many memories. The jellies were our favorite. It's laid out great, not too crowded and perfect for families. We spent about 4 hours here and that seemed just right. Make sure to make this part of your vacation."
2494,2012-06-29,5,"One of the best aquariums in the United States, need I say more?  I would call myself a connoisseur of aquariums and I would agree that Monterey Bay is the crème de la crème.  Make sure you arrive early as it will take you almost 3 hours to completely go through and more if you have children.  Good thing is that by the time they are done they will probably be worn out. They have everything that any aquarium nerd would want.  Grandiose exhibits, a stingray petting area (because these creatures love being touched by strangers), feeding times, a beautiful jellyfish exhibit, and penguins.  I could go on and on but other Yelper's have already covered all these bases.  The final word is that if you love yourself go to Monterey Bay Aquarium."
2495,2012-01-24,5,"An hour and a half drive each way.$15 for parking in a lot nearby.$32.95 a ticket (if you have AAA you can buy it at one of their locations for $3 off a ticket)I've visited this place twice in 2 years :DThere isn't much more I can add to the 1,200 plus reviews.  Its clean, well maintained, 2 gift shops with the most adorable stuff animals, and a food court that I haven't tried.They have such a variety of sea animals and exhibits, its really worth the trip.  If you haven't visited this aquarium.....check out their website!!!  I've been to a few aquariums and this one definitely takes the cake!!I would avoid holiday weekends if possible.  Its already busy as it is on weekends that I can't even imagine how the holiday crowd is."
2496,2015-08-27,5,"Words cannot explain the experience of visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  It is as close as you can get to actually donning SCUBA gear and getting in the water.  At $40 per head one might think them a bit over-priced, but I would beg to disagree - they were worth every penny.  The two-storey multi-room tank, the ""open ocean"" tank, the ""touching"" areas, the many, many live displays.  I cannot being to describe this place.  Must see.  I will again.  It's in Cannery Row, so many good restaurants and also some art galleries close at hand."
2497,2009-04-15,5,"Seahorses, Penguins, Otters, Oh My!The new seahorse and seadragon exhibit is amazing and brings new light to protecting these graceful creatures.  The leafy and weedy seadragons are so fascinating, I could sit and watch them float around for hours.Penguin Fix!!  I adore penguins and coming here a few times a year to say hello to my friends ""Pringle"" and ""Susu"" bobbing in front of the glass."
2498,2015-08-26,5,"Amazing!  It's a full day to take everything in.  The jellyfish exhibit is so cool.  If your looking for a get away with the kids, that's reasonably priced, the aquarium is an excellent choice.  A good time for both adults and kids."
2499,2013-10-06,5,Beautiful aquarium.  Had a fantastic time!  Make time to be at the feedings - great way to see the animals!Jellyfish exhibit was awesome!
2500,2012-09-06,5,"Absolutely BREATHTAKING!lets be honest, the whole city is built around this aquarium, and for good reason! There is a reason why it's the best aquarium in the world.The selection of animals is great, and their exhibits are impeccable! Plus they're really doing some great conservation and research so its great to support them.One thing to note. Once you come here, every other aquarium will seem sad."
2501,2015-08-25,5,LOVE THIS PLACE...so do my kids!  Jellyfish exhibit was awesome and we loved the Open Sea tank.  Will be going back and buying a membership...very educational for our two toddler aged kiddos one of which loves marine animals!  The baby (almost 2) loved the tanks and looking all the fish and the other 3 1/2 year old loved the wave tunnel and the touch tanks.  So spread out it didn't feel so crowded even though there were a TON of people.  A bit hot inside but probably because it was warm out...Monterey County residents & businesses don't know what do with a day over 75 degrees!  LOL!!  All we had to do was step out on the huge balcony looking out into the bay and we were good!  We ate desserts and my kids had pizza...everything was tasty...especially the carrot cake!!!  So worth the cost of food/admission and the 5 stars!
2502,2015-05-05,5,"This aquarium is such a treat! Not only does it have features with some uncommon attractions (sea otters galore!) but it also has attractions that get displayed in vibrant and in most cases extremely kiddo friendly ways. There are a few displays of huge glass walls that show off a large array of sharks and bigger fish that have perfect mood lighting and calming music that make it easy to sit and watch them. It is a fantastic visit if you're in the area and well worth the admission, especially considering that cost directly assists with the wildlife preservation efforts of the facility."
2503,2014-08-28,5,"This is the best aquarium I have ever been to! I was able to get a student discount so my ticket only cost $35. Anyways, there are a lot of things to look at and I like the set up of the aquarium because it feels organized and not overwhelming. You know you're going to get a chance to look at everything without feeling anxious because of the separation of areas. They also have an outdoor area where you can just sit and relax, staring at the ocean. This aquarium is beautiful! Be forewarned, this place can get pretty packed."
2504,2012-02-04,5,"Must visit at least once! I thought that maybe i wouldn't enjoy it, since I am not a child nor have children, but I was wrong! It is a beautiful, well-thought out and well-executed.. So many things to see, much better than Long Beach Aquarium. It has so many huge aquariums,and all ofthe  areas are designed with cohesive themes. My favorite was the seahorse exhibit. Not only did they have a large variety of seahorses, some I didn't even know existed, but the area is surrounded by rod-iron like decoration with an intricate seahorse design, and  the magical idea of seahorses is enhanced by the subtle, and whimsical soundtrack that plays in the background, and the effect of shadows and light. Really a treat!"
2505,2011-10-18,5,"Amazing, Excellent, Awesome!  Worth the cost of parking and worth the cost of admission.  This aquarium blows Long Beach aqarium out of the water.  It's just effen great.  There's thousands of reviews... I'll keep this one short."
2506,2007-01-06,5,"Moon Jellies prompted me to ask for a season pass to the aquarium for Christmas. Today I used my passes for the first time. I laid on the floor and just watched the jellies ebb and flow around me.  I'm sure everyone thought ""weirdo!"" but I don't care.  They're all from Montana anyway. Nothing rules harder than this place.  And Moon Jellies are my personal heroes."
2507,2015-08-22,4,"Super busy,  but lots of great exhibits. It was nice to have a high adult to kid ratio, because this place gets so busy, it can be easy to lose kids."
2508,2015-05-02,4,We really enjoy going here! I love the stroller parking at the beginning of each section so it doesn't get super crowded. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about the animals. I loved getting to know more about helping the enviroment and what I can do to help keep polution down.
2509,2014-07-08,5,"I love it here!! We spent about 4 hours here on July 3rd and although it was busy with the holiday weekend all of the guides, staff and volunteers spent time answering everyone's questions and they were very knowledgable! My favorite part of the trip was watching the diver at feeding time in the kelp forest tank! We were able to see how the fish eat in the ocean!! Last time we visited was about 5 years ago and coming here again it all looks new!! I'll be coming back again! Just wish it wasn't so expensive!"
2510,2015-09-29,5,Amazing!!! Real fun experience and a must in Monterey! Take about two-three hours for a visit.
2511,2012-10-21,5,"I came here on a cold September  Monday (when is it NOT cold), and the crowds were thankfully thin.My fiance, a marine-lover, was in heaven.The volunteers have a wealth of information. Pick their brains.Go to one of the feedings."
2512,2012-03-10,5,"This is, by far, the best aquarium we have ever been to. They have a ton of stuff to do and see. There are little tanks, bit tanks, and even a huge multi-floor tank. Not only were we entertained here, but we learned a lot too. This is ""edutainment"" at its finest.They have some pretty cool shows at the theater tooAs mentioned, the only bad thing is the ticket price, but I guess they can charge as much as they want, being the best aquarium we have ever been to. Did I already mention that? Besides, the ticket price includes ALL of the theater shows and activities which are usually extra charge at much inferior aquariums."
2513,2015-04-26,5,"This place was awesome! Bought a membership as well! It's very educational. Our favorite was the jelly fish, so coo! Will be bringing my kids here often..."
2514,2012-03-15,5,"Easily the best Aquarium I have ever been to. This place is huge and has some GREAT exhibits. They have pretty much anything that is on or in the water. If you are in the San Jose or San Fran bay area, Definitely check this place out. I will say that the only downside is the cost of admission but that is to be expected. The parking also can be hard to find during peak season as well, DO NOT park in any of the surrounding restaurants as they WILL tow you away."
2515,2013-12-23,1,Seriously the ticket price ($35) should be below $15. Just put you in perspective: Bronx Zoo is the largest city zoo in the world. It has everything this thing has plus 10 times more animals. Bronx Zoo price? $17. Seriously it is a scam and pure rip of peoples money. You have to try really hard to find things to do to fill your two hours!!
2516,2015-08-14,4,The aquarium is great with lots of exhibits unfortunately it is fairly crowded which can be frustrating. I came on a weekday during the summer so it was pretty packed. The tickets seem high priced however for a one time visit it is worth it.
2517,2005-11-12,4,"Loved this place. Generally I get bored very easily, but I truly found it to be amazing and interesting."
2518,2008-02-26,5,"I love this aquarium.  This past trip I was a bit dissapointed that my favorite exhibit (the touch pool of bat rays) had been cut in size by so much it no longer functioned.  However, the exhibits on JELLYFISH more than made up for it.  The otters were more than cute and we were lucky enough to see a newborn baby floating outside on top of her mom."
2519,2008-12-23,5,"I've been going since it opened.  My aunt lives in Monterey & would get free passes in the beginning.  She's now a member, and I recommend people sign up.  The members only entrance is worth it's weight.I've enjoyed watching the aquarium grow over the years.  I love how they've added in monitors with cameras so the adults standing back can also see what's going on.  It's worth the money as an adult for the exhibits & totally worth it for all the hands on activities for kids.Believe it or not, this is a fabulous place to have a wedding.  We've attended two.  One was held outside with the reception in the main area by the kelp beds.  One was held in front of the kelp bed with the reception over by the members entrance."
2520,2009-04-07,4,My last visit here was in 2004. The fish people had collected a baby great white shark and put that baby in the main tank where it swam around and around and around and around. I was in awe and could hardly pull myself away from the exhibit. But it was also sad to see such a great creature kept captive. Eventually they did let the thing go and off to feed on some unsuspecting suffer in Santa Cruz.
2521,2009-04-22,4,"This was only my second time coming here and my hubby's first time.It was a good thing we came on a weekday, otherwise it would have been a lot more crowded, even though it still was. This place has a beautiful collection of jelly fish and their even more beautiful when they glow in the dark. They had Blue fin Tuna's, bright colored fishes, sea otters, penguins, sharks, sting rays and even touching ponds.My favorite of course are the cute sea otters and the penguins we we sent the most time viewing and playing with. Last time I was here though, it felt a lot bigger to me, maybe I just remembered it as having more exhibits? I don't, whatever it was, definitely come check this place out and don't forget to go down to the beach after for some nice camera shots!"
2522,2014-08-25,5,"I ALWAYS take the kids here whenever we are in California. Such a great place to learn about the ocean. We just love having lunch on the patio area overlooking the Monterey Bay. I was disappointed to find that they no longer have the seahorse exhibit but that still doesn't make this place any less spectacular. The Jellies Experience is still a favorite but there are so much interactive and hands-on activities for children. You'll find the people who work here are very passionate and very friendly, they make me want to work there, too."
2523,2012-01-01,3,"CROWDED, CROWDED, CROWDED!!! Parking sucks too. But of course, the aquarium and their staff are quite nice so I guess they deserve at least 3 stars.... Despite the fact that kids and parents are rude and inconsiderate alike. However, it's a great place to take your kids if you don't mind getting jostled around! Or, just take them out of school one day and visit the aquarium when it's not as busy, I suppose I can still enjoy the exhibits when I can actually see the fish, haha..."
2524,2014-06-17,4,"Had gone here as a kid and didn't care for it much. But we decided on a Monterey trip with our son because we knew he would love it. It has changed SO much since then. The place is huge, 2 stories, and offers so many different types of marine animals. They even have touch pools. We really enjoyed our trip here. If we lived closer would definitely invest in a membership."
2525,2013-09-19,3,"Having grown up in the Bay Area, I've been to this aquarium countless times.  It's an amazing  place but was was disappointed that the pice was now $35.00 per adult.  Having worked in the parks to reach underserved youth,  I'm consciously aware that these prices will exclude many visitors. My husband & I are regular's at the Academy of Science. We appreciate the different options they have to accommodate diverse audience, such as: the once a month free entrance, the weekly Night Life ( for adults only & 1/2 off regular rates) and the yearly public safety discounts.  Another suggestion that the CA Academy had implicated is allowing access to the gift shop without needed museum admission.  I wanted to buy a piece of jewelry for a friends but was  informed that  I needed a admission ticket. I found this to be a bad business decision because  I did not need normal museum admission & only had an hour to spare, due to the 6pm closing."
2526,2012-03-03,5,"Best aquarium in the nation, hands down. And at like $33, it's a much better value than places like Chicago's Shedd Aquarium. This place has everything, including an entire section with special displays that change periodically, so you can check out something different on your next visit. If you're into animals, the ocean, or learning at all, then it will be very hard not to love the Monterey Bar Aquarium."
2527,2008-08-04,5,"I'm sure everyone's been here by now, but if you haven't then you need to. If you have been here and are not members, then I would highly suggest donating a little cash toward the cause.As long standing members - I highly suggest getting a membership as the benefits are outstanding; regardless of whether it pays you back or not. If you're a senior or student you can get a membership for like $50.If you're a member and you have someone in your party that needs to buy a ticket you can express them through the members only entrance around back too!The aquarium has been getting so much better recently with the millions of dollars worth of upgrades, but they really need to educate their visitors and enforce the rules to better protect the aquatic life under their care - such as not annoying kids banging on the glass or their inconsiderate parents who refuse to take their camera's off flash because the picture comes out a little hazy. With that said, I never get tired of coming here and with the three floors of outside decking and a restaurant with a view it's always nice to just stop in even if it is just for a quick snack."
2528,2013-10-10,5,"I really love this aquarium, and ever since I got a membership pass here I'm able to go as many times as I want for an entire year. I've came here numerous occasions with friends and family and I've always had a fantastic and educational time. I love how the members have a separate entrance, so you don't have to fall in that ridiculous long line that always forms outside every morning. I came to Monterey w my friend for his homeboys wedding and we wanted to explore the city a little bit so we ended up going to the aquarium. I already had my pass from going with my family, and he had already bought his ticket so it literally only took us less than 5 min to get in. As for the aquarium, it really hasn't changed much from the last time I went.I really enjoy the fish and penguin feeding, so I always try to catch those even though it gets really crowded cause of all the families w kids there. We went on a weekend, so that's probably why it was really packed. I also love how they have an outdoor sitting area overlooking the ocean, where you can sit down get some fresh cool air and have lunch. You can bring your own food or they also have a food court. No sushi restaurants though, cause you don't wanna be eating that at or around an aquarium. LOL. Anyways, this place is always a fun time for family and friends and it's pretty much located in Cannery Row where there are plenty of shopping sites and places to eat! Great place for a quick get away since it's only about a 2-3 hour drive from the bay. Oh and if you can pay a little extra, get a membership..so you can go all you want throughout the year. I believe mine was only about $20-30 more on top of the admission price, totally worth it if you're going to go a few times, especially if you have kids in the family!"
2529,2015-08-08,5,"Love love love the Aquarium. Thank you for doing all the research, rescues and providing so much information that kids and adults can understand and appreciate. We are lifetime members....."
2530,2012-10-24,5,"Yes, this is a pretty pricey aquarium but if you have a few hours to spend, it is worth it!! By far most extensive and beautiful aquarium I have been to! Like most tourist attractions, it is way less crowded on weekdays than weekends.They have recreations of old ships and giant hanging whale models hanging from the ceiling as you enter. Lots of awesome photo ops here! I love anywhere that will let me pet stingrays, as well as touch starfish, sea anemones & a variety other sea creatures! The stingray tank is kind of wide, so they can avoid you but they tend to swim around in circles and you get the chance to touch the edge of the water as they swim by and feel there textured skin. :) The staff here is friendly and doesn't mind sharing info about all the animals and plant life here. Hundreds of BEAUTIFUL JELLYFISH here!  Makes for gorgeous photos with the orange and white jellyfish against a  bright blue background. Stunning! This exhibit alone makes it worth it! Two giant amazing Octopus' that will move around and suction to the glass so you get to see them up close in a way you probably have never before. This is really cool! They are fantastic creatures!The seahorses are soo cute/pretty!There are large tanks that have big schools of fish who swirl around in masses around the tank making a beautiful shimmery sight with their iridescent silvery scales. Large sharks and sea turtles can be found here too!  The penguins and puffins are super cute and quirky! Sea otters are playful and fun to watch :) They have an outdoor deck area that overlooks the bay. It gets pretty windy and cold out here though! The cafe is out here too where they serve clam chowder and other light lunch food. Definitely worth going if you are in the area, and even if your not, its worth the trip out!"
2531,2008-11-30,4,"Lots to see here. Penguins, otters, jelly fish, octopus, birds, etc. I overheard a woman say there were going to be sea horses next year.  I enjoyed my visit here. I was really looking forward to seeing the otters but unfortunately they were being lazy and just sitting in their buckets! But there were baby otters in another exhibit but they were sleeping. The jelly fish were also amusing to watch and the splash zone was cool!We had a guest pass here so only had to pay $22.95 for a student rate. Not bad but I wouldn't return until they add some new exhibits for the next year!Also there's lots of nice views here of the bay. Great for pics!"
2532,2012-02-24,5,"Beautiful and breath taking! So much to see, play, read, gawk, stare, and touch.... One day is not enough! The beauty of the sea and how funny fishes are. Oh man I want to go back!! I am so going back =) This place gives you a better appreciation of sea life. I'm not one who loves to read but the informational plaques on the walls intrigued me. I LOVE THIS PLACE! (yes I am yelling since it's all caps ). Also, the big tanks are like watching IMAX HD hahaha it's so breath taking. Probably the only time I would ever be in close contact with a shark. nI loved the seahorse exhibit. You can not get bored here there is just so much to do."
2533,2014-07-09,3,"Very pricey, way too crowded and not that impressive for its size. If you don't like crowds or kids I wouldn't recommend going."
2534,2011-11-23,4,"The counter staff at the entrance was not too friendly and seemed like either a.) they were cooler than my wife and I. or b.) had better things to do than explain anything well.  We WERE going to buy a membership but the guy seemed like he would rather not explain the different options and just pointed to an LCD screen and said ""read"".  We almost did not even buy the tickets...but whatev...get a new job if this one is so annoying.  They wonder why membership is down?  This is why.  We wandered in to the main areas and a man pleasantly told us about the live music in the main area by the awesome otters....  we then started to have a good time and interact with the pleasant staff member around the area.  We dig aquariums and we has a blast here."
2535,2012-05-31,5,"This is really an awesome aquarium in the San Francisco bay area.  Although its a long drive from San Francisco to Monterey (about 3 hours), you will enjoy an amazing variety of sea life in the Monterey Bay Aquarium.There is a recent Jellyfish special expo, the exhibition is both educational and incredibly fun. I like its big kelp ecosystem tank as well. In my experience, one day will not allow you to visit the entire aquarium if you are gonna listen to the guided tours.  If you are staying in a hotel, ask them about the Monterey Bay Aquarium two-day ticket deal.  This way you will have much more time to enjoy the exhibits."
2536,2014-10-12,5,"Came on a Sunday afternoon on a glorious California day. Yes, the aquarium was busy but not crowded because this place is HUGE. You might find it pricey at 30/person but you wull get you moneys worth. Great exhibits, fantastic viewing opportunities and loads of hands on kiosks  especially if you have kids. For kids and teens, they will find this place facinating. I highly recommend this aquarium."
2537,2008-08-19,5,"My first visit to the Aquarium was a blast. Its great to see animals that you thought you'd never see in your life time up close. My favorite exhibit was the JELLIES. Which this is the last year they will be having that exhibit, it will be moved shortly. So stop by and see them before they go. I also really enjoyed staring at the Sea Dragons. For an extra ten bucks you can get a 50 minute behind the scenes tour, well worth it.  Mr. Jones our tour guide was great and full of knowledge. He even let us feed some of the Fish. I think he should play on Jeopardy, cause he loves to ask jeopardy style questions. HAHAHA. I think what else is great about this place, is that they have in and out privileges. Spend an hour or so leave for lunch and return to see things u may have missed the first time around. If it was a little closer I would return sooner rather than later for another Visit."
2538,2012-08-15,5,I loved loved loved the new jellyfish exhibit.  I was waiting for Go-Go Dancers to run through.  LOL!  The Seahorse exhibit is fantastic too.  And of course don't miss the fish feeding in the kelp forest with Q&A's.   Regular line is long & slow.  Recommend buying tickets online.
2539,2012-06-04,5,"this place is FREAKING AWESOME !!!!! OMG i love this aquariumstarfish, tuna, sea horse, omg writting this made me want to go back :) it was good time with my babe :) cool experience."
2540,2015-07-27,5,"I used to go there to zone out at the shark tank and get hypnotized by the surroundings, but the last visit with two teenage girls we had the most fun in the jelly fish rooms. It was super fun and beautiful"
2541,2016-09-17,1,"While this may be the largest aquarium in california, it is no longer a good experience. Why? TOOOOO MANY PEOPLE. you will get pushed around, hear constant screaming and crying children, dodge stroller. it's complete chaos. Finger print smudges everywhere, and its nearly impossible to get a good view of the fish. Think about going early? ha, there is a long line at opening and it floods up to capacity fast. People don't follow rules with flashes every 2 seconds. people will get up in your space a lot. There is no parking, so be prepared to walk. it's become a tourist TRAP. you want to pay 50 bucks for an experience like this? There are far greater aquarium experiences at other locations around the united states. DO NOT travel to Monterey just for the aquarium. If you like a crowded experience and don't mind shelling out a tone of cash to pick up influenza or pin worm, go right ahead. If it was empty, this would be an amazing place, but it's not. it needs crowd control. Oh, It likely breaks fire codes, that's how many people are there. Don't go on weekends or holidays. go on a Tuesday morning. Oh, if you are wondering of a better fish petting experience? go to Moody Gardens in Galveston. it's empty and you can pet all the sting rays you wish. it's a smaller aquarium with a much better experience. and you can catch an Imax and get free parking. People are in denial if they are giving this 5 stars."
2542,2015-02-23,5,"Had an awesome experience here! It can get a little crowded but the aquarium is definitely worth the wait! Make sure you catch the feedings for the otters and open sea exhibit. They do such an amazing job incorporating fun themes with the different exhibits so that you are not just going from tank to tank looking at animals. The jellyfish were all in a ""groovy"" 70's psychedelic exhibit which worked very well, and the tentacle creatures were all set in a pirate theme. The entire aquarium can be throughly enjoyed by kids and adults and it is definitely a humbling experience to see just a fraction of amazing creatures that the sea has to offer."
2543,2015-05-22,5,I would definitely consider checking the jelly fish exhibit (if still there). There was also a big circular shaped fish tank which had what appeared to be sun fishes and other large fishes. The place appeared clean as well.
2544,2012-06-08,3,"Cons: Super crowded; super expensive; smaller than other aquariums I've been to, parking will be difficultPros: Well cared for animals, facility is well maintained; staff is attentive and helpful, lots of learning stations; the wave tunnel is just plain coolThis would be a great experience/adventure to take 6-7 years olds on if you had no other ideas and were in the area."
2545,2014-01-03,1,"Been there, done that. Yes, it is a BEAUTIFUL aquarium, but the social messaging is distracting and, quite frankly, annoying. Do we need to take care of our world? Absolutely....but this should just be a SECTION of the aquarium. There is more focus on conservation rather than the actual organism or fish. ""Science"" seems to have been hijacked by extremists."
2546,2012-07-16,5,"I love love love love LOVE this place. This place is gorgeous. It's breathtaking. I love the ocean. It's one of the things that broke my heart most about moving to Michigan - no ocean (shut it, the Great Lakes don't count as ""beach""). The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the most amazing places ever to learn about the ocean, conservation efforts, endangered species, and get to see some pretty freaking cool fishies (& non-fishies!). I love the otter exhibit, and the penguins, too. The prices are a little steep, but it takes a lot of money to keep these animals alive and to continue the Aquarium's conservation efforts and research. The one thing I adore about the Aquarium, too, is that they occasionally have Great Whites in their habitat. Aquariums can't keep them in captivity for long, but we still don't know much about them, so the Aquarium will occasionally bring one in (often times one that's been abandoned or injured), study it, tag it, then release it. I keep missing them when they have them, but I'm looking forward to the next one (in case you can't tell, Great Whites are my favorite sea animal...)!"
2547,2014-06-13,5,"Took kids and grandkids.  Expensive, but worth it.  Everything is first class; exhibits, staff, volunteers, and facility.  Viewing areas were magnificent, educational opportunities abound, many hands on areas.  Good for a day's outing. World class."
2548,2009-03-04,5,What can I possibly say about the MBA that 517 others before me have not?It is simply a must-see - multiple times if you can - before you die.The work they are doing to preserve and conserve the marine mammal population is important and worthy of support.And dang-it those otters are just soooooo cute!
2549,2009-12-10,4,"Been to several aquariums around the world and this is arguably the best. I think the one in Sydney Australia might be better, but that's just my opinion. Tips Go in the afternoon ( after lunch if possible ). Kid field trips usually taper off by then I've found. If you have kids, or do not, you don't want to be here with hundreds of field-trippers. Parking can be dicey. They do have pay lots a few blocks away which is the easiest option. One thing, if it's cold and raining they have TERRIBLE curb side passenger pickup. There is ONE stall in front where it's legal to pick up people and it's usually occupied. The best strategy may be to park in the Bus Loading Circle ( you'll have to move quickly if a Bus comes) and wait for your party to come out. Then just double park in front and load up passengers. It's not a fun experience. Food - There is a place on Cannery Row called Paradiso. It's right over the water and they hand out free Calamari coupons. Very good."
2550,2015-02-17,5,Worth the drive from the Bay Area for sure.  Avoid the weekends and holidays as the place gets extremely crowded.  The food options inside are not good.  Great kids zone!
2551,2012-11-07,4,"I don't think I am an aquarium type person because I thought it was ok. I just bought the tickets since we have never been. Price is kinda high, $30 for student discount. I think this place is more for kids. It was cool to see all the different creatures and animals though. I really liked the giant wall sized tanks where they had the bigger animals like sharks. Oh and before I forget! Parking is a B****!!! Only street parking, and good luck! Unless you pay $20 or more for valet or parking in a private garage."
2552,2013-05-16,5,"One of the best aquariums we've ever been to. Based around 2 two storey buildings and housing 2 massive tanks full of awe inspiring animals, the Aquarium has a full range of exhibits, lectures and feedings (they even have an SMS service for impromptu feedings like say if a pod of dolphins swims by the outdoor balcony!)We especially liked the sea otter exhibit and educational video."
2553,2012-01-16,4,"Came here over MLK weekend to check out the aquarium....Driving over from the peninsula didn't take too long.... 1 1/2 hour drive.  When we got here, parking meters cost 1.50 per hour and there are also parking lots ($10 for the day).  Decided to park a few blocks away in the residential area where there are no signs.  Free parking.....  walking time is about 10 mins.As we walk in, the guide gives me a map of the aquarium, so, it's relatively easy to go from area to area....  There are different exhibits available, from the the giant sea (where you can see many specimens of fish, turtle, etc) to the otter exhibit, the plant life, the penguins, so, there are lots to see.  They even have a 'child' center for kids to play and learn with educational games.  While it was fun to see, the exhibit is definitely in my opinion geared for parents to bring the kids to get an educational experience.  Nothing wrong with that!  We went thru all the exhibits in a couple of hours.  Definitely interesting and would bring back family in the future."
2554,2015-03-27,2,"I was very disappionted in the aquarium.  I had such high hopes for this aquarium but it was a let down.  I enjoyed the jell fish exhibits and that was about it.  For what is there and the price, it is way over priced. There are better aquariums."
2555,2015-07-12,5,One of the finest aquariums in the country.  You can spend about 4 hours and not see the same thing twice.  Go early and one weekdays if you can.
2556,2015-02-10,4,I went here a few limes when my kids were younger. Had Abalone for the first time it was great. The kids and i really enjoyed it.
2557,2009-02-08,4,"Based on exhibits and animals alone, the Monterey Bay Aquarium deserves 5+ stars. Built in one of the original Cannery Row buildings (they have pictures of the original cannery building, showing how true to its predecessor it really is), the aquarium is perfectly situated on Monterey Bay. The sea life offered is extraordinary and will keep adults and children entertained for hours (you could easily spend half a day here) and the aquarium offers ample outdoor areas to look out over (and appreciate) the pristine Monterey Bay. The onsite cafe offers healthy lunch options (unlike some other kid-friendly attractions which offer hot dogs, macaroni, etc.).Unfortunately, the aquarium is not perfect as it charges an exorbitant fee. $30 to visit an aquarium when you can pay $15-20 to visit comparable aquariums like the one in Seattle. I know the aquarium uses some of it to support sustainability, conservation, and research programs (which I certainly appreciate) but to build that into their fees doesn't seem like the right way to go about raising money. I'm sure it turns away many people who are interested in learning about our oceans and who might leave the aquarium with a better appreciation for them."
2558,2015-05-09,5,The best aquarium I've ever been to! Truly a local and national landmark
2559,2016-11-04,5,"This place is the best! Such a wonderful time for the whole family. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful and the staff are so friendly! If you're ever in the Monterey area - you need to go - you won't regret the money spent!"
2560,2012-06-06,4,"Fantastic Aquarium, probably the best on the west coast. A nicely diverse selection of plants and animals, though mostly of the local variety as a good chunk of the tanks are conected to the bay (wouldn't do to have Caribbean fishies getting cold ass Pacific Ocean water). The uniqueness of the Kelp and Open Sea tanks make it a must visit for anyone with interest in aquatic animals."
2561,2016-04-04,5,This an amazing aquarium. I'm not sure if it is because it is in a great little Oceanside town or the fact that it is literally built on the Ocean- but it has a wow factor and spectacular ambiance. It's location on Cannery Row yields a very long stretch of delicious seafood restaurants and shops to enjoy after your visit. The aquarium has fantastic areas for littler kids to play and explore and learn. My 2 and 5 year old were in awe our entire visit and especially liked the deep water exhibit which tank seems endless. My 8 year old really liked the hands on tide pool and really enjoyed learning about all the creatures. The cafe they have is very good if a little higher priced. If you look at the schedule for the day you can catch a few feedings and the movie of the day they are showing. You can go outside and utilize the binoculars to spot some otters or maybe even a whale. You can for an extra fee scuba dive in the actual ocean which is made into little tide pools by the rocks. It seems the annual pass may be worth it price wise even though you. An see everything in one visit.
2562,2009-11-09,4,"I made a day trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium when I was living in the south bay with a couple of friends also in the San Jose / Santa Cruz area. Between the 1 1/2 hour drive both directions, spending  4-5 hours in the aquarium, and sitting down for lunch in the cafeteria at some point, this made a perfect day-long adventure. Monterey Bay Aquarium is pricey, but the money goes to a good cause. They also offer student, senior, and youth discounts, which is nice. When you come to the aquarium, you're met by an impressive gigantic wall of tons of fish. This is one of the most impressive parts of the aquarium and really gives you an idea of the massive size of this place. Keep going through, and you're met by a great number of treasures, from penguins to sea otters to areas where you can touch crabs, and, yes, tons and tons of fish. Make sure you view the daily feedings they offer while you're there as well as take advantage of some of the interactive activities. Ok, so they're really oriented at kids, but I think they're fun for all! If you truly take advantage of all the aquarium has to offer you could be most of the day.I can't give Monterey Bay Aquarium 5 stars because, as impressive as it is, I still felt it didn't compare to my childhood fantasy aquarium, the Shedd Aquarium. In fact, I was a bit disappointed during my visit because they lacked things such as dolphin tours and exhibits. That said, it is still the best aquarium on the west coast. If you're in this part of the country and haven't visited, what are you waiting for?"
2563,2014-10-26,5,Really cool aquarium. Big with a bunch of exhibits and plenty staff explaining things to ignorant people like ourselves. Moral of the story is eat your own plastic and stop littering. Just kidding. The jellyfish exhibit was really soothing. Makes me want to fall asleep. Wish I had a custom tank in my room filled with jellyfish. That'd be something. The price seems a bit steep but you will easily be able to spend a couple hours here. Parking is a bit of a pain but very abundant.
2564,2010-06-20,5,"Have been coming here for years! Field trips in elementary school, middle school, high school, and now college dates! This is by far my favorite aquarium ever! For sure, way better than the Aquarium of the Pacific down south. This place is big without being overwhelmingly so, organized by different ecosystems, educational and extremely fun! You can go with the family or with a date.Favorite exhibits include: sea otter, jelly fish, and deep ocean tank. The feeding times are also fun to watch, especially the sea otter one. The also have changing exhibits, but the permanent ones are the bestI wouldn't recommend the restaurant here because it's a little overpriced, but what museum/aquarium isn't? Plus, it goes towards the aquarium and its conservation/research efforts, so if Im starving, I don't mind helping a good source. The newer exhibits seem a little...more child oriented, but hey, it is a family place after all. Plus, all the colors make it pretty :)Note: my favorite fish, the sun fish (aka mola mola) is currently not in the deep ocean fish tank...she's at the vet because the shark keeps on harassing her. So if you're going to see the sun fish (like i was)...call ahead! Haha."
2565,2011-10-20,5,"Loved it. It does seem pricey at $30/adult and $20/kid but we still had a great time. Plenty of cool exhibits, especially the Open Sea one. I could spend hours just staring at it, but had a 3 yr old with me who has a limited attention span and can't sit still. I like that they interactive (touch) exhibits and things for people of all ages -- even babies and toddlers.I was expecting larger exhibits, like a dolphin show or something. But, that's because I grew up in the DC area and the Baltimore Aquarium has one. Regardless, this aquarium won't disappoint. It's a great way to spend an afternoon.There are plenty of great photo ops, like the sea jellies or any of the school of fish swimming around. The feedings (such as the one for the penguins) are cool and informative and kids will love them. They also have tours available for an additional fee -- Behind-the-scenes tour, feeding tours, family tours, etc. -- but be aware that some have age requirements and most sell out quickly. I'd suggest going on their site and making reservations well in advance of your trip. We got their right when they opened and most were already full.4.5 Stars"
2566,2016-03-24,2,"Not really worth it for $35 per person (with student id). We drive over 5 hours to get here, our expectations were really high as it's supposed to be one of the better aquariums. To be honest, it was a good size aquarium, but the same type of sea life everywhere you turned. The octopus was cool, but 4 of them in 4 different tanks??!! Same with the jellyfish. There were no sharks, unless you count the hammerhead and baby shark swimming around. No tunnel, which is weird. We went on a Monday, it was so crowded and so many damn kids running around, I wanted to trip them, lol. The area was stuffy and smelled of B.O. We won't be returning, I'll go back to SF."
2567,2012-01-30,5,"Love this place, it's beautiful and sometimes cramped when it's the weekend so staring at jellyfish and sea horses is limited to how rude you want to be. We have the year passes and they've already paid for themselves in two visits on top of it being completely tax deductible.     The Open water exhibit is one of my favorite along with the jellyfish against the bright blue backdrop. Amazing.What's not amazing are people who just walk around with cameras taking pictures of the animals then walk away. These people tend to be pushy and changes the ambiance from slow and relaxed to frenzied. I'm all for people taking pictures home with them, but you're not even taking the time to enjoy them while you're here. anyway...Go on a Monday, super calm. Moms with cute kiddos age 1-4 who are super into the exhibits. The older  kids are presumably in school. Winning."
2568,2015-05-02,3,"After all of the hoopla about it being the ""best aquarium in the world"" and seeing Yelp reviews, my husband I decided to go.We've been to other comparable aquatic parks and aquariums. Like Aquarium of the Pacific and SeaWorld and Santa Monica Pier Aquarium. MBA was not so much more stunning that it could be $40 entrance fee. We were not incredibly impressed- at least not at the level that some reviews and the ""best aquarium in the world"" title suggests. The Giant Pacific Octopus was fantastic."
2569,2012-06-15,5,"I could spend all day in front of the kelp forest.  The rest of the time you'll find me in front of the jellies.  Don't miss the sea horse world -- such a lovely installation.  Love the sense of harmony that abounds -- everyone is here to enjoy the beauty of the sea, up close.  And if you or your family loves it, just become members -- if you visit more than twice a year it pays for itself, plus helps support the mission of the Aquarium."
2570,2015-07-02,5,"Wow!  Best aquarium I have ever been to.  I was busy the entire day: from 9:30 am to 6:00 pm.  Wonderful exhibits.  The sea otters were great.  The penguins too.  Excellent exhibits:  the kelp forest, tentacles, the jellies exhibit, splash zone.  All very educational.  The food area was good too.  I recommend the clam chowder."
2571,2015-07-02,3,"Best aquarium Ive been to but nothing spectacular.  The jelly fish exibit is very cool. I got aeason passes anyway. In a hot day its nice to come hang out though. It is a bit crowded & there isnt really a flow of people, hust people randomly walking around lost & bumping into people or just stopped while people are trying to walk by. Parking is bad too."
2572,2014-07-11,4,"So much fun! Hadn't been in years, still awesome though. Great for kids; obviously.  Little pricey as its 40 bucks per adult. 30 would be better. Got there when opened and had little wait getting in. Was a Friday though."
2573,2014-12-25,5,"I love this place. I live near Los Angeles, so I frequently go to The Aquarium of the Pacific. This aquarium seems to have so much more! I loved it! I know that it is pretty expensive at $40, but I think it is worth it. We bought our tickets from our hotel and we got 2 days for the price of 1. I highly recommend doing that especially if you have small children. We didn't get to see everything we wanted in 1 day because of naps and our kids got worn out. The jellyfish exhibit is amazing. There are also tons of places for the kids to play and do some hands on activities. If you're in Monterey, this place is a must."
2574,2016-09-03,1,"This place is definitely over rated. If you have kids, maybe it's ok. I would not recommend here if you have been to a couple of other good acquraiums in the nation. Tickets are $50 per adult with what I considered limited offering. Don't come on Saturday  (don't know about Sunday) as you will see absolutely nothing."
2575,2010-08-08,5,"Aquariums are beautiful but questionable machines. They have a myriad of pumps and apparatus to create a gravity defying marine environment above sea level and on dry land. Reverse submarines. They are marine zoos, perhaps less harsh as the inhabitants are less sentient. That said (and zoos have their place too), they are great! Even essential. And they are the essential place to learn first hand about what's in our oceans without a snorkel or tanks. This aquarium's most epic feature is the deep kelp forest tank, recreating a lot of the rich marine environment off the Cali coast.But this review is not about that. This review is about the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program. montereybayaquarium.org/…It's a mobile app, a business card size pocket guide many seafood stores provide, and an Internet resource.There are a few organizations working in the sustainable seafood space. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program is one of the earliest. They have primarily a documenting and educational focus on fish species and locations. They are the knowledge base, and a guide to restaurants moving toward sustainability.They are complemented by supply chain certification groups, there is plenty of evolution yet to be done in that space.The aquarium is a great place to visit and a great place for children. It's very crowded weekends. Recommended for in person visits and for their seafood program, available worldwide on the Interwebs, which will hopefully preserve the aquarium from becoming a zoo for extinct ocean species."
2576,2015-06-24,5,"The restaurant here is kinda pricey, but it's totally worth it. Not just the taste, although it was pretty good. But the view is the best part! You can sit near the windows and be practically on top of the ocean. If you watch the ocean even a little bit, you'll see sea otters popping up and playing. What a cool experience! The aquarium itself is pretty cool too. My little ones loved the kids area. Get to the sea otter tank early, it fills up really quick before the talks there"
2577,2012-08-02,4,"Fun place to spend an afternoon, especially if it's chilly or overcast outside. We enjoyed the jellyfish exhibit, the giant octopus, the seahorse exhibit and the deep sea. Not a full day excursion for adults, maybe for families with kids. Pricey at $35 per adult."
2578,2012-02-17,5,FUN! Great exhibits and informative.Highlights: We learned a lot about sea horses. We ended up talking to a volunteer who keeps them as pets. You would be amazed to learn how much care they require. Seaweed and stingray are generic terms for the plant and fish.
2579,2014-09-06,4,"I HATE zoos and aquariums, but I had a lovely time here. I never would have gone had I not been in a group that wanted to go, but I'm glad I did. It's well-curated and the fish seem to have enough space to swim happily. The jellyfish experience was definitely the highlight for me."
2580,2006-08-09,5,"I touched a bat ray!!!  They're soft and pretty. I also touched a sea cucumber.  They're squishy and neat. I haven't been here in years...  it was great. I loved the jellyfish exhibit, especially the gooseberry jellies.  They're like little round disco marbles.   I loved the Outer Bay too.. with the crazy sunfish and giant tuna.  All the shark symbolism in different cultures was fascinating as well... the different masks, dances and other ritual acknowledgement to the Shark God.  There's so much to see here that we became members on the spot, knowing we'd be back.   We couldn't see everything in one day.   Too many people (even though we went on a Tuesday), too many screamin' mimi children, and plus we had a guest with us so we were on her schedule too.  I want to come back alone sometime and just explore.   A tip... if you forgot to buy your tickets online and you think you'll come back often, become a member that day.  You can skip the line, plus there are all sorts of member benefits (unlimited free admission, special events like a Halloween party, aquarium sleepovers, jazz nights... , and no waiting in line) and you're giving money to a good cause.   Tax deductable too!"
2581,2007-10-28,2,"The aquarium has taken a real downturn in recent years. On one hand, they now have an area that's just for kids, but then they charge way too much for families to actually come. They used to have a really cool cephalopod area (yes, I'm a bio student) with cuttlefish and a red octopus and more, and they took all of those out and now just have the nautilus and a giant octopus. Apart from the slightly disturbing thought of where all the missing organisms have gone (was there some sort of platinum aquarium sponsor sushi night that went horribly wrong?), it seems odd to take animals OUT of the aquarium when you think they would be putting more IN, especially for the money they are taking in every day. The aquarium used to be one of my favorite places, and now it's a tourist place with new age music and the actual environmental and biological information tucked away in corners or on plaques with the writing small enough and the lighting dark enough that only those who brought their miner's hat and a magnifying glass can actually learn anything. This used to be a five star, and compared to what it used to be I would now give it a 2.5, but I'm rounding it down to 2 since they consider two dollars off a 24.95 admission to be a student discount.   However, if you have not been, there are still a lot of really cool things to see and I would recommend going at least once in your life. If you go early enough you will be able to pet the bat rays (they stay over on the far side as the day goes on to get away from the kids and loud people). And PLEASE pick up the little cards they have (FREE! WOW!) that tell you what fish are better to eat and what ones to avoid for ecological reasons."
2582,2013-01-19,5,"We spent the entire day here (opening bell to literally being escorted out at the end of the day!) and that gave us just enough time to see everything without rushing.We went on a Thursday in January so virtually no crowds to contend with - I cannot imagine what this would be like at the height of summer with severl hunderd little ones running around, so plan accordingly if you can.Lovely variety of exhibits, lots of educational information geared both towards adults and children (honestly -we enjoyed the kids stuff nearly as much if not more in some cases - ""Draw Your Own Jellyfish"" anyone???). We were able to leave the property & have lunch at a nearby restaurant (totally touristy Bubba Gump - but there are quite a few other choices) but it appeared as if the on-site cafe offered good, if pricey, options. You can get stamped for a return entry so make sure to do that if you leave.We loved the jellyfish experience and the seahorses as well. The otter exhibit was closed for refurb when we were there - but we were able to go out on the patio & spot otters in the wild with the provided binoculars. I even spotted a mama & baby so score!!!I would absolutely recommend this attraction for all ages, and would say plan on devoting an entire day to see & absorb everything that it has to offer. We are so happy that we made this the focus of our short time in the area."
2583,2015-02-28,4,"$39.95 for an adult so kinda pricey in my book. Great views, awesome exhibits, especially the jellyfish. Will recommend to others to visit!"
2584,2013-10-11,5,"Holy Mother of all things that are Awesome!  This place is a must-see!!!Let's get the bad out of the way first: I went here on a Saturday when it was jam packed with slimy kids and annoying tourists.  Some of the displays were ""inactive"" and many of the  glass panels were dirty.  Other than that, this place was one of the most spectacular sights I've ever seen!  I hadn't been here in about 15-20 years and I forgot how awesome it could be.  The jellyfish were out of this world!  Just being in front of the GIANT ""Deep Ocean"" tank makes you realize how small and  insignificant you are in relation to the Blue Planet.  My favorite sight was probably the Bluefin Tuna in the ""Deep Ocean"" exhibit.  Seeing their grace and beauty make my jaw drop in amazement and wonder.  I could go on and on about all there is to see, but why not just save yourself the reading and GO HERE NOW!  AWESOMENESS AWAITS YOU!!"
2585,2014-12-12,4,"Beautiful. We especially enjoyed the second floor jellyfish area. So peaceful, so beautiful. Lots of large tanks as well as small tanks to make this a very educational experience."
2586,2012-07-27,5,"This place is incredible, over whelming and stunning to mention a few terms. It is a must see for visitors from all over the world, and must see again and again for those living in California. Every time I visit the aquarium I am overwhelmed to speechlessness considering the beauty of the facility, and of the diversity and beauty of our oceans. The mission of this place is to  educate us about our oceans and protect them and I am a member and will continue to be a member forever. Thank You Monterey Bay Aquarium"
2587,2009-11-11,5,"Wow!  What an amazing place!  I've heard the hype surrounding the Monterey Bay Aquarium for as long as I can remember.  And as I was taking a recent road trip up Highway 1 on the California coast, I decided to add an extra half day in just to check this out for myself.  And I must say, it was well worth it!  Absolutely extraordinary!  The monterey bay is well worthy of it's reputation.  Never been to an aquarium quite like it.  Huge underwater displays showing glimpses into the life that goes on under water that you'd never otherwise be able to see unless you were in..oh..I dunno...a submarine with windows??I had to ask questions of the staff a couple of times and found them all to be wonderfully helpful and informative.  I think that all of the staff here must have training in teaching because it all comes so second nature to them.  Even when I was asking questions not related to the Aquarium (like where I could find the nearest bank of america...) they were on top of it.  Fantastic!My favorite parts were the very popular jellyfish tanks and the wonderful exhibit on Seahorses.  Even though I was there by myself, I could certainly appreciate how the Aquarium was set up to be equally enjoyable to both Kids AND adults (or at least helping adults to feel like big kids...;-)Only downside:  The price.  It's a bit pricey.  But then, it is a pretty big tourist destination - so I guess it's par for the course in that dept.  Great cafe for lunch, great views of the Monterey Bay all around, and very helpful and friendly staff.  Can't wait to come back with my family some day!"
2588,2015-07-27,4,"I love this aquarium!  We have yearly passes - the only way to go, it's too expensive to do it any other way.  This aquarium has a lot to offer, my favorites are the auditorium presentations and member nights!  That is when it's best to see the aquarium, nice and quiet!  I try to go on weekdays sometimes but they have lots of busses with kids coming through.  Mornings are the best time to go, right when it opens. My three-year-old son loves the jellyfish!"
2589,2016-08-07,1,"What a rip off. The tickets are $50 for adults and $40 for students if you can get the tickets for about $10/pp then maybe it would be worth it. We went to the aquarium as part of our stop coming down from Santa Cruz. We were a little nervous on that it closed at 6:00 and we got in at 3;00. Well guess what??? By 4:30 we had seen everything!!! There aren't a lot of exhibits and for the price it's the biggest rip off. So disappointed. Save yourself the money and enjoy the outdoors of Monterey, you won't be disappointed."
2590,2014-05-22,2,Nice for kids. Only for kids. And 40$ per person is ridiculous. The jellyfish aquariums are impressive but the rest is not as beautiful as you have seen in similar places (fly to New Orleans and be amazed).
2591,2014-06-17,5,"Bring hand sanitizer and parents please control your children, wait your turn rule had never been heard of here... My pic is a flapjack octopus!!!"
2592,2012-12-04,4,"Good day out however SUPER expensive I think. We were very lucky, we had passes from a friend which saved us $70. The exhibits are excellent, the gift shops are cute and the experience was definitely one to remember. We made it in about 1 1/2 hours although you could easily spend a few hours in here."
2593,2015-06-08,5,"My wife and I visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium on a summer Monday.  Adult admission cost approximately $40 per person.  That fee permitted access to almost all attractions at the aquarium.  Popular add-on tours (60 minutes) are available for $15 extra per person, but those tours sell out quickly.  We were unable to book one because they had sold out by 10:30 in the morning.Overall, we -loved- this visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium!  The exhibits are extremely well done.  The tanks are large, clean, and easily visible by visitors of all ages and heights.  We particularly enjoyed the otter, penguin, tentacles, and famous jellyfish exhibits.  There are many volunteers and staff members wandering the floors to provide interesting tidbits of information.  Plan your visit around the feeding time schedule to see a lot of lively fish.Bottom line: My wife and I will make a special visit to Monterey to see this aquarium again.  It is great fun for guests of all ages."
2594,2015-06-08,4,Really liked this aquarium. It had a lot of interactive things for small children yet was not childish for the adults.
2595,2010-07-18,5,"My favorite Aquarium out three aquariums I have been to. Better than the one in SF Pier 39 and the California Academy of Sciences. I like how there is a free trolley that takes you from the cheaper parking to the aquarium. It is so big and have so much interesting animals that it totally makes the 25 dollars worth it. We spent like 3 hours here. There are penguins, otters (sooooooooo cute), flamingos, jelly fish (stunning), touch tanks, etc."
2596,2012-06-17,4,"Pretty cool jelly fish collection, haven't been here in ages. But good to check it out once in a while.  The surrounding places to eat are meh....really tourisy, which i'm not too much of a fan of.  Have a snack and a beer at bubba gumps right before you go in so your not feeling too hungry during the trip, and you'll feel a little buzzed too while watching the sharks, sea horses, jelly fishes and an octopus."
2597,2015-01-04,5,Always a great trip here. The displays are well maintained and the staff is very friendly.  It's crowded for sure but very easy to spend the entire day here.
2598,2016-09-15,4,"Very fun time. Enjoyed the feedings, they are a must do. Too bad there were no great white sharks during our visit. Loved the otters and fascinated by the jellies..."
2599,2012-04-02,4,"Every visit we came here was more of an experience for the son to learn more about the marine life. The only problem was the drive there and back would take us about 2 hours each way. Is it worth the money? Sure, and thats why we bought the season pass for the year, which is cheaper than buying a ticket alone, if you're planning to go more than once.This place is busy on a weekday, especially on a weekend, it's crowded with kids & adults. So come early if you're planning to walk around the aquarium afterwards, and bring cash for the parking. Overall I'll give it 4 stars :]"
2600,2012-04-18,5,"The word ""amazing"" gets overused these days, but could not be more appropriate for this place. I'll say it again - this place is amazing!! During a recent trip to the Central Coast, one of my most anticipated stops was the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and it does not disappoint. Ask me which exhibit was my favorite, and I honestly could not tell you. They were all amazing (yes, there's that word again).There is a circular room stocked full of live sardines orbiting endlessly  - a particularly creative way of displaying them. There are jellyfish of all different sizes, mesmerizing viewers in subtly glowing tanks. There is an oversized window into an enormous tank with sharks, tuna, sea turtles, and multiple varieties of seafaring creatures, including the oddly-shaped sunfish. There are fascinating seahorses, otters, and a giant display containing an entire kelp forest full of fish indigenous to the area. Take your pick - any of the exhibits have the potential to thrill you, as it did me.Rarely do we land-loving humans get to witness life in the vast oceans that cover most of our planet. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the few places we can do that. If you ever get a chance to visit, don't pass it up! You will be amazed."
2601,2009-05-31,5,"Really not much that I can say that hasn't been said already about the aquarium.It's simply beautiful and well-designed. Very clean environment. Everything from the exhibits, to the bathrooms and stair rails are in pristine condition. Can't say much for some of the people who visit, but that's to be expected when mingling with the masses.Last time I was here, it was the jellyfish exhibit, now it's sea horses who have their own little display. Both were amazing. Of course there are all the usual displays that I've seen many times over, but they never get old. Anyhoo, if you want a gorgeous look into our coastline's ecosystem, this is a must for all ages."
2602,2011-09-06,5,"I have been to so many aquariums and this is pretty much the best one!Not only is it huge but the service here is excellant. I love the volunteers here. They have so helpful with everything and even when you don't go up to them, they come up to you and just randomly give you very insightful information. I paid the extra $12 for the behind the scenes tour as well as an extra $12 for the feeding 2 fish exhibits. It's pretty cheap considering the behind the scenes tour is an hour and you get to see how they maintain the tanks as well as some getting up close to some tanks. Feeding the fish is kind of whatever but def fun for the kiddies. Both very informative!They have a baby great white shark on display with now. Lots of fun fish to see and I was able to spend about 5 hours here between watching the fish feeding to the tours. Great outdoor areaFood: It's pretty decent though sandwiches and salads are around $10.00Parking is not provided but there are some covered structures that only charge $10.00 for the whole day! Fun tip: the aquarium is built out of concrete and can stand an 8.0 earthquake! It was also first funded by Hewitt Packard. Will def be back!"
2603,2015-05-30,4,"A great place to visit when in the bay area. Only drawback I found is it is a bit spendy. We purchased a year membership, which practically pays for itself after three visits with our family. I loved the jelly fish and octopus exhibits. My kids liked the wave tunnel and the observation decks."
2604,2012-02-25,5,"I love this aquarium.  I have been going to this aquarium since I was a kid and for a while got sick of going here because all the school field trips every year seemed to be to this aquarium.  Fast forward about 20+ years and I am now bringing my son to the aquarium.  If you live close enough, I would highly recommend purchasing the annual membership for $175.  The $175 is 100% tax deductible and the money goes towards a great cause of marine conservation efforts.  Considering admission is $32.50 per adult, it is well worth buying the membership if you plan to frequent this place.  The exhibits occasionally change which keeps the exhibits fresh and new so you don't get bored of the same old stuff.  The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about the marine life and animals.  The exhibits are also very interactive.  You can touch bat rays, touch little crabs and starfish.  It's really awesome for kids to get some hands on learning.  Also, there is a play area for toddlers and they can touch water and play on an area that feels like a waterbed.  One thing to keep in mind, the summers are VERY busy and crowded and it is very difficult to see the exhibits with so many people around.  Hence, the membership b/c during off season, and early morning or before closing during the weekdays, it's almost like you have the whole place to yourself.  We will definitely be renewing membership here.  We love this place!!"
2605,2012-07-09,5,It was way too crowded for me too enjoy everything but this is an amazing aquarium.
2606,2014-02-18,5,I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! It's a great facility and all the exhibits are laid out well. Just be sure to avoid the weekends where its especially crowded. Try to buy tickets online ahead of time so you can avoid a potential long ticket line. I love watching the big tank with the pacific sun fish and I love looking at all the jellyfishes. I am always up to go here whenever I plan a trip to Monterey. Oh and be sure to check out the Seafood Watch educational material and app. Great insights on the types of fish we consume in our daily diet.
2607,2016-04-11,5,"Big fan of this aquarium, a close enough drive from Reno. Not too expensive and I love how they always have a different exhibit to see. Their fish and sea life are all well maintained and happy. The establishment over all is very clean and the staff are very knowledgable, they can answer just about nay question you have. Love that! The have a great touchy feely area for kids.....and adults too! It's a huge place, so take your time and truly just wander through and indulge yourself in everything ocean. You will learn so much from this experience and take home with you all the sights and smells and maybe a little stuffed animal from the gift shop.  Week days are a bit better than weekends as far as wait goes. Check with school times as dar as spring break. The whole family will love it. Go outside for some fresh salt water and check out all the sea lions and otters that hang out there. The first time as a child, I saw how an otter eats his mussels, too funny!"
2608,2016-07-29,5,Always fabulous!! Love the otters!!! Great place for all ages. Enjoyed exploring the newer areas of the aquarium.
2609,2010-07-07,4,"Aquariums are all not that great.. but only because i been to the one in Long Beach near my home. However this aquarium is much more crowded and fun. There are tons a cheap - pricey food places around it. I went early morning with my family, and really it is for all ages. (Your parents, Or your children) We spent quite a few hours on here. There is such a wider variety of sea creatures, fishes, and even birds.  My personal favorite parts were the jelly fish, ALSO AS SEEN IN WILL SMITH'S MOVIE ""7 pounds"" !!! yepp :))) and i like the penguins ahah. I believe there is a fee, but they do have promotions online. I went free with my family.This is definitely what should define, an aquarium. Reminds me alot like seaworld for some reason but with a better crowd. Parking is a bit of a bother.. We parked a block over and it was crowded as if it was a tuesday night on main st on hb, some sort of block party event. The best time to go is in the morning/early afternoon when they have lil fun things going on outside of the aquarium, and by the time you finish you may be hungry to eat at the places around it in walking distance. You can also play by the ocean near it as well. I believe we came back in the evening, and there was wine tasting (free) and music and such going on. But i didnt get to participate.... being that i was with my parents. hahaha.."
2610,2012-01-01,5,"I hadn't been here in over a decade but heard great things about this place and was definitely not disappointed!  While other aquariums leave you thinking, ""that's it?"", the Monterey Bay Aquarium leaves you saying ""wow!"" more than once.  The vastness of the large open sea and kelp exhibits is amazing and the jellyfish exhibit is almost supernatural with the beautiful jellyfish looking like they're floating in the air.  Of course, the sea otters are as entertaining as usual and a definite favorite for everyone. My husband is a tropical fish hobbyist and he loved seeing some of the fish we have in our tanks.In addition, the staff there was great.  I got food poisoning from eating fish and chips at Cannery Row Brewing Company (see my bad yelp review and don't eat there) and it took effect when I went back to the aquarium after lunch.  I was stuck in the bathroom and couldn't move because my stomach was in such pain.  The aquarium's first aid/ security (thanks Tom and staff!) took great care of me and knew what to do to help make me more comfortable.  They even provided a wheelchair to help to get me to the car and get some fresh air.  AND...even though they had nothing to do with the food poisoning, they provided complimentary passes for me and 3 other people (they asked me how many passes I wanted :) )to return and enjoy the aquarium when I was feeling better!  Talk about great customer service!!This place is not to be missed! I highly recommend for everyone!"
2611,2015-03-23,5,"First time going and I fell in love! Best family trip ever! Kinda pricey but got a discount thru my bank.. $200 for a family of 8.. Not bad for an all day adventure.. :-) pack up some goodies if you're on an extra tight budget & you're good to go! PLENTY of activities & things to do to keep the little ones (& the big ones ;-P) busy. so so much to see inside the aquarium (3 floors of fun!!) something mesmerizing in every section.. Awesomest welcome with the staff showing us jelly fish jars.. The mini wave tunnel/ bubble just fascinating!! (try not to flinch!) WOW at the plethora of different fish!! AMAZING! The open sea tank was HUGE & u can even sit back, relax & admire it from the balcony.. The hammerheads, jellyfish, octopuses, anemones, seahorses- just beautiful!! And then outside-old timey feel of the town filled with delicious aromas, plenty of restaurants & affordable shopping spots & we can't ignore the simply beautiful Cali weather & beach down the way.. :-D Sooo much fun, you wont regret it & you will definately get your money's worth! Definately planning on going again soon for a more thorough visit.. :-)"
2612,2011-12-02,5,"Who doesn't love the Monterey Bay Aquarium? We were able to purchase slightly discounted tickets through my husband's employer, which lessened the blow. I think most people arrive when the aquarium opens at 10, we arrived at 1130 and parking was a little tricky.  The lots nearby can get expensive so we ended up driving out a bit, found street parking for free and walked back along the bay.  Even saw some dolphins out in the bay along our walk! We spent the entire day there. Ate lunch at their cafeteria and did some shopping in the gift shop.  It's really magical to be there right before closing because the place is practically empty!  We were able to get some beautiful photographs of us with no one else in them! Their habitats are always so beautiful.  I was sad that there was no sea-turtle in the main tank, but it's just an excuse to come back again soon.  We watched the penguin feeding and our 9 year-old was captivated the entire time. If you're going to watch a feeding, get there early.  It gets packed!!!"
2613,2011-11-18,5,"A must place to see before you die!  Amazing aquarium.  Most notable spots are when they do the feeding and you could see how the fish swarm like their dancing together, the jellyfish arena and the mighty big octopus of which you can only view, no flash picture taking. Parking is up the street from the aquarium and it's an easy walk to the aquarium."
2614,2014-10-12,5,"Love this place, so much to look at. So much fun with the family. Grest memories when I was a kid. Always fun to see the sea, and the animals. Everyone as far as staff is very knowledgeable and helpful with questions about any exhibit.  If they do not know the answer they make sure to find out for you. Very educational,  great family day out."
2615,2012-04-29,5,"While the Monterey Bay Aquarium is fairly expensive (32$ per adult, 30$ per teen, and 20$ per child) It is also the best of the bay and provides a really unique experience. It is great for photography, and videography. While I was there I heard many small children screaming, (while this is normal, it is also very dark in the exhibits.)Other highlights:They host several feedings daily, They have a very large (open sea) tank.Here's a set of mine on flickr (pictures)Check it out =] (flickr.com/photos/bornem…"
2616,2014-03-17,2,"The word overrated comes to mind.  It's a nice Aquarium but they have no business charging anyone $40.00 per ticket (ahem, excuse me $39.95).  It's smaller than you think it would be, crowded to the point where you can't see half of the exhibits, and I didn't see anything that seemed more amazing or spectacular than what the Steinhart Aquarium at the Academy of Science in San Francisco offers (which by the way charges less for admission at $29.95). Unless you're already going to be in the area (as we were) don't make a special trip.  A lot of comments have centered around how great it is for kids, but honestly I can't imagine how little ones would be able to see much of anything with the large crowds unless you put them up on your shoulders.  Maybe try going midweek to avoid the crowds."
2617,2014-06-04,5,Best experience specially for the kids!! Went to see the cuttlefishes and jellyfishes show. Great displays of animals. Will come back again for sure
2618,2015-05-16,2,When did this place get way over priced? I had a nice time but its not Disneyland so the admission prices need to come down before I go again. Also there should be a limit to how many people can be let in. Was way to crowded when I went.
2619,2012-05-19,5,I love coming here!  My father-in-law is a member of the aquarium so he always knows when the exhibits are opening and he always tells me when to visit.  I especially enjoy coming early before the crowds and getting a chance to speak with the staff at the big tank exhibit where I can watch a scuba diver explain about various sea life.  This is such a great place to bring kids with all the sensory activities that will keep kids attention for hours!
2620,2007-07-18,4,"Not bad.  I had really high expectations so I was a little disappointed.As a kid, I imagine this place must look HUMUNGOUS!  The place is still pretty big because.... apparently I missed the entire penguin exhibit and didn't even know until a couple days later when my friend asked if I saw the penguins.  My response: ""What penguins? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!""It was really windy that day so walking around outside sucks!Students get a couple bucks off admission so bring your ID card.**UPDATED 1/20/08: Went here again today.  There were a lot less tuna than the last time and the employee said that it's because they die when they get old and they had to move some since you can't have so many 500 lb. tuna swimming around in one tank.  I also heard that the penguin exhibit will be there in March 2008.  I want to see those finally!"
2621,2009-11-30,5,"I love aquariums! I've been to ones in San Diego, Long Beach, and San Francisco and I think this one is the best one in California. It's so clean, educational, and laid out very well.Also, Monterey is a fun day trip location. Living in San Jose, it's not too far of a drive for me and definitely good for a day trip. However, this place is a great destination for a weekend as there are beautiful hotels in Monterey and some fun shopping in both Monterey and nearby Carmel. The aquarium is also reasonably priced and is hours of fun."
2622,2012-08-29,5,"A great aquarium!Good looking exhibits and lots of interesting fish. Great views of Monterey Bay from the rear deck; you can try to look for seals and otters using the telescopes outside. Quite a few interactive exhibits: various touch tanks, bat ray petting pool, barnacle feeding, tide changing, etc.It can get a bit crowded, especially on a summer weekend, so I recommend coming during the week during the school year for a more comfortable excursion. If not you should be prepared for kids and an photographers cutting you off to get to the front of some of the tanks. The feedings can get a bit crowded but the open sea and kelp tank feedings shouldn't be missed.Everyone loves the mola mola (a plush is available in the gift shop) but I loved the sardines school the most."
2623,2008-02-16,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium saved me from drowning.  [Read: I have been drowning in work and in my very own self-absorbed life in the big city and I have been ready to be rescued for quite some time now... ]I came to MBA for the first time and immediately felt it's warm waters of therapy wash over me.Who knew watching jellyfish slither and pulsate about could be so relaxing?  Who ever thought that observing schools of fish darting back and forth could provide such clarity and peace of mind?  Okay, sure if you come to the aquarium by yourself on the Friday of a bank holiday weekend, you'll likely have to deal with watching cutesy young couples whisper and hold hands and you will most certainly encounter hoards of families toting toddlers and pushing strollers.  You may even bump into a class of elementary school students on a field trip.  But you know what?  It's worth it all.  Seeing these exibits, talking to the friendly volunteers, attending the educational films, it's all so very worth it."
2624,2009-09-18,5,"One of my favorite places in CA, no in the U.S.This was my first Aquarium experience in my life. Can you believe this? In my life? lol I used to say ""Why do you wanna see fishes?"" But this experience blew the idea away. The best sea creature I love now is 'Seahorses.' There was a  Seahorse exhibition, and I saw a lot kinds of them. Some looked like just seaweed, and some looked very beautiful. They were just amazing. Have you ever seen a seahorse blinking? Those tiny eyes blinked and I was just mesmerized. And it was such a shock that male seahorses get pregnant. lolThis place is very nice for kids. There are areas where kids can actually touch those sea creatures and learn from staffs. Very educational, right?I will come back here as soon as I come to San Francisco."
2625,2015-05-05,4,Extremely busy aquarium.  I really enjoyed the stingray attraction and the huge kelp forest display.  I would recommend a people mover cause it is a long hike all over this place.  The sea otters are a nice big hit.  The parking is a nightmare.
2626,2015-01-12,3,"This place is cool nice place to take kids but OVERPRICED $40 for an adult ticket is just crazy & $25 for a kids, they need to add more for those prices. The overall expierence is nice but definetly change the cost."
2627,2012-04-16,5,"Growing up in the Monterey area the Aquarium has been one of my favorite places to visit since I was a kid.On a recent trip home to visit I stopped by the aquarium to check out the new Jelly Fish exhibit. The exhibit was beautiful, lots and lots of pretty jelly fish from all over the world. While I was there my friend who works at the aquarium told me to stop by the bat ray tank for a feeding. I stopped by and little did I know that I was going to get to feed a bat ray myself! I was handed a squid and given instructions on how to feed them, and this huge bat ray swam right over to me and sucked the squid right out of my hand! It was one of the coolest experiences I've had at the aquarium!"
2628,2011-10-10,5,"Informative.  Breathe-taking.  Educational.  Full of children.I love sea-life, and have been to several aquariums in my day, but this one has gotta take the cake.  All the sea-life here is from the local waters, and they pump local waters into the aquarium- quite a nice set up.  The most notable thing I saw here is the kelp forrest.  Un-be-lievable.  This is worth the trip alone.Also, the volunteers here are wonderful.  Don't rush through the aquarium, take time to talk to the volunteers, they will drop knowledge on you.  I was also a huge fan of the installation about the history of the sardine industry in the area.  Don't skip it if you are into history!The only downside of the aquarium for me was the amount of children.  I came here on a weekday, thinking it would be empty.  Boy was I wrong.  It didn't occur to me that kids were on summer vacation and the aquarium was chock full of summer camp kids on field trips.  If being in a mob of screaming children is as tiresome for you as it is for me, please be weary of this.  Otherwise, phenomenal establishment."
2629,2012-03-16,3,"Good exhibits, but nothing compares to the aquarium in Dallas. Went for the otters and they were not doing much. A little pricey compared to some other nationally known aquariums.Petting pools had a few sick or dead fish in them. Gross!Volunteers were knowledgable. We actually spent a while talking to a gentleman in the aviary about some of the birds, which turned out to be rather interesting."
2630,2012-05-02,4,"I was so excited to be at the Monterey Bay Aquarium because I remembered coming here and having such a great time, but this time it was okay. I came on Easter and that was a bad idea! It was so crowded that I could not see anything in the tanks and the tanks are gigantic! So many people crowding around the tanks that it was impossible to see anything up close, so my fiance and I just stood in the back, took a quick look and went onto the next exhibit. This happened to all the exhibits we came across. I was looking forward to the sea otters and boy, that was not fun trying to find a spot to look at them. The place itself is gorgeous and very clean. There is a lot for kids to do here like seeing the feedings and hands on activities they have out while walking through exhibits especially in the jellyfish experience exhibit. The only thing I liked about Monterey Bay Aquarium is being outside on the patio and just look out into the bay. Most of the exhibits are in the dark so keep an eye on your kids and yourself! My fiance had to stay behind me cause this man kept following me very closely from behind.There are parking structures on different streets. I enjoyed the walk from the parking structure to the aquarium. The tickets were $32 for adults I think. Considering my fiance and I went on a holiday, we finished the whole aquarium in 30 minutes, so the price of the tickets weren't worth it for us. I'm giving Monterey Bay Aquarium 4 starts even though it was a okay experience for me. For what I have seen, you will have more fun if 1. you're a kid and 2. if you have kids. This is a good place for family trip."
2631,2012-03-14,5,"Hands down best aquarium I've ever been to.  Keep in mind, this is coming from a Chinese girl who grew up going to museums, zoos and aquariums for our family vacations because they were fun AND educational.  As previous reviews have mentioned, make sure to check the map/schedule sheet they hand you when you enter.  Feeding times differ each day.  Make sure to get the text alerts for additional feeding times.  While we were there, they also texted us about otters spotted just outside in the bay!  They do open their doors a few minutes early so you can wait in the lobby.  There were volunteers/staff in the lobby with jellyfish in tubes to keep us entertained while waiting.Yes, the tickets are pricy but we were able to buy tickets ahead of time at our hotel (which also helps you avoid the LONG ticket lines at the door) which are good for 2 days for the same price.Bottom line:  Awesome aquarium, great for kids and adults!"
2632,2011-11-07,2,"I'm rating this a 2.5.If you could see my face right now, it would read disappointment. I want my 30 bucks back. I was very excited to go here, with all the wonderful reviews I was hearing and what not. Well, the only thing my boyfriend and I enjoyed were the jelly fish. The Aquarium itself is nice, don't get me wrong. It's clean, well kept, and inviting.The marine life is pretty, but their exhibits left me yawning. Not to mention it was jam-packed. I also don't do well with hidden political agendas, such as their ""Co2"" section. Parking is horrible. I can't remember if they have garage parking or not, but if they do, we must of passed due to price. This is worth $15 not $30."
2633,2010-01-17,5,"1st our tips & tricks. Buy a membership, attend at the margins: early openings, late afternoons, member's nights. If something feels crowded walk away; be ready for experiences you don't expect!Today's highlights:- Sparkle, my daughter's new friend - a fish in the kelp tank that waved at her. - the glittering silver spheroids that are schools of little fish (anchovies?) sparkling in the sun!- the shore birds in the aviary, in arms reach, oblivious as they go about their existence. - looking over the edge into the real Monterey Bay and seeing a wild sea otter so close as it ravaged a crab for brunch. - the Irish Wolfhound club as they walked 30 (yes 30!) Of the largest dogs I've ever seen onto the pier between the wings of the museum. - returning in the evening and watching my girl for 90 minutes touching and trying to touch the tantalizingly near Bat Rays. One came to the surface and flapped it's wings - splashing us, soaking us - and my girl's response was to laugh and splash back!"
2634,2015-04-25,5,"I signed up to review this :D This is one of its kind experience, wonderful place. I always wanted to see something like this since I was a kid and it more than fulfilled my wish, it gives you the feeling of seeing this magnificent creatures in their homes being in a submarine. Simply loved it, wish could spent more time here."
2635,2010-08-14,4,Love here!  My fave is the penguins and sea otters.  Sea otters are the cutest things!  They amuse me and make me giggle like a child at a candy store with their antics.A sea otter went on the dry land and started rolling around like a ball!  Haha...how's that for the wild!  They were also fluffing their fur to look good for their feeding time.  Great place to go to with family!  Keep in mind there are lots of children...yelling and screaming.  I was a big kid here too!
2636,2017-04-08,1,"I had not been here in awhile so we decided to take our son for his birthday, total mistake the entry price is so high for what you get it was. It was so crowded the tourist are so rude the staff was not helpful at all we couldn't hardly get close even with all the people to see anything there's a lot of stuff that's just big televisions playing an aquarium scene(can watch that at home) everything looked worn out and dirty even looking in the large aquariums like the one with the hammer head shark the water looked cloudy and the big school of fish circling on the middle really took away from everything how many tanks and those fish going in circles do you need there's at least four of them just in different sized tanks. We felt so rushed with the people pushing you through and not being able to let the kids enjoy any of the stuff for kids because some parents don't understand the concept of okay let's give the other kids a chance to play or see therefore we paid $160 to get in $15 to park and ended up leaving in about an hour and a half. I felt like this place had really went down. Maybe they see that tourist just pay the money regardless so no need to keep up on it. As for my family most likely won't be back I feel like my sons birthday trip was a complete failure after being so excited to go."
2637,2012-10-17,5,"Awesome place to visit! Fish, Jellies, Seahorses, spectacular views of the bay and extremely kid friendly! Had a great time. A lil pricey but definitely worth the money!Will be back in the near future."
2638,2011-10-31,5,"Such a beautiful aquarium - great for both adults and children. Highlights: All of the exhibits, touch pools, and tanks. It's mesmerizing watching the jellyfish and fish swim, and the ambiance is really special. The Secret Life of Seahorses exhibit was cute, and there are lots of other animals to see - penguins, puffins, sea otters, stingrays, etc.  It's fun watching the little kids flip out with excitement. You should budget 2-3 hours depending on interest. There's a cafe and plenty of restrooms. The location on Cannery Row is really convenient. We found $10 all day parking on Wave St, which was way more affordable than other parking areas."
2639,2016-09-25,5,This is an amazing place- it's expensive but worth it. Don't forget to go downstairs as there are great hidden places and sometimes you can get stuck upstairs with all the amazing exhibits upstairs.... time doesn't allow for the entire museum so if you can... go for two days. Many hotels offer two day passes for the price of one.. make sure to check before buying your tickets!! (this also avoids waiting on big line because you have advanced purchased tickets!!)
2640,2012-01-28,5,"Because I am a sea animal buff, I've been to many different aquariums/marine parks. This one is my favorite of all, hands down.I won't repeat what other reviews have said, but I will say, try not to go on a weekend or holiday if possible. I have seen white sharks on display here twice. Nothing compares! Also, I know it is expensive, but keep in mind the money goes towards conservation efforts and the animals- if that makes you feel better about it."
2641,2012-02-26,2,"It's an alright aquarium, but way too crowded.  Came here on a Saturday and expected it to be busy, but from 12 noon to closing at 5 there was no way to get up close to a single exhibit, except for the virtual ones.Staff is not very friendly.  Asked one of the information ladies if there was a room with water on all sides.  She responded, ""no, you're wrong.""Little kids are running around all over the place."
2642,2015-05-30,5,Must see this place! Excellent but park at the day lot down the street. The City lot is 20 bucks!
2643,2015-02-15,1,The fact that they close super early is a big thumbs down! Drove from Sacramento all the way down there. I expected to see a way bigger aquarium. Not that attracting from the outside at all. There was tons of traffic. Not allowing to give us enough time to visit everything.
2644,2014-11-18,5,Love. . Love. . Love it here.  I take my family every year.  Very clean.  Friendly staff.  Parking is close by and affordable.  $7 per day. My kids love learning new things about the ocean around us and the amazing rescues of the animals done by the staff.
2645,2012-09-09,5,"I went to the aquarium a couple of times when I was little and loved it.  When Adam and I went this week I still loved it.  Our favorite exhibits were the jellies and the seahorses, but every exhibit is worth visiting.  The only disappointment was that they are working on the otter exhibit so it was closed.We arrived before 10 AM on a Wednesday morning and got to use the members' entrance.  We basically had the exhibits to ourselves for the first hour, so I recommend that if you are going to go, go before they start!"
2646,2012-05-28,4,"Amazing aquarium, but try to avoid the holiday weekend - they really know how to pack you in like a sardine (sustainably caught of course)!  Plenty of exhibits to keep you busy all day.  Full of jellies, seahorses, pipefish, sea dragons and more!  The baby shark in its cocoon was super cool.  Don't look at the price, just pay it!"
2647,2011-12-05,5,"Sea otters, penguins and funny sea dragons...Sting rays and dolphins and starfish and urchins...Colorful fish and some sharks with sharp teeth...Those are a few of my favorite things.... and they're all at the Monterey Aquarium!  Amazing.  Throw in some sea turtles and bathrooms all around, and I'm set for a day of fun."
2648,2012-05-02,5,"I have been coming to this Aquarium for 25 years and it just gets better!  Our family and a friend drove from San Francisco on a Sat.  We arrived at the covered parking garage by 10:30 AM and it was wide open tons of spaces.  No line at the entrance (we had been given five tickets, score!).  The oldest member of our party is 57 ( sorry Bob) the youngest my daughter is 9.  Everyone had a great time, favorites were the otters, penguins (the display seemed small), splash tanks, jellies, sea horses and open ocean tank.  After being to Sea Life Center in Seward Alaska I was disappointed in the sea bird display.We used the divide and conquer strategy and saw the whole thing.  We enjoyed the food at the Cafe and can recommend the pizzas, deli sandwiches and hamburgers.The gift store was OK, but considering the Aquariums commitment to the environment we had a hard time finding gifts that were not made in China.  China has a terrible record on protecting the environment and it's factory workers, and then there is the expense ( in oil ) of shipping everything across the Pacific Ocean...  The staff was very helpful in directing us to the few products made locally or in the USA."
2649,2012-02-27,5,"I love aquariums and love local marine life especially since I am a Marine Biology major. Being a Los Angeles resident, I've been to our local Aquarium of the Pacific (Long Beach) countless times, and to other smaller aquariums (Cabrillo, etc). However, I have to say, Monterey Bay Aquarium is the most epic aquarium I have had the pleasure to check out.The first time I came here was when they had a young Great White Shark on exhibit several summers ago - 2007 I think? I've always wanted to see one in person and I was finally able to when I came here. A few years later I decided to take another road trip up the coast and visit the aquarium again. Admission isn't too bad at $35, especially with all the things you see. First of all, try to get here early. The place gets mad crowded later on, and to get the best experience, I have two protips:1) Get the daily schedule which includes feeding tmes. Try to plan your way around the aquarium according to that schedule. It's pretty amazing watching them feed the animals.2) They tell you to text a number to get text reminders for feeding times for the animals that don't have scheduled feedings. Get that. They texted us when they were feeding the sea otters which was a pretty funny and entertaining presentation.The Open water exhibit is probably my favorite. Dolphinfish, Yellowtail Tuna, Sunfish, Hammerheads, Sea Turtles and 16,000 (yes, 16,000) Sardines swimming in a massive million gallon tank. The room that this exhibit is in gets pretty crowded; if you can, try to make it to the very front as 1/3 of the tank is below the viewing window, and the sardines tend to hang out at the bottom.Most of the other exhibits showcase local flora and fauna, common fish and invertebrates that you see along the California Coast and in Monterey Bay. Leopard Sharks, Rockfishes, Whitefish, etc. Lots of Jellyfish. Rays. Crabs. Lobsters. Oh, and kelp. They also have a few tropical fish displays. Not much as far as freshwater fish though, but no biggie.As far as parking goes, I parked at the all-day parking lot between Foam, Reeside, and Cannery Row. $10 all day. There's closer parking for the same price but this lot is central to the Aquarium and the Wharf.This place is a must-see for all animal/fish/ocean lovers. Totally amazing place.**By the way, be on a lookout outside the aquarium or anywhere along Cannery Row for wild Sea Otters playing on the water!"
2650,2014-12-25,5,"Please go. I've been going all my life, my family has for 28 years. It sparks my curiosity with marine biology. There is no better place in the world other than this."
2651,2016-09-22,1,"I really wanted to be impressed - but I wasn't. First off, for $50 per person admission fee, I expected (hoped) to see far more exhibits than were there. It is a beautiful building - but the number and quality of exhibits are severly lacking. Quite simply, this aquarium cannot compete with Chicago's Shedd or the National Aquarium in Baltimore, but is twice the orice of Shedd and 20% more than the National Aquarium in Baltimore. There are lots of ways for you to spend money here though. I do not care to pay $50 to be resold again and again. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this aquarium. Perhaps Monterey Bay Aquarium should invest in more displays and education instead of shops, cafeterias and kids stores. It has become an overpriced tourist trap on Cannery Row and simply not up to the standards of other options - but just not in this area."
2652,2014-04-30,5,"Awesome experience for the family , my daughters favorite subject right now is about marine life and this was amazing for her . All employees are helpful. Amazing full room views of underwater sealift amazing."
2653,2014-09-04,1,"I didn't enjoy this aquarium. On my visit, there really wasn't any room to see the animals because there were so many people, and I get it everyone wants to see but I've seen better layouts where there is plenty of room for everyone to see. Another note it was not easy to navigate and we couldn't find many animals, but that's just me."
2654,2016-10-11,5,I visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium just last month and love the fact that they regularly rotate their exhibits. Please bring back the Sea Horse exhibit.
2655,2011-11-13,5,"Wow.  WOW!  Took some good friends from out of state for a short whirlwind tour of Monterey, which included the aquarium.  This was a 2 day visit we turned into 6 hours.  Really.  If you want to really SEE all that's available at the aquarium, you really should take 2 days.  We never did get to see the 30 minute viewings, though I sure wanted to.  Our favorites were the jellies, the seahorses, the otters and the very cool feeding times that were always narrated by one of the staff.  In the kelp forest, we watched the diver get into the tank with the fish and hand feed them!  Plus the day we went was home-school day so there were a ton of kiddos there all oooing and ahhhing at the sights and sounds, which made everything seem just a little more magical seeing it all through their eyes.They also do a great job of educating folks about the best ways you can support the aquarium and sea-life in general in your everyday lives.  But definitely, I'm not kidding.  Wear GOOD, comfortable walking shoes and if you have issues with standing, be prepared to take breaks.  If you have mobility issues, consider not going on days when there's a ton of kids, though I suspect that's all the time.  So call ahead!Also, be sure to sign up for the text messages that alert you to the various feeding times through out the day.  There's a great cafeteria too - super pricey but we hope the proceeds were going to the aquarium.  It's not clear if that's the case.  There's a knickknack store there are well with all manner of goodies, though I think you could get a lot of things for less in the various stores along cannery row.A great time had by all!  But we sure were ready to chill out back in the hotel after the day was done.  5 stars for totally excellent experience!"
2656,2014-07-28,4,The location of this aquarium is awesome. It's rightThe sea otters are a must see! Especially during feeding time.
2657,2014-07-28,5,"I LOVE THIS AQUARIUM! One of the best! It's located on Cannery Row, which is beautiful, historic, and host to many shops and restaurants. The views are amazing!  There's tons of exhibits, you'll never get bored. My favorite is the current Jelly Fish one that's ""groovy"" and has cool 60's music and light shows. Very psychedelic. I went on a saturday in july, it was busy as expected. But I'm sure on a week day it would be less crazy. Defnitely worth coming by if you're in the bay are."
2658,2014-11-06,5,"Best aquarium! Educational and beautiful. $40 entrance fee seems steep at first, but trust me it is worth every penny. You'll be there at least 2 hours. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Can't recommend this place enough!"
2659,2011-07-18,5,"So I came all the way here from Vallejo and it was totally worth the drive. I didn't know very much about this place, except that it was just an aquarium. Let me tell you, it's not JUST any ordinary aquarium! There was so much to do, so much to see, I was completely entertained and intrigued everywhere I went here. It was amazing seeing the huge schools of fish swim around you as well as the mysterious jellyfish floating about. It was even entertaining watching the standstill ""rock"" fishes that just surprisingly stayed floating in one position the entire time. How do they do that?! The scuba diver cleaning the tanks was hilarious (see my photo of his missing finger). I completely adored the penguins! The list goes on and on! So stop reading this review and go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium!! I guarantee you'll love it just as much as I did (if not more!)"
2660,2012-03-04,3,"I really like coming here. It's a little pricey at $33 per person. We bought a 16 oz drink inside for $4.02, so you may want to bring your own!It was extremely crowded this time because we went on a weekend. I would recommend going during the week when there are less people. We got to see the feeding at the Open Sea exhibit. It was really interesting, but really crowded. (And there was a man standing behind me who smelled really bad). I was a little disappointed because we didn't get to see the sharks eat. We will come back again, but not for a while and next time during the week."
2661,2012-07-26,4,"I've been to the Long Beach Aquarium and million times and I've always wanted to come here.  My bf and I were on a road trip and of course had to stop by.  This place is huge!  It took us about 3 hours to walk through the whole aquarium.  We both loved the jelly experience, super cool.  The only think we didn't like was there was only one tropical tank :(  buuut I definitely recommend coming here!  Parking is expensive, I think it was like $20 so we found a spot on the street in a metered spot."
2662,2014-06-23,5,The aquarium has a clean and modern design with great spaces for humans and animals alike. The staff are helpful without being too pushy. Regular feedings make the experience much more dynamic - seeing a 400 lb tuna travel 40 mph to chomp on its prey was amazing.
2663,2014-08-26,5,"Lots of fun! Knowledgable staff, clean, lots of different animals to see. Cafe is a little too expensive. It was my 1st time here and I loved it! I'd definitely like to go back sometime!"
2664,2015-04-04,5,A must if in Monterey!  Went on a Friday and it was perfect..not crowded at all...exhibits are amazing.  Parking close by is $10 but no in & out privledges but no biggie!
2665,2012-07-23,5,"AMAZING. A few girlfriends and I wanted to take a trip to Monterey and the main focal point of our trip was to go to the aquarium!  Absolutely the best aquarium I have ever been to. The place is massive and there is something to see any which way you turn!  My fave section of the aquarium was ofcourse the jellyfish.  I am not sure what my obsession is about these creatures but somehow it is so calming to watch them move. I could stare at these things for days and I would be entertained.  Monterey Aquarium has so many different types of jellies it is insane. They're so pretty!  The Jellyfish Experience on the bottom floor was 5 stars. Loved! It was very 70s retro themed. very different but also neat! Next door to the jellies was the sea horse exhibit! Also! very cool! The architecture of the place is very innovative, there are areas where you can go outside onto a balcony and grab some fresh air and look down onto some seals!  We sat thru the Great White Shark info /movie clip and the woman narrating the show was so energetic. It is so refreshing to listen to someone that is excited about their job and just wants to share her knowledge. She was perfect for all ages and she kept everyone's attention. And! I even learned a few fun facts!  The only thing that may have been a bit annoying was the areas to touch the live creatures.. i didnt get to touch anything bc everyone was being a hover-craft and there wasnt any sign of a line or anyone moving for that matter. It would be nice to have it run like an assembly line so everyone can get a chance to pet something.  =)  I wasnt too bummed though bc afterall A. it is geared more for kids, and B. i dont like sea water smell on my hands. haha! win win i guess. Yes, this aquarium is a tad expensive but what aquarium isn't? And! If you look at all of the architecture and how cool everything is laid out you will understand. And! This aquarium is massive! hello! Some of our ticket/giftstore money goes towards the upkeep of this place so I am a supporter!  I wish it wasnt so far away otherwise I would totes become a member! I will definately come back!"
2666,2017-09-15,4,"Large and impressive aquarium. Many helpful employees and volunteers. Good map. Quite expensive, but worth it to some. Some species (otters and birds) are all rescues that cannot be returned to the wild, but not all. I appreciated the temporary exhibits on Baja California/Gulf of California species, but the entire aquarium was excellent. There were many pieces of art throughout the aquarium in multiple exhibits, which really enhanced the experience. There was a greater emphasis on conservation than I have seen at other aquariums I can remember, but I am rating four instead of five stars because of the claims about ""sustainable seafood."" There is no sustainable seafood, and the suggestions made in the exhibits and pamphlets was impractical. One species in particular was a type of squid, and the exhibit said, I paraphrase: we don't know much about this species or its numbers past or present, so that's why we think it's a ""good alternative"" to eat and not a ""best choice."" We don't know how the populations are doing, so we say just eat them? Makes no sense. This aquarium welcomes visitors from all over the world, not to mention the entire U.S. They have the platform to be bold and encourage impactful change, but instead choose to send the lukewarm conservation message of: you don't have to give anything up/make any sacrifices, but if you donate/""are more thoughtful""/write your representatives, then you can make a difference. At this point, I suppose I shall step down from my soapbox. This is a wonderful place to visit, but they can still improve!"
2667,2015-04-01,5,We got a membership to the aquarium for a year and went every time we had family or friends visit us. It is a wonderful place to learn about the local wildlife and conservation efforts of our ocean. There was a play place for kids to touch and feel and volunteers that tell you about all of the different aspects of the area. It's great.
2668,2012-07-16,5,"This is the best aquarium I've ever been to! My husband, me, and my sons came here last week and we were definitely not disappointed. We enjoyed the various exhibits they had. One of my favorites were the jellyfish and my son liked looking at the penguins. They had various play areas for children which was great because my 1 year old was able to run around and play for a bit. The prices are a bit expensive. My husband is in the military so we were able to get our tickets on base ($31 for adults, still a bit steep). However, caring for the animals, research, and conservation efforts do cost money! We will definitely come back here again when our boys are a bit older."
2669,2011-08-10,5,"i LOVEEE this aquarium! I came here when i was a little kid and totally doesnt remember it until my mom told me when she saw my picture in front of the whale hanging on on the ceiling. I've visited this place twice again since i was a kid and really enjoyed my time here. I was visiting my boyfriend in Monterey and while he was in school, i visited the aquarium myself. It was PACKED on a tuesday, There were a bunch of tourist! I still had a great time looking at all the different exhibits at my own pace. I did wish i was less crowded so i can take some better pictures.They change up the exhibits from time to time so it keeps things fresh. The Jelly fish exhibits is a LOT smaller than the last time i visited. They had a whole room dedicated just for the jelly fishes. i LOOVEEEE the penguins! They have a 1 million gallon tank that is basically 3 levels high. it's amazing to see all different types of fishes swimming together. This is a really good place to visit with family and kids, they have a petting area where the kids can touch starfish, sting rays, and large kelp. Very educational yet fun. I will for sure come back and visit again in a few years."
2670,2014-03-10,5,"What an amazing nod to marine diversity and preservation.  This was the main event of my birthday weekend spent in Monterey.  I had gone years ago as a kid with my parents but didn't really appreciate the quality of this aquarium until now.  My bf and I had such a great time walking around the exhibits that I even enjoyed the screaming children and their delight in the many species of sea creatures on display.  The Pisces in me was thrilled!  I've even found myself on their website multiple times since our trip and will definitely be back for their new ""tentacles"" exhibit when it opens."
2671,2007-08-21,5,"I haven't been there recently (maybe six months ago), but I would say if you are in the area or live anywhere within 100 miles it's worth the trip to see this aquarium. Price is about on a par with other attractions (read, more than a movie, less than a concert), but what you get is way beyond what you might expect. I might say all they have they owe to otters, but I wouldn't say such a corny thing! The sea otters are a lot of fun to watch, though. All the fish are interesting, as well as the kelp and anemones and other sea life. But the most fascinating things they have are the jellyfish exhibits. I've never seen such beautiful and etherial creatures.I plan to go again soon, and its almost 150-mile round trip for me. Young or old (I'm old) you'll find something to fascinate and amaze you in this place."
2672,2015-03-21,3,"This was a good way to spend a few hours in Monterey. How can you not love the jelly fish? That said, in comparison to other aquariums, either Boston's or Toronto's are bigger and better."
2673,2009-10-30,4,The Aquarium doesn't really need my measly little review to add to its 600+ reviews but here it is.Go for the Sea Otters and the various Jelly Fish.Pet some slimy things and some weird things at the two different touch counters.Hand Sanitizer is good since there are usually lots of snotty little kids screeching and running around.And if anyone can tell me how to coax a giant octopus into my purse help a sista' out.
2674,2008-05-30,5,"OTTERS! They're so cute.Props to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for really rounding out the visitor experience. Not only can you poke sea cucumbers and stroke bat rays, but now true otter enthusiasts can flip open the lid of a box in the ""Wild About Otters"" exhibit to relish in the pungent aroma of Asian small-clawed otter spraint. What's spraint? It's another word biologists use for poop. That's right."
2675,2012-07-07,4,"I'm sad. This place used to be so awesome, and you can check out all the awesomeness for about $25. But now, it's $35 for an adult admission. I'd been coming here once every two years and it's pretty much the same every time. The aquarium is definitely one of the largest, and you can pretty much check out everything in 1 1/2 hour. Definitely check out these exhibits though:-JELLYFISH: memerizing, I can stare at them all day-SEA OTTER: cute-PENGUINS: make me want one for a pet, so cute!-SEA TURTLES, SHARKS & TUNAS at Open Sea: wow, make me think about how amazing our ocean is.Oh yes, bring your student ID if you have one to save $3 on admission."
2676,2011-09-09,2,"I was disappointed that the aquarium was overbearingly made for children.  I did not mind the kids at all; and in fact was not bothered when they crawled on me as I had to kneel down on my knees to lower myself to the exhibits.  I understand that parents need to be given a break and in some cases a hand, it's a hard job.Unfortunately,  whoever designed the aquarium predominantly designed for one end of the spectrum of different types of people.  There was virtually no mental stimulation for adults.  I did not come away having learned anything new.  I suppose if I had bought one of the books in one of the three gift shops I could have gleamed some insight as to the different habitats I was looking at. Instead the exhibits offered kitsch, politically fueled scenes.   For example a fake man posed inside of a boardwalk, fortune teller-like game holding a tree in one hand and a mushroom cloud from a nuclear bomb in the other.  He was moving his hands up and down as if to weigh them.  Another exhibit featured a cow and it's feces, of course the little kiddies did not understand this huge life-sized horror story about Co2, but instead played with the faux-feces, classy!  While I am so glad this place exists and the staff is doing their important research- go to the Academy of Science if you're interested in learning."
2677,2015-03-16,4,"I would give it it 5 stars but the price for admission is too much.  Nothing but good things to say about the  aquarium itself.  Beautiful, interesting, and well maintained.  The cost for adults is $40 each and kid tickets are $25 each.  We were there for an hour and a half...seems pretty steep to me."
2678,2015-03-15,5,"I really love this place. We ended up getting a season pass. The place is clean and my kids love it. After our third visit this year, this place is still amazing. The cafeteria has excellent food also."
2679,2015-03-13,5,This is my All-time favorite Aquarium!My boyfriend and I drove to Monterey Bay all the way from North Hollywood for it and it was totally worth the very long drive! I absolutely LOVED the Jellyfish Exhibit! I fell in love with it. They had so many cool organisms and it was very educating. I wish I could go back!Their cafeteria is also very good as well! They have an AMAZING vegetarian burger and do not cheat you out of french fries. The admission is pricy compared to other aquariums but it was  worth it.  If I lived closer I would have definitely gotten a membership.
2680,2012-09-07,5,Huge!  I felt like a little kid checking out all the exhibits and running around taking pictures.  It was romantic going with my boyfriend.  Parking was easy to find on a Friday afternoon.
2681,2014-07-02,3,"I was super excited to come to the aquarium, regardless of the high price. I came on a Saturday morning, which I realize now, was a mistake. The crowds were huge. I could barely see and felt rushed. Some of the exhibits were cool to look at, however, I was far from blown away. It would be nice to come visit again on the weekday, but I don't feel too compelled to return anytime soon. It's a great place to take kids if you're planning on exploring Monterey as well. I must say, I was a little disappointed, but it's worth coming to see once."
2682,2009-02-22,5,"I've been here numerous times in my life and each time it's even more eye opening than the previous turn.  A vast array of sea and beach life guaranteed to make you go whoooa.  Sharks, fish, octopii, squids, birds, the whole nine yards.  From what I've read, they no longer have the Great White there, is that correct?  If so, that's quite a bummer.  I remember seeing that thing as a kid and being amazed.  While you're there, also be sure to check out the historical exhibit they have on the city of Monterey itself.  Very fascinating stuff.If you're visiting California or just going on a vacation, consider passing through Monterey.  You won't regret it.  In a way it's like a mini San Francisco; beautiful city right by the bay."
2683,2013-11-26,5,"Have been to many aquariums and have to say that MBA is the best.  A tad expensive but definitely worth the money the Monterey Bay Aquarium has something for the whole family.  The only warning I would give is bring your own lunch.  The  cafe is incredibly expensive and honestly not that great.  $42 for two soups, one salad, fruit cup and two soda's."
2684,2011-10-24,4,"Get here early because the parking lots fills up quick and fast. For public parking, follow the P sign.Public Parking: $15Private Parking in a Hotel Parking structure on Cannery Row: $20This aquarium is just fantastic. We spent the whole afternoon exploring it. There are multiple shows with animals and in small theaters.My absolute favorites and my must see recommendations are:1. jellyfishes2. the huge ocean sunfish 3. seahorsesTIPS:-Go to the Information Desk for a map-Watch the penguin feeding show-Watch the otter feeding show-Watch the 15min movies they have scheduledWhether an adult or a child, it's truly a great place to learn about our beautiful ocean and its inhabitants."
2685,2012-06-26,3,"My boyfriend and I decided to take a day trip to Monterey this past weekend. We started our adventure with a stop at the aquarium. My boyfriend loves penguins and this is one of the few places we know where you can see them.We had a blast going through the aquarium and playing the games they have. We also loved seeing the penguins and sea otters. Both animals were very cute and playful.Overall we had a fun time here, the aquarium is a good place to check out once every few years. The last time we both were here was back in high school."
2686,2013-12-12,3,"I'm going to upgrade my review to 3 stars.  I went in on the free day for Monterey residents.  The aquarium is spacious and well maintained.  The sealife and animal exhibits were all wonderful.  Especially the otters and penguins.  However the social messages I could do with out.  The world is ending, don't eat wild fish, etc.  I'll do what I want with or without with your approval Monterey Aquarium.  But for a free day not bad.  I would not pay the $39 regular admission to get in though!"
2687,2012-01-04,5,"I love nature, wild animals, seeing them in their natural habitat. Aquariums are less than natural, but its as close as I can get without  diving in the ocean. I had so much fun here! The octopus was swimming around and that excited me - they usually just sit up against the glass! There are some beautiful exhibits here. The way they've built some of their tanks, and how the fish make it comfortable for them. It all comes together as a beautiful display. I think I like this aquarium better than the aquarium of the pacific which is in Long Beach, CA. Its huge, inside and out, three stories.I only wish they had Whale sharks. I have to visit the Atlanta aquarium for that. :-)Parking does suck though. I'm still confused on how that went. But my best friend found a legitimate park so that was cool. We had to walk down a small hill (Not  too abnormal considering we were in nearing SF), but that may be inconvenient to someone whose using a walker, crutches, or has limited mobility. Where was handicap parking? I don't know. I may have researched it if we needed it, but we didn't. Those who do, be wary though. Make sure you get your spot, assuming they're available.The place is still awesome, and totally worth the difficult parking trek! =)"
2688,2013-08-15,5,Pretty awesome! Loooooove when they have lots of otters to look at!!! Great for kids 1 year -100
2689,2015-03-01,5,I came up from Los Angeles . It was totally worth it. I will totally return again. The place was amazing.
2690,2011-07-20,4,"Everything is excellent about this aquarium as an aquarium. The place was clean, nice, many things can be learned here, awesome marine life, very helpful staff, etc. Nothing wrong at all with the aquarium.My only complaint is the parking. I literally drove for about a half hour to find a lot that wasn't empty, and when I get there I find out that I'm not allowed to ""turn around and exit the parking lot without paying."" Fine, WHATEVER noobTUBE! I'll pay the $20 all day parking even though I'm only going to be here for 2 hours. So lame. #scrooged"
2691,2014-08-24,5,"Totally worth the $40- lots of different exhibits, areas, shows, feedings and discussions. We learned a lot with the 15 minute discussions at the auditorium and it was fun petting the stingrays and watching for otters in the ocean. The otter feeding was fun too. The jellyfish were really awesome, I'm glad they had a whole extra exhibit. Good cafe/restaurant but the gift shop was pretty lame"
2692,2014-11-07,4,"It was awesome, best part was the behind the scenes tour! Overall it was a great cute little place, that has wonderful views and has the historic cannery primary structure. WARNING: the cafe sucks... do not go there hungry!!!!!!!! There is nothing but horrible sandwiches and water... recommend the little restaurants on the main roadway."
2693,2009-03-23,4,"Yup  Way kule    (cept for the screaming kids running around like a bunch of idiots)  Just go on weekday'sBut being a member is worth it tho. 'Front of the line'Big line at general admission. 3 in line at the member counter. To top that off, they opened another line and rushed us right through. (A whole 10 second wait)Get rid of the kids----5 stars  (I KNOW   I KNOW    It IS for the kids)"
2694,2014-08-22,5,"A very happy place to be for adults and kids. Their jellies display fantastic, penguin march memorable, and our family is love with luna the otter.  We got membership so trying to make 3 trips there this year ;)"
2695,2014-12-24,5,I really enjoyed the Aquarium. I was enthralled by the sea life they had there. We saw a man in a divers suit . Although being so close to Christmas would have expected him in a Santa Suit. The only thing is the parents don't watch their children. That isn't the Aquariums fault but so many small children shoved me aside. Being disabled that was bothersome. And some of the shows they have were hard to see as there were so many people there it was jammed couldn't hear and couldn't see the monitors that well. But other than that a very enjoyable experience.
2696,2012-07-18,5,"I love aquariums. I love this aquarium. It's absolutely stunning and peaceful to sit in awe the whole day. Your eyes, they will bleed rainbows."
2697,2014-07-18,4,Fun for the whole family. I strongly encourage you take one of the many private tours the aquarium offers; they are very special.
2698,2007-07-28,4,"Vague, sort of disclaimer, I'm a member and intend to renew.Best aquarium I've ever visited - and watching the PBS ""Nature"" special on the place reinforces the concept that the folks who run the place have the creatures' comforts in primary focus when they create the exhibits.They'd get the fifth star if they banned kids (ha! - I know I'm half missing the point).Gotta love the sunfish!"
2699,2015-04-12,4,"Visually this is a really cool place with interesting displays and exhibits . Just wonder what happens to the reject fish that don't survive capture,transportation, and adjustments to living in an aquarium?Do they become food for the other species or the staff?"
2700,2016-04-10,3,"Went today with my 7 & 5 yos. We were there early, right at ""rope drop"" (Disneyland-speak for opening!). First visitors at the jellies! There are of course many cool sights to see, and yes, many many other people also planning to see them. Those other people will not hesitate to push your small child aside. Honestly, I almost can't blame them, because it is SO EXPENSIVE! Rack rate for our family of 4 is $130. I cannot justify that. We were there with free tickets my daughter won at the county fair, and our prior visit 3 years ago was also with free tickets from a friend. I strongly recommend doing what you can to NOT pay rack rate so you don't need to stay all day. We lasted 3 hours... actually, my five year old lasted 2 hours but we pushed her to stay an extra hour. Obviously a mistake the whole family paid for in her tears! We loved/were awed by the Tentacles exhibit, the adorable otters, and all the jellies. It's fun to get the texts to find out about ""spontaneous"" feedings. BYO food, the line at lunchtime was astronomical. My final thought is that (as a vegetarian) I do find it odd that so many exhibits are about ocean conservation, overfishing, etc., and yet they serve fish as food. My son had a couple days earlier expressed interest in trying tuna fish... I asked him if he still felt like it after visiting the aquarium. ""No!"""
2701,2011-08-01,5,"One of the best aquariums I've been to so far, hands down.Huge tanks - gigantic sea turtles, hammerhead sharks, and a huge sunfish make you feel like you're in another world.Their jellyfish display is awesome (nice lighting!).  The new puffin exhibit is super cute.  The seahorse exhibit is great!I love marine life so I could stay here all day, but regardless of how enthused you are about it, there is plenty of exhibits that would intrigue anyone!"
2702,2012-01-04,4,"Wheelchair accessible 4/5 stars ---- the reason for this is, there's no restrooms for family's and the restrooms that the employees were telling my husband to use for accessibility were over run with people. Most folks know that handicap folks need assistants and there was no way I could help him to even get up. A family restroom would be nice for a facility of this size. Parking and side walks to get to the entrance were nicely accessible though some shop out side of the aquarium had stairs around the area and we couldn't get in to, but some also offer side entrances. overall a nice accessible place to visit.... Now yes.. yes... it was fun gorgeous...but also very pricey $30 bucks a person...know though if your disable the price is $19 dollars. I also have to say the café inside the aquarium was stock with good healthy choices. I told my husband ""damn i could go for an apple"" and he said ""yeh, I feel like a banana"" and as we were looking for a snack they had several fresh fruits to choose from...yum*. NOTE: On parking there isn't a parking lot that we saw right there for the aquarium but there were a couple of garages and we parked at one and it had great handicap parking ...Also, if disable and walking is a concern know that there are some hill-ee walks to get to the aquarium after you park, you my want to be dropped off in front first."
2703,2013-07-14,1,Very pricey and no one even checks your tickets. Good for kids.. But that's about it...wouldn't come back.. Just saying.
2704,2012-03-31,5,A must see if you are in Monterey.  After driving up the coast from LA and sightseeing for 6 days we were pretty beat and had debated about spending so much money on the aquarium.  We were immediately energized when we walked through the doors. The Open Sea exhibit is breathtaking; constant motion in a 90 foot tank.  Spectacular.  The octopus feeding was a surprising highlight.  The cafeteria was very crowded so lunch took a long time but the dining area is lovely.   Our boys enjoyed the splash zone with its touch tank.  Our brief visit gave us a wonderful memory.  If you can buy tix online to avoid the lines do it --- and search for street parking.
2705,2012-02-05,5,"Yes, tickets are $32 for adults, but presentation is outstanding!!  Basically, I feel you really do get what you pay for.  The designers were meticulous about each exhibit.  They really allow you to just immerse yourself in the ocean and get you to as close as what you would actually see.  Also, the variety of fish or sea life here is pretty overwhelming.It's a good 2 1/2 to 3 hours or so if you take the time to enjoy your visit.  I felt this was just the right amount of fish for one day.  I'm completely satisfied and stuffffeedddd.P.S. I literally almost cried when I saw the open sea exhibit.. amazing."
2706,2012-08-13,5,"Simply one of the finest aquariums in the country, if not the world.  The main aquatic habitats are enormous, with a bewildering variety of sea life, from large species like hammerhead sharks and sea turtles, to schools of tiny fish studiously avoiding their larger cousins.  Many smaller displays present, on an individual basis, more vulnerable or more dangerous species, such as seahorses and moray eels.  Seabirds are also represented in habitats featuring penguins and puffins.The educational opportunities for children are everywhere.  My eight-year-old son could not get enough of the ""Mission to the Deep"" activity exhibit, in which participants are seated in a NORAD-like control room and perform different interactive undersea exploration missions on touch-sensitive computer screens.  My family also took the ""Behind the Scenes"" tour, which provided a fascinating look at how the Aquarium runs its day-to-day operations in an environmentally-friendly way.Yes, it's a tad expensive ($114 for my family of four, with no discounts applied).  It is worth every penny."
2707,2011-09-05,3,"I echo Dani B.'s sentiments in that my experience here was somewhat ruined by the insane number of kids and the parents who could not control them. It is a great place to take your kids, yes, but parents please keep in mind that there are adults there without children who wish to have a pleasurable experience as well. There were a lot of adults that annoyed me here too, like when they disobeyed the no flash policy and kept continuing to take flash photos without any regard for the animals. I should have chosen another weekend to go (went Labor Day Weekend so it was extra busy) because I felt like I was fighting tooth and nail to see everything and I almost started feeling claustrophobic... not to mention the sporadic stenches of B.O. In spite of all this, I can imagine coming here with a more manageable sized crowd and it is one of the nicest aquariums I have been to. The sea otters? Adorable! Jellyfish exhibit? Always fascinating and beautiful. The great white shark was really small... the sunfish (mola mola) was much more interesting to look at IMO, haha. Love that there are a ton of touch pools for kids and adults.Parking is usually a pain and metered parking nearby is expensive, so be prepared."
2708,2012-08-12,5,"Can't be less than 5 stars - it has to be one of the greatest aquariums in the world! Every aspect of it is excellent. The jellyfish and seahorse exhibits are stunning.TIP#1 : it gets crowded very fast, its a family trip, loads of kids and strollers. Go early and whatever you most want to see - go there firstTIP#2: buy tickets on line so you can walk right in. The regular line can be long and slow."
2709,2015-03-27,3,"A little background, I've been to Shedd's (Chicago), newport aquarium (Cincinnati), Ocean of the Pacific (Long Beach), and Seaworld if you want to count that evil business. I haven't yet to made it to the national aquarium in Atlanta.Monterey Bay was a good aquarium, but it was really small. My boyfriend and I got through the whole thing in an hour and a half! Pretty fast considering it's $40 a person and 3/4 a mile walk to where we parked for $10.The exhibits were all very well done. The information is quick and easy to read, and the exhibit environments really set the mood for each area. It was crowded on the weekend. I would suggest going early in the day. The favorite thing I saw was a cuddlefish changing color. The glass was round, and it looked like the cuddle fish was behind nothing.Overall, this was a good aquarium and the only one in NorCal that I know of. I would recommend it to people already staying in Monterrey, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it."
2710,2014-01-30,4,"My kids have always been so happy and excited to go. We went today and were met with an amazing surprise...it was EMPTY! My kids weren't being shoved by rude people, they were able to see the exhibits, they were able to enjoy and learn in ways that they have never been ale to in the past. We are annual pass holders and typically try to go when we hope there won't be any people, it we have never been this lucky! The staff seemed so much more patient today as compared to other days when the aquarium is more busy. I couldn't be happier to see the smiles on my kids faces!"
2711,2012-01-08,4,"If you like aquariums, you will love this one. It has everything you would expect. The naturalness of it all is amazing!The only drawback is that it was crowded making some exhibits hard to see.They do have a text feature that is really cool, make sure you use it if you go, and you should definitely go!"
2712,2012-01-03,2,"Price: Around $30. But a lot of that goes to research so I'm fine with that.This place, on a weekday, was crowded. Children were running everywhere and it made it hard to enjoy a lot of the exhibits.The staff was friendly from the few that I personally encountered. The fact that this place is world famous made me expect more. My boyfriend and I were traveling from Oregon and our end destination was the aquarium. When we got there, parking was a little farther away than expected. The exhibits were nice, but having been to the aquarium in Paris, the Newport Aquarium in Oregon (Keiko, people!), and of course Sea World, this was underwhelming. They don't have anything I haven't seen many many times before. I'd like to see more marine mammals. The Portland Zoo has more of that than this place.This aquarium is nice to visit once.... if you just happen to live in the area. I don't think I would even make the drive from SF to see it, knowing what I do now. I don't think I'd take the time to come back. Good place to go. Once. Just for the experience."
2713,2011-04-29,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) was founded in 1984 and is located on the former site of a sardine cannery on Cannery Row. I've been one of the happy tourists that has waited in line to get in and enjoy this fantastic facility. However, I don't feel the same way about the rest of Cannery Row. After the visit to the MBA has concluded, we're usually quickly on our way to the sights of Carmel or 17 Mile Drive. The Aquarium holds thousands of plants and animals, representing hundreds separate named species on display. The aquarium benefits by a high circulation of fresh ocean water which is obtained through pipes which pump it in continuously from Monterey Bay. Among the aquarium's numerous exhibits, two are of particular note: The centerpiece of the Ocean's Edge Wing is a 10 33-foot high, 1.3 million liter tank for viewing California coastal marine life. In this tank, the aquarium was the first in the world to grow live California Giant Kelp, using a wave machine at the top of the tank, allowing sunlight in through the open tank top, and circulation of raw seawater from the Bay. The second exhibit of note is a 4.5 million liter tank in the Outer Bay Wing which features one of the world's largest single-paned windows. Sea life on exhibit includes stingrays, jellyfish, sea otters, and numerous other native marine species, which can be viewed above and below the waterline. For displaying jellyfish, the MBA uses an aquarium called a Kreisel tank which creates a circular flow to support and suspend the jellies. Visitors are able to inspect the creatures of the kelp forest at several levels in the building. But what really makes my pointed ears twitch is the Aquarium's appearance as the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito in the 1986 film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The main aquarium was overlaid with special effects to appear to be the tank home of two humpback whales - George and Gracie. At the end of the movie, humanity was saved, and like me you might learn some similar sustainability lessons after spending several hours here."
2714,2012-08-04,4,"There are touch tanks and other hands-on exhibits to keep little kids occupied. However, the admission price was very expensive. $35 per head.I thought the jellyfish exhibit (both of them) were very well done. It was an overall good experience, but I'm not sure I'll be back for a while. You can see everything in about an hour and a half."
2715,2011-06-05,5,"This place is awesome. But it gets pretty crazy when it's crowded. Kids running around everywhere, people banging into you with strollers, lines to see the otters... it may test your patience with people, but it's pretty hard not to be impressed with some of the stuff they've got there. Unfortunately the gigantic shark tank was closed for renovations on our last visit, which was a bummer. I remember that being the coolest thing they had, so be sure it's open if you're going to visit. I seem to recall more jellyfish when I was a kid too... but maybe they switch out the exhibits. The pink flamingos exhibit was a little dull, but the sea horses next door made up for that. And who doesn't think sea otters and penguins are hilarious? So yes, even if you don't have kids in tow, this place is a must see when you visit Monterey. It can be a little pricey, but if you're staying at a hotel in the area (we were at the Plaza), they will sell you 2-day passes for the price of one at the front desk (about $40). I don't know if you need to go for two days, but if nothing else you get to skip the line. This place is definitely worth seeing!!"
2716,2014-07-31,5,It's an amazing aquarium - probably still one of the best that exists. Get there early because it gets crowded.
2717,2016-02-22,1,"This place is not worth your money!!! Beware there's also an old woman who will snitch on you if you decide to eat on the great tide pool benches. This lady was wearing a blue sweater and blue jeans and she wears glasses. Me and my family were about to eat a salad when a Chinese man came over and told us that we could not eat because the birds were hungry. Lame right...the old lady who did not mind her tham business sent him to us. Yet, there is NOT any signs that say do not eat in the ""tide pool benches"". Anyway there is not that many animals like there used to be 8 years ago. If you do find them they are either hiding or dead at the bottom of the tank. I will not be coming here again because its just not worth it anymore...I will be going to San Francisco they say theres more animals and its cheaper."
2718,2012-07-29,5,"I have been wanting to go here for so long! It was really fun! It is such a huge aquarium and there is so much to see. It is worth the amount. It has everything that you would want to see. They also had some jazz music playing. And its a nice location for a sunny day. It is a little expensive, but all tourist spots are."
2719,2012-05-22,5,A lot of fun! It's very well laid out and the exhibits are all very interesting. Don't miss the lookout in the back to see some epic views of the ocean.Check out some of the great places to eat within walking distance of the Aquarium to finish off the day!
2720,2016-03-21,4,"This is my fourth otter-friendly aquarium I've visited this year, and I consider myself a bit of an otter freak, so you otter know what I think! We are a group of four adults and two kids, so we purchased the Ocean Advocate membership for this trip. This was equitable to a day pass for each of us, but came with some perks like no line entry, tour discounts, and gift shop discounts. The behind the scenes otter/aquarium tour was good and helped me understand the research based function of the aquarium, but wasn't actually that exciting - there was nothing you wouldn't see on the other side of the glass. The otter exhibit was smaller than I anticipated, but upon learning about the work they do and their focus on retuning orphaned otters to the wild, the size made perfect sense. The three otters in the exhibit are surrogate moms and serving an important function in maintaining the wild otter colony in Monterey.  I appreciated the text messages when a feeding was happening. The volunteers at all exhibits were patient and friendly. Cindy's restaurant had excellent food and views; I'd recommend reservations in advance. The aquarium itself has great architecture, is easy to navigate, and each space has great information about the animals within. In all I enjoyed my trip there very much. If you are going for just the otters, you might be disappointed, so be sure to plan ahead for a total aquarium experience."
2721,2011-10-03,4,"Do    Arrive early & get a good parking spot.    Bring a camera, walking shoes & your patience.    Pack a lunch - food is pricy if you buy onsite.    Some people can get done in 3 hours, but some take all day - and why not, especially since you paid so much to get in (even though it goes to a very good cause).Don't    Did not like the lack of a parking lot/structure    Be in a rush, there is lots to see.Husband and I had a great time - bit crowded, but so worth the drive.  We saw lots of things we had not seen in person . Beautiful exhibits - never seen so many different jelly fish or seahorses!  One of the main reasons of going was not only to promote this extremely wonderful organization but to see the sea otters!  Adorable.  We were lucky to be able to see their newest temporary great white shark as well.Love the mission behind what this aquarium does - "" ""to inspire conservation of the oceans.""   Monterey Aquarium does amazing things involving protecting endangered wildlife, promoting the fight against climate change.  Lots of driving for a short trip, but definitely worth it.  We want to go back down to Monterey/Carmel when we have more time and explore more of the area."
2722,2014-07-25,5,"Great place we stumbled across on our way to the aquarium. Good food, great beers and service. Check it out if you're in the area"
2723,2012-07-24,5,"This is the best aquarium! It's so thoughtfully put together. At every turn, I found myself thinking, ""that was a brilliant idea"".  It's more than just looking at cool fish and aquatic mammals. The exhibits are setup in such a way that kids (and adults) are learning without even realizing it. It's not just reading informational signs about the animals. We spent one morning and one afternoon here. My 10 year old did the underwater explorers special class.  It's was expensive, but so great.  Kids go into a tidal pool with full scuba gear and a certified instructor.  Really this place is worth a trip across the country to visit!"
2724,2014-07-24,5,"I have been here twice, a week ago and in 2005.  I can't say enough about this aquarium, it is amazing and probably the best I have been too!  If you are in Monterey, it is a must see!"
2725,2012-03-06,2,Was very small for the price. The shed aquarium in Chicago will always be my favorite.
2726,2011-09-11,5,"I'm seriously in love with this aquarium. My parents are members and that means that my boyfriend and I get in free with their guest passes. I have a 2 year old daughter also and she's free until she hits 3 years old, which is nice too!Coming on the weekends it's pretty busy. Lots and lots and lots of small children everywhere but parents are always close behind. The Splash Zone for kids is great and they even have an area for smaller children that has a lot of stuff to climb on, under, through and over. Any child that can walk would have a blast playing in these 2 sections of the aquarium. The staff is SUPER friendly, helpful and fairly knowledgable about many of the animals in the aquarium. All of the animals have adequately sized enclosures and I believe they also circulate animals on and off from being on display (which is great for the animals of course!). The dimmed lighting in many of the hallways makes the exhibits all the more bright and interesting. I loved spending the day walking around and looking at all the cool marine life! There are several gift shops throughout the aquarium too. The main one near the entrance has a little bit of something for everyone. They also had a wider selection of children's books than I recall from past visits here. Lots of affordable toys for kids starting at just $1.99 too.We'll be spending many more days in the future walking around this aquarium and marveling at the beauty in the exhibits. It's best to go during the week of course if you don't want to deal with the hoards of people that come in for the weekend, otherwise - get there right before 10AM and you'll beat some of the rush."
2727,2011-12-11,5,"Easily one of the best aquariums on the West Coast!  All sea creatures have an exhibit here...jelly fish, starfish, seahorses, octopi!  I just can't get enough, and if I lived closer I'd probably visit twice a year.Be sure to check out the touch pool-- you will enjoy it if you are an adult or kid.  There is an outdoor splash pool, as well as an observation deck where one can spot sea otters, birds, boaters, etc.Remember that the price of your ticket goes towards research and conservation.  (If you are active duty military check out the ITT office at the Monterey Language Institute-- you will save a few bucks on each ticket.)xoxo"
2728,2012-11-20,3,"Worth seeing if you're in or near Monterey. Admission is (unfortunately) steep. Discount tickets seem hard to find. FYI, if you're in Southern California, the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is larger, with more to see and do, esp for kids and costs less to get in. I would say that the Monterey Bay Aquarium is in a nicer location: on the open ocean, vs in an industrial port (Long Beach). Yes, it's worth a visit."
2729,2006-12-01,5,"The Monterey aquarium is simply amazing.   We came here in the Spring and spent several hours looking at the shark and the jellyfish exhibits.  The jellyfish exhibit blew my mind... It's like nature bitchslapped a couple of million artists and said to them, ""beat this, by-atchhh!""  After a few hours walking around the place, we headed back up to the Bay Area.  I was hungry so I told my wife to stop at BK so I could pick up a Filet of Fish.   Yummy!"
2730,2009-04-20,5,"I have been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium too many times to count. Although sometimes I was bored, considering I have seen everything there is to be seen, I couldn't help but marvel at the wonders that can be seen there. It makes me proud to call Monterey Bay my hometown."
2731,2009-06-27,4,"Our two year old loves aquariums, whether it's the Seattle aquarium back home or the Vancouver BC aquarium.  Staying in the Bay area during the summer, we had to make a trip to the Monterey Bay aquarium...  We're so happy that we did but being known as one of the best aquariums in the US (with the painfully high $30 per person ticket price) there were some things they could have definitely been done better.We loved the kelp forest and the jellyfish exhibit with such beautiful tranquil looking creatures.  The seahorse exhibit was amazing as well with its soft lilting music and fairytale like atmosphere as one progressed through the rooms.  It was also extremely thoughtful that the aquarium had set up children/toddler areas with slides (in the otter area and near the splash area) and play areas with water which were perfect to help distract and re-energize a little one as her parents tried to stay longer at the aquarium to help justify the entrance fee...But, I was so surprised that there weren't any outdoor exhibits.  With the massive amounts of people that are visiting the aquarium it can get really stuffy and warm...The Seattle aquarium and Vancouver aquarium both have great outdoor exhibits for the otters and penguins, I was so surprised that although you could step outside to see beautiful views of Monterey Bay that you couldn't see the otters from the outside (only from the stuffy and very crowded viewing window on the inside)...Also, having a two year old she is particularly fascinated with the exhibits where she can put her hand in the water and feel starfish, coral, and other little creatures.  Although the hand sanitizer post the touching was much appreciated, the water in some of those exhibits really seemed stagnant quite different from our experience at the Seattle aquarium which has some great touch pools for the little ones...So all in all, a fun day at the aquarium but there were things that it could have definitely done better..."
2732,2012-09-30,5,"I had wanted to visit this aquarium since it was built and finally got the chance to visit it this month. It was worth the wait. I am not an aquarium person, this was probably the first aquarium that I visited in 30 years, but this was fantastic. Its nice to see an aquarium as dedicated as they are to the fish and wildlife that are native to the area that the aquarium is in.I loved the jellyfish area. They way it is lit up is incredible. I took pictures of it and people thought that it was a computer generated image."
2733,2016-07-09,3,"Great aquarium and sights. Downside is bought 2 day tickets and as we left at closing day 1 told it opens at 9am next morning. Arrived to see ""members"" entering through side door at 9am and stood out front tickets in hand with 2 young kids for 40 min. Employee wasn't helpful to make that right."
2734,2014-07-15,5,World class. Exhibits first class. Gets crowded with lots of children. Metered parking for four hours. Opens 930 am
2735,2012-01-09,5,"There's a reason this aquarium is world-famous.  Quality exhibits, conservation, education, and fun!  Whether you are coming with small children who want to see otters, penguins, or clown fish (be prepared to hear numerous screams of ""It's NEMO!!!"" on a busy day), you are an adult who wants to learn about the ecology and responsible management of sea life, or you're a kid at heart wanting to marvel at the huge tanks and beautiful jelly fish, this is the place for you!  For your old favorites, your new favorites, and things you've never even imagined; The Monterey Bay Aquarium is place of inspiration, wonder, and excitement!  Be prepared for large cowds on weekends and during the spring/summer.  Try to get there early and you'll get your run of the place!"
2736,2012-11-12,4,"First time here. Had a great time, but I expected to see more, compared to other aquiriums I've been to."
2737,2011-04-10,5,What a beautiful aquarium! We had a friend visiting from India and we are so happy we brought him here. He said he has never seen anything like this place in his life.Also it was my 7 month old baby's first trip to an aquarium and his eyes were soooo big staring at all the sea animals. He absolutely loved it as he observed everything around him.I was also EXTREMELY grateful for the little rocking chair in the women's restroom where I could turn it around to face the wall and nurse my little baby in semi privacy and not having to worry about an accidental flashing of any men since my baby now likes to pull the cover off him. I wish everyone had something simple like that in their facilities. Also great changing table area too by the rocking chair.We purchased the big membership so that we can come back all the time with our friends too. $200 of the $250 fee is tax deductible!
2738,2011-04-11,3,"Big Problem:The whole day at the aquarium you are bombarded by guilt trips and *helpful* advice on how to save and heal and preserve our glorious, life giving oceans.Right now, there are these posters all over with sad little themes like, ""Daddy, why are all the fish dead?"" ""Because nobody cared dear, nobody cared...""There are the stations that show you all the ways you can make your home more energy efficient, and how to eat only sustainable seafood, etc., etc. There are coloring pages for kids to write and draw how they would save the earth/planet/ocean.And then I go into the gift shop. Bins and bins and shelf upon shelf overflowing with nasty, plastic, piece of shit, useless toys all MADE IN CHINA.Really? China? The China that has the lax environmental regulations? The China that sneaks lead and toxic crap into their toys and baby food? Shouldn't the aquarium practice what it preaches? How about the Monterey Bay Aquarium starts by steering kids away from consumerism gift shop toy lust. And then, only sell locally made, environmentally sound items that parallel the message they've been shoving down everyone's throat their entire visit.Up until the gift shop, I was totally digging it and planning my meatless Mondays...."
2739,2011-05-20,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is the Disneyland of fish, it's that awesome. What's not to love? HUGE tanks filled with sharks, otters, eels, octopi, otters, etc. Almost every exhibit is meant to be interactive and it's amazing how much you learn spending the day here. On a nice day you can enjoy the sun on their huge outdoor deck and if you're lucky you might spot a whale or some dolphins. This is a great date place to bring your girlfriend/boyfriend for the day. It's still just as much fun as I remember from coming here as a kid."
2740,2016-01-05,5,Wow!! I traveled to California for the first time last spring and I had the privilege of visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The facility is really wonderful and features lots of cool exhibits as well as a couple places to eat and a gift shop. I love the jellyfish!!
2741,2013-07-05,2,"Monterey Bay Aquarium bills itself as a top institution, but buries its modest collection of literal sea-life in a figurative sea of distractions. Each tank, which is beautifully constructed, is labelled with a single factoid. Generally it doesn't tell you where the creature you're looking at comes from, nor much else about it.It seems to be afraid of educating lest somebody gets turned off by having to read something. If you treat children like they have brains, they're more likely to act as if they do.Why is the jellyfish room filled with pseudo-psychedelia and Jimi Hendrix quotes?The sea-horse room says something like ""see the stripes on their faces and you'll know what they really are,"" but then never tells us what those stripes mean. Are they zebras?If you want to see some impressive sea creatures, go to Baltimore instead."
2742,2016-07-01,5,Great experience and a walk through history as machinery from the cannery days are present and integrated in the presentation.
2743,2014-09-11,5,We took our first family vacation to Monterey. My son is 14 months old so we wanted to do something he could enjoy. The aquarium was great. Super family friendly. Plenty of bathrooms and there are changing stations in both men's and women's restrooms. They sell a two day pass that costs the same as the one day pass. The employees and volunteers are helpful and friendly. You can get there when they open leave for lunch and then go back for the afternoon shows. We had a great time. I will definitely return and maybe even become a member.
2744,2016-06-30,4,"4 stars because they don't have designated smoking regions at the aquarium.  Also, they're on you like Gestapo when you decide to light a cigarette 300 feet away from nearest civilian or entrance.  Only in California where you can breathe in exhaust smoke from 300 cars traveling by you per minute, but you'll raise eyebrows at the first sight of a person smoking...sigh!  Aside from that, the place was great.  A must see if you're in the region."
2745,2011-06-14,5,"I'll never understand Ariel's dilemma. I'm with Sebastian all the way. This aquarium is truly amazing - well I find all aquariums to be pretty awesome, but this one especially so. My favorite part was the jellyfish exhibit and the kelp tank. I didn't ever want to leave the kelp tank... very cool.  All of the exhibits and tanks were entertaining and beautiful, especially the seahorse tanks which I had never seen before. Things to consider: it was pretty crowded so consider going during unusual hours or a weekday. if you have kids, bring a leash."
2746,2011-07-27,5,"Oh, la, la!  What a tremendous visit, what a great cause!  This aquarium gives you the ability to see the beauty of so many aspects of the ocean, that you would otherwise only see on a discovery channel special!  the place is packed, take snacks, be patient, have a few  bucks for parking (10-20$$$$, park at CVS up the street for $15).Plan out what you want to see, ""Open Ocean"" is wonderful, the new Octopus exhibit is cool.  Really exciting place, your $$$ go to a good cause of conservation, and you will be amazed at every turn!"
2747,2009-01-05,3,"I can't remember the last time I payed $29.95 to walk through a museum... not even the Louvre in Paris!BUT - the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great place to wonder for a day of learning and unexpected finds.  The amount of information that is available to visitors is absolutely amazing.  The Otter exhibit was really fascinating, and I found myself wishing I could play with them after we moved on to the next area of the museum.  There is a large cafe on the first floor next to the otter exhibit, and there is also the museum store to your right.I definitely recommend walking outside to take in the views if you have an opportunity because you may see some unexpected wildlife while perusing."
2748,2010-01-17,5,"This is a great aquarium and I highly recommend itTickets are pricey: $30.00/adult, but well worth it.  They have a outer bay exhibit, seahorse exhibit, touch pools, penguins, and some of my favorites:  the sea otter exhibit, kelp forest, and jelly fish exhibit.  I came here with some college friends, and we spent about three hours here looking at the amazing sea wild life and animals.  We probably could have spent even more if here it weren't for the other parts of Monterey we wanted to check out.  Question:  Why are there sharks in the kelp forest?  Watch out little fishes--don't get eaten!  The feeding times and shows they have are also very cool.  I also like the parts that are integrated with Monterey Bay itself--the tide pool and  outdoor.  Anyways, check out my pics and the many pictures people have uploaded to get an idea of the breath-taking sights here.  Oh yeah, bring a camera (many exhibits are difficult to take pictures of, because they are dark).  It is definitely worth the visit."
2749,2016-06-27,5,"It's an awesome place to spend the day learning about all the interesting creatures in and outside the sea. Admission is a bit expensive but considering this is a non-profit institution that relies primarily on donations and does a lot of great work and research, it's worth your money. The sea otters are adorable and we even spotted some in the wild off the back deck (sometimes you can see whales too). If you want to explore Cannery Row or other sites in the area, you can get your hand stamped for re-entry to the aquarium. I remember coming here as a child, but it's just as fun now as it was back then."
2750,2012-06-21,5,"I love this place. The exhibits are good and their special exhibits are spot on. The staff is very knowledgeable and incredibly friendly. Always smiling and ready to answer questions. They had the special jellyfish exhibit going when we were there last and it was very well done. The seahorse exhibit is great! Beautiful weedy sea dragons and teeny, tiny baby seahorses. The open ocean exhibit is beautiful and really cool during feeding. I can't wait to come back!"
2751,2011-03-21,4,"A beautiful aquarium in a perfect location.  True, Monterey's Cannery Row is touristy as hell, but the history is fascinating and you just can't beat the views.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium blends nicely with the bay just outside its doors.I love the hands-on exhibits, the jelly fish, the otters and the penguins.  Actually, there aren't many negatives here.  It is rather expensive (the gift shop included), and it's too crowded most of the time.  But what can you do --  it comes with the territory.  Luckily, there are a few places to hide out from the crowds and take a breather.  Be sure to give yourself lots of time to see and do everything."
2752,2016-01-03,5,"This is the best aquarium and I've been to many all over the world.  The exhibits include my favorites of jellies,  nautilus, and feedings.  We come each year and they always have a new exhibit added which makes it a wonderful experience.  The crowds are extremely heavy on weekends so it is good to show up early.  We have added the special tours $15 each for non-members for the last few years.  This year,  we decided to become members which is only $50 more for a family of four and worth it because we are not just supporting the aquarium but getting discounts on the tours of $3 each and 10% off at the gift-shop (and we always find cool stuff). They have an deep sea ocean exhibit that offers an amazing broad window spanning 50 feet long with tuna, sea turtles,  a large school of sardines and sharks.  My favorite are the jellies which they have in multiple tanks. Their variety and colors are accompanied with great quotes and descriptions so that I learn something new each visit. The kids have enjoyed this every year from toddler to teen."
2753,2014-10-19,5,"This is the best Pacific coastal exhibit. Excellent tidal pool, jellyfish, nautalist, tuna, turtle, sardine, anchovy, hammerhead and leopard shark, sea nettle, cuttlefish, and many other great water creatures. Kids will enjoy the numerous hands on exhibits."
2754,2011-06-29,4,"Sea Otters are the cutest little creatures in the world!My boyfriend and I came to Monterey Bay Aquarium this past Sunday around 4pm. We thought that the aquarium was closing at 5pm because according to Yelp it says they close at 5pm so we were rushing to the aquarium. Luckily they actually close at 6pm so it gave us well over an hour and a half to walk through the aquarium. I thought that there would be dolphins and whales or something, but unfortunately this isn't Marine World so they didn't have whale or dolphins. There are many exhibits and many activities for children. My favorite exhibit were the sea otters. They are so cute and friendly. They'll swim up to windows and you can watch them play. It's fun to see all of the different fishes and fish displays. Everything is beautiful. I felt like I was in an entirely different world. There's so much to see that I can't even write it all down. Make sure you bring your camera. Monterey Bay Aquarium is great for all ages. This was my first time at an aquarium and I'm glad I came to Monterey."
2755,2011-03-19,5,"This was a great aquarium.  My kids love going to aquariums and this is the best I'veever been to.  They had a lot of hands on, computer interactive, and live interation exhibits.  Even as an adult I learned about out conservation and ocean life in general.  My particilar favorite exhibit was the penguin display and the hot pink flamingos.  We easily spent 5 hours there (including time to eat in their cafe.)  Also, everyone there is very friendly and the premises is clean.  By the way, their cafe is pretty good too. A little pricey, as all attraction food can be.  However, what set them apart is that they don't just serve hot dogs, burgers, and pizza.  They had mufolata sandwiches, a roasted butternut squash/bell pepper sandwich, spiniach salads, etc.  Everything looked gourmet and high quality."
2756,2011-12-30,5,"What can you say, this aquarium is famous and there's a good reason.  It's huge, the exhibits are amazing, and it seems like every employee you bump into can tell you tons about anything you'd like to know.Love the jellies, sea horses, and penguins.If you live nearby, get a membership because you're going to want to go back."
2757,2014-04-07,4,"This aquarium is awesome!  Yes, it costs money, but then again, how else do you think they are going to keep the doors open and care for the marine life?  The touch pool, the various creatures, and friendly staff all make it a must do!"
2758,2014-04-06,4,"This is one of the better aquariums I've been too and especially impressive for the relatively small size (hometown Baltimore Aquarium still takes the cake in my book).  Lots of fun things to see for little ones, especially the Open Sea and jellyfish exhibits.  The day we went they had a very cool fifteen minute presentation about their Great White Shark research that my five year old son was attentive throughout because he was so interested, which is a rarity to say the least.  Monterey Bay Aquarium is a solid annual venture."
2759,2008-09-13,4,"The woman at the ticket window was pleasant.I enjoyed the aquarium immensely. We were lucky enough to see the sea otters being fed, which was very entertaining. I was prepared for bad crowds and lots of kids since it was a Saturday and my premonition was far from wrong. I think if I go again, I'd make it on a weekday.This is probably the first and only museum or aquarium that I've been to that doesn't force you to exit through a gift shop, which I kind of appreciated."
2760,2012-05-05,5,"This might be the best aquarium in the US.A little bit of everything. Hands-on displays for the little ones. Amazing views of sharks and octopus and penguins and manta rays and... and... and...The only possible downside to this place is that everyone else knows how awesome it is. So if you come on a holiday weekend, you can expect to get buried in human flesh.Plan on three hours if you really want to see everything. And bring your sense of wonder."
2761,2014-08-22,5,The aquarium is hands down one of the top five attractions in california. You need to allow yourself a minimum of 3 hours to take in all the awesomeness here. If you can try to do an add on tour like the jellyfish exhibit. Our guide was named Clint Jones (originally from Louisiana) and he was amazing. Go LSU tigers hahaha.
2762,2014-12-09,5,"A must see, always love seeing the sea otters, prvate events, if invited you must see at night, spectactular venue"
2763,2016-04-17,5,"Fantastic, well maintained, staffed with super friendly volunteers. Great for any age."
2764,2011-06-06,2,"Hadn't been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in years and decided to revisit with girlfriend, who had never been. Perhaps if we had kids this would've been better as it seemed geared to the ""12 and under"" crowd. Arts and crafts, sea otter puppets...you get the idea.While some of the exhibits were ok (thought the sea horse exhibit was the best) I didn't find myself in awe of much and kept thinking I wish I was at Steinhart aquarium in SF. In addition, this annoying music with harps and bells seems to be playing in the background the whole time you are there. In conclusion, combine thousands of screaming kids with Zamfir magic harp music and a few yellow tangs in large aquariums and you get the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Left with a ""is that all there is"" feeling."
2765,2014-04-30,5,"Their is nothing that can top this, when we went to Cannery Row and visited the aquarium and had a GREAT WHITE SHARK, that was the bomb, meaning awesome, star struck, a thing of beauty. The kids were, what that word: SHOCKED, that their was a shark in the tank. Not any shark, but JAWS. The movie... If you haven't been here you need to go, can you say, one more time, awesome... 5 star for sure, the kids still remember, Jaws ; ).."
2766,2016-06-17,5,I would like to especially thank Stefany of Cindy's Waterfront dining and the Monterey Bay Aquarium medics for assisting my wife who was coughing when pieces of food became lodged in her windpipe. Stefany was with us the entire time while the medics helped resolve my wife's issues. They came and went without drawing attention to themselves. We were able to continue our tour and had a great lunch that afternoon at Cindy's Waterfront restaurant. The exhibits were fabulous and the help friendly and professional. We will return again.
2767,2008-07-10,4,"JELLY FISH. JELLY FISH. JELLY FISH. under blue light. trippy.ooohhhh. and PENGUINS. but the best are the SEA OTTERS. so cute. loveable. furry. fun. better exhibit than the penguins.the aquarium: absolutely brilliant. knowlegable staff. great exhibits. wish it were bigger, not so crowded. but thanks for the toddler area where all the tired parents bring their toddlers to play in water before leaving. brilliant way to give us a break. had a great time there but next time i think i will plan for a weekday and not a holiday weekend. why did everyone have the same idea i did?"
2768,2009-09-09,4,This place is awesome. I came here once as a child and i don't think i was able to appreciate it as much as I did as an adult.So it's Labor day weekend and we didn't make any get away plans. Not wanting to waste the long weekend and the great weather a day trip to Monterey came to mind. Of course you can't go to Monterey without checking out the aquarium. Seeing the commercials for the Secret Life of Seahorses did peak my interest. I have to say it is a enjoyable way to spend a few hours on lazy holiday weekend :) The seahorse exhibit was really amazing. Something i doubt I'd ever see outside of a aquarium. Never knew there where that many different species of seahorses. Also watching the sea otters being fed and playing was pretty cool. I was a little disappointed that the great white  shark they had was not one of the huge Jaw's style man eating beasts but i guess that wouldn't work very well since it would probably not fit in the tank and there would be no other fish around haha. I'm glad we decided to to do this day trip the only reason why I'm giving the Aquarium 4 stars is that $29 seems a bit pricey. I'm sure up keep is expensive but man 2 tix for almost $60 hurt haha. Though everybody should at least check it out once as a adult.
2769,2009-12-15,5,"We decided to drive up on Thanksgiving weekend and it's been a few years since I've been there. My son has never been and I knew it was going to be a treat! It was amazing! The drive was so worth it! The seahorse exhibit was so cool and the little creatures are so beautiful! I also love the hands-on stations for my son. He loved to dive in and touch the stars and other creatures. It was very crowded the day we went, Saturday, November 28th, but that was probably because it was the holiday weekend. We got there late, so I'm sure it was even more crowded earlier in the day.  We still got to take our time and looked at all the exhibits.What a wonderful day and my son wants to go back and spend the weekend in Monterey!"
2770,2011-06-17,5,"One word: spectacular!  This place has so much going for it, both to observe and to learn about.  The displays of fish, sea otters, penguins, turtles, jelly fish, etc. are all amazing to see.  And many of the fish are rescues who otherwise would not survive in the wild.  The education center is great for kids, and there's plenty of information for all."
2771,2014-08-14,4,"The aquarium was fun. We only spent a couple of hours, as it was on our way back driving to LA, but if you really did everything, it probably would take 3. A lot of fun things for kids (which we skipped).  We caught the feeding of the penguins, and a presentation on White Sharks, which was REALLY interesting - I would recommend watching it.Loved the jelly fish section, they were amazing.Parking was a little weird though. It was so busy in the streets, we couldn't really find out if there was a parking lot somewhere, and ended up at a metered street parking. Now that was a bit of a pain:- meter only took quarters (no credit card, no other coins)- the change machines, 3 of them, were all out of order. Yup all 3.- the merchants around cannot give you change, unless you purchase something. Ended up having to buy a $1 tiny square of chocolate to get quarters. Now that is a review on its own, which I am going to write: $1 for a square of chocolate at Candy World. DO NOT GO THERE, it is so expensive!Back to the aquarium: Price is a little high ($40 a person), but overall worth it (you have to think of all the expenses they have to make, between personnel, maintenance, research, etc...)"
2772,2017-01-02,1,"This seems to be a victim of its own success.  TOO MANY PEOPLE!  We were there the Tuesday after Christmas.  The place was packed.  You could hardly move around -- there were so many people pushing, shoving, trying to get by.  That meant the exhibits themselves were hard to see, especially for the 5-year old we had with us.  You couldn't get close to the front and take part in the interactive stuff for kids.  The restaurant was so packed that every table was taken, and people were wandering around with full trays just hoping to come upon someone vacating a table.  We lasted about 1 hour.  For that we'd paid $210.00 (2 adults, 2 seniors, 1 child). Not a bargain.  And yet, back at the hotel, we saw all the lovely TV ads for the aquarium, with a young couple strolling leisurely from one exhibit to another, with not another person in sight.  That might be the dream.  But the reality is VERY different.  They really need to adopt some Disney-like crowd management techniques to help people see everything in an orderly manner.  So, if you go, expect to pay a lot and push a lot.  Chances are you'll be happy when you leave, not necessarily for being there, but for getting out of there!"
2773,2014-07-04,3,"I came to visit aquarium with my husband and in-laws and I was bored. $40/per adult is too expensive for what you are getting. ho-hum on everything. It is very spacious and you will not be bumping into people too much but for all the hype and Yelp reviews I guess I was expecting much more. my bad.The only exhibit worthy of our time was the one where hammerhead shark, turtle and multiple species of fish were floating around...""Open Sea"" or something like that. We went to second floor and viewed this tank. My MIL was bored so she left us to go shopping in the shopping/food area. I went to all the exhibits because I wanted and was waiting for the ""aha""moment where I would feel this place was out of this world and amazing too. It didn't happen.  Gorgeous views and will be back once we have children. This is a great place for children."
2774,2012-02-07,5,"Simply...Woohoo! As good as it gets!Beautiful, informative exhibits. It *is* on the expensive side, but I think it's better than any other aquarium I've been to, including Shedd in Chicago.If you live in the area, I think becoming a member is the way to go. That way you can go frequently and bring guests for no charge."
2775,2014-08-08,5,"This is an awesome aquarium! I grew up in Baltimore which has a fantastic aquarium and I'd say this one is just as good. I love the huge tanks that have lots of diverse sea animals. I could stare at them for hours. The jellyfish exhibit is also a must-see. The touch exhibits seemed good too, but I'm more of a looker."
2776,2012-01-06,5,"What's not to love about the Monterey Bay Aquarium?  Great exhibits and offerings specifically for little ones, such as a babies and toddlers play area.  Our favorite exhibits were the giant octopus, the Open Sea (where you can see sea turtles, hammerhead sharks, rays, and sun fish), and sea otters.  They also have feeding times, where you can watch a diver feed sharks.  This is especially neat.   Other nice features include numerous touch pools, and play areas for toddlers and young kids.  The aquarium definitely gets crowded, but it is because it's a great and popular aquarium.  Also, I'm not sure what else there is to do with kids in Monterey!  We arrived around 3pm, and I was surprised that it was still really busy.  The crowd thinned out significantly by 5pm.  Overall, a must see for families."
2777,2014-04-17,5,This is one of the best aquariums I've ever seen in my life so far! There are various rooms to visit your friendly sea creatures and an enormous shark tank that'll keep you in awe. This aquarium will last you more than 2-3 hours. Great place to visit if you're up in Monterey Bay.
2778,2011-04-01,5,"This is one of my most favorite places in the world. I remember coming here as a kid soon after it first opened and it was always one of my fondest childhood memories.I believe it had a part in setting me up to be a permanent fish/aquarium geek, and there's nothing wrong with that. Even though I'm a grownup and spent years working in a pet store and with aquatic critters, I still get so excited at the touch pool. I go back to being 5 years old, squealing that I get to pet a starfish! (which is a misnomer-they are technically sea stars, since they are not fish!)We got to see the seahorse exhibit last year which was really exciting. We have about 800 pictures of seahorses. We could've stayed in there all day. I can't believe I still haven't set up a seahorse tank yet!We also went on the behind-the-scenes tour. I had never known they had this before, and we really enjoyed it. I think it was about an hour long, and we got to see the shark travel tank, hear funny stories about it, and see all the equipment. We also got up close to the shark quarantine tanks and could climb up and look down into the pools. The coolest part was being at the top of the huge 3-story aquarium and looking down into it! It was also neat that we were able to take pictures.There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said before. Next time I'd like to come on a weekday so it won't be as busy. I never get tired of coming back."
2779,2011-05-12,4,"This place is awesome. By far the best aquarium anywhere that I know of. I went back for my first time in a few years and it's every bit as great. They now have flamingos and some very cool sea horses. I'm a bit of a penguin freak so naturally I'm partial to the penguin exhibit. My very obliging husband even was willing to stay there until it was penguin feeding time (3pm) on one visit. It was literally wall-to-wall strollers and small children gathered round for feeding time...and then there was us; me grinning from ear to ear. That's a loving husband for 'ya.The aquarium also has a really awesome iPhone app. In addition to the little printed sustainable seafood guides for different areas of the US, the app will, among other things, guides you to Monterey area restaurants with sustainable seafood choices. The museum is pricey ($27 for adults), but when you consider the cost of electricity alone & all the other maintenance involved it makes sense. You can usually find $2 off coupons online. AAA will also give you $3 off, but only if you obtain advanced tickets at an AAA office."
2780,2007-06-07,3,"I kind of found myself being bored during my visit yesterday. I remember liking it a few years ago? What happened!The new otter exhibit is fun.I AM WILD ABOUT OTTERS!  Two different kinds of otters playing around. They are cute to watch fight each other. The aquarium looks cool from the outside and is well decorated on the inside... but it felt weird walking around. I didn't find a good direction to go in, I felt kinda lost the whole time.Being able to touch some ocean plants and a few animals was legit. But the animal lover in me couldn't stop thinking about how much they must hate it."
2781,2011-07-25,5,My family buys season passes for this place. I've literally been to aquariums all over the country and none are even comparable! I grew up in Monterey so it's a staple
2782,2011-03-07,5,"So much fun!  Not enough time to do everything!  Must spend a whole day here!I was last here more than 10 years ago, and I've still got my membership card from 1996 (now obsolete but a collector's item, apparently).I don't remember much about the aquarium since my last visit was so long ago, so when the trip was suggested, I couldn't wait.  So excited!  I love sea life.  Even though I can't swim, I'm absolutely fascinated by creatures that live or spend a lot of time in the water.  It's amazing how diverse the environment and culture is down below in liquid life.  You can be almost any shape, color, size, and configuration.  Anything goes in the sea.First stop, sea otters!  Adorable!  All of the sea otters in this famous exhibit are female (population control?) and so much bigger than I thought.   Sea otters are about the size of medium dogs, but SO MUCH CUTER.  Love their little paws, the playfulness, the grooming, and the buoy-like manner of floating at the top of the water on their backs.  I could watch them all day.Notable exhibits to visit: sea horses (such amazing creatures with curly ends..), penguins penguins penguins, pink flamingos (watch for the one-legged-to-two transition, it'll get you! Where do they stick that leg??), the kelp forest (amazing!! It's so peaceful watching the gentle natural sway of the sea with all the colors of life and living..) especially during feeding time with the scuba diver, and there is so much more!We only had a few hours to spend on a somewhat rainy (not really) Sunday, and it wasn't crowded at all.  There were plenty of kids (always wonderful), and I learned a lot.  I was actually amazed at how much I already knew!  I guess I'm more informed than I thought.  Always a good refresher to go to the aquarium.I hope to come back soon.  (Can we please, boy scout?  I want to see the jellies...)"
2783,2016-07-01,5,"Absolutely beautiful! Great place to see and learn about ocean life. The animals are well cared for and fascinating to watch. Very good and interesting educational programs in the auditorium. Start your day at the aquarium early because there is so much to see. Nice coffee bar and cafeteria...or you can get your hand stamped, enjoy lunch in the neighborhood, and return fully charged to see more. Awesome!"
2784,2012-01-29,5,"What can we say, this was such a great experience and something every person should come and see!It's unfortunate that my partner has been up in SF for 5 years and never been to the aquarium. So, I dragged him out to it!He loved the auditorium lectures, we caught them all. Favorite has to be Whales to Windmills and the shark one!It gets a bit crowded towards the afternoon, but in the early morning it's perfect! Parking is abundant and we found some for $10 bucks!Knowing that the money we paid to come in goes back into the entire program and research, it's a double win. We get to see stuff we'd never be able to and give back to understanding the ocean more.Monterey Bay Aquarium was a fabulous experience and I recommend to anyone to come!"
2785,2011-07-05,4,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is something you have to experiance at least once. The whole cannery row experiance is a fun one but the aquarium is the grand finale. If it weren't so pricey I think we'd go a lot more. They do a good job of keeping a nice flow so even when it's really crowded you can still see everything you want to look at. They also have lots of information availible about what you're seeing. If you time it right you can even go and see them inside the big tanks working with the sharks or feeding some of the bigger fish. The favorite for my kids is the room over by the penguines where you can touch some of the fish. It's worth the trip and the parking excursion to check this place out.
2786,2011-02-26,3,"When did the Monterey Bay Aquarium turn into a political rally?  Don't get me wrong, the exhibits are breathtaking. The jellyfish and seahorses are spectacular, the penguins, the deep tanks...wow.But it seemed that wherever I turned, I was faced with a message or kiosk or pamphleteer with literature about the greehouse effect or carbon footprints or global warming. The entire pink flamingo exhibit was a guilt trip about how we're destroying things.People can, and do, disagree about the hard science behind the aforementioned issues, me being one of them.  Why not focus solely on conservation and keep the political angles separate?  A little balance can go a loooooong way."
2787,2014-04-26,4,"My wife and I had a blast seeing all the exhibits and fishes.. Trying to find Nemo and his crew :-) overall it was amazing, our favorite being the jellyfish part. We just wish they had more sharks, giant crabs, unique fishes. We finished walking around the whole aquarium and reading 90% of all the info's along the exhibits within an hour and a half. We have a little kiddo on the way and the aquarium's play and nature areas seemed super cool - the families their were having an awesome time!"
2788,2014-02-18,4,"The $40 price tag for general admission is, in my opinion, pretty steep. However, it was well worth the experience as I've been trying to get here since I was 5 years old and finally went for my 35th birthday. I have been to Scripps Aquarium in San Diego as well as the Long Beach Aquarium. Neither compare with this place. It seems smaller than Scripps, but they have much better sea life. Scripps only has things like anenome's (sp?) and starfish in the touch pools. Monterey Bay has sea cucumbers and stuff like that. There is a whole Jelly Fishes experience. My favorite had to be the penguins and the talk on the Albatross. Thank you for a great time on Valentine's Day. Great day to go...not crowded and not empty."
2789,2011-10-03,4,"I love aquariums, the beach and sea life in general. This is awesome because it has all three. This aquarium is right on the water and has great veiws from the observation decks. This is a great place for anyone and everyone to come visit and have a good time. It is on cannery row, which is kinda touristy, but you can walk around and there are places to eat and shop for tourist type stuff. There is also an amazing path that runs along the coast that great for walking or riding a bike. I was super excited about seeing the ""great white shark"" but it was disappointing becasue it was a lot smaller than I expected. Tickets or like $30 for adults, which I think is too much and is why this place gets 4 stars instead of 5. I think they should lower the prices to encourage moe people to enjoy the beuaty of the ocean and learn about it."
2790,2011-02-26,5,"Met some friends here this week, and we had a wonderful time.  I love the sea otters, we got to watch the feeding, which is always fun.  The penguins are my favorites, and this time we had some friendly ones come right up to the glass and hang out with us for awhile.  Totally amazing.The kids had a fantastic time in the splash zone, and they enjoyed all of the different interactive exhibits throughout the aquarium, the touch tank, the game where you pretend to be a sea horse, the quiz about the penguins.  Now I just have to remember that it doesn't take that long to get there from here, and go more often."
2791,2014-02-16,4,"I absolutely love the aquarium ! Except for when it's SUPER busy & crowded. It gets really hot inside, and it definitely takes away the fun."
2792,2011-02-10,5,"Hands down my favorite aquarium ever! I used to come here a lot when I was little but not so much in the recent years. So last May I had to come here while I was in Monterey for Memorial Day weekend. It was a little busy because it was a holiday weekend but I still got to see everything pretty much. Jellyfish are my faves because they're absolutely beautiful. I love how their bright pinkness contrasts with the bright blue tank. So beautiful! I think I actually have a picture of them hanging on my wall. I also love the sea otters because they are oh-so-freaking-cute! And though I have been here many times, this was the first time I caught the feeding! So cute and I'm so glad I got to see it!Penguins! I never knew they had so many! They had a couple exhibits of them and I didn't remember them having that many when I was little. They're so cute!I'm also glad they still had the sea horses exhibit because I had wanted to see that before when I saw all the advertisements in SF but I hadn't had time to make it down there. Definitely glad I got to see it!I love walking around in here, there's so much to see that time passes by so quickly!"
2793,2011-08-10,5,We are older and we loved it. Lots of places to rest and watch the fish tanks. Even though it was a tad busy we saw everything and enjoyed seeing the children's reactions.The Jelly Fish and Seahorse exhibits were awesomeIt was our 3rd time there over the last 30 yrs. Just keeps getting better.
2794,2013-10-31,3,I think I picked a bad day to visit. I find it to be too crowded. There is a lot to see and a lot to learn but with so many people around I felt like I wanted to quickly finish looking around and get out. It was not as enjoyable as I hoped it to be because I love sealife. I got in and out within 2 hours. I felt like it was a bit pricy for 2 hours. I drove longer then the aquarium stay.  =(
2795,2011-01-25,5,"There are 949 (950 after mine) reviews for the Monterey Bay Aquarium and I'm not sure that I have anything else to add that hasn't already been said.  I do, however, have 2 questions for anyone who reads this ""review.""  1.  Did anyone else finish their visit of the aquarium with a overwhelming urge for sushi?  I know I did.2.  What's the deal with the conservationist propaganda!?  Gees.  I mean, I get it.  We wanna take care of the oceans blah blah blah.  But trying to guilt trip people into caring about the environment hardly seems effective.  In fact, it does the exact opposite for me.  Regardless, I will say that the Monterey Bay Aquarium is immaculately maintained and has some amazing exhibits.  It beats out the aquariums at Sea World any day of the week."
2796,2014-10-25,5,A wonderful exhibit. Worth traveling to. Plan on all day because there It's a lot to take in. The kids will remember it for sure.
2797,2011-01-25,5,"True Pisces here, loves long walks through pretty aquariums, stuffed marine animal toys on sale, and screaming with childlike enthusiasm as I capture another awesome photo on my phone.  Interested?Enter the Monterey Bay Aquarium through the eyes of a child and I promise you'll always enjoy yourself.  Shriek with genuine excitement at the jellyfish!  Awww with all your heart strings at the sea horses.  ""Look at the pelicans, Manny.""  Have pretend-convos with your best friends serving as the penguins.  Oooh and ahhh at the cute lil sea otters.  Make like one of the little brats running around and you'll find yourself joining in on their fun.Plus, as a kid you don't have to immerse yourself in that strangely omnipresent conservationist propaganda (TM Alex P.).  I know it's nice to know what's happening to our oceanic brethren, but I don't need it so much that it tries to hate fun.Don't eat here.  Go elsewhere.  Come oooon it's Monterey, you'll find a better (and cheaper!) alternative -- your handstamp and receipt allows you to re-enter the building anyway.  However, DO make a point of stopping by the gift shop.  I walked outta here with a LOAD of stuff that although I hadn't planned to purchase, I was super glad I did because their profits go directly back to the Aquarium!All single Scorpio or Cancer guys with a penchant for marine life and being the biggest kids on the block.....  call me!"
2798,2011-10-24,5,"First of all, be clever and park for FREE by parking local a few blocks up. It's a quick walk. And if you know someone who looks like you who has an aquarium pass, maybe you can save $30 ;)This is an amazing aquarium. I haven't been here for a long time, and they've done so much. The reconstructions are beautiful. Museum upkeep and cleanliness is still impeccable. I always love the jellyfish section- it's so dreamy and mesmerizing to watch. And now they have these awesome green sea turtles! We were there for a while and a worker came by the let us see behind the scenes; they brought us and several others hanging out in the turtle exhibit to the rooftop and showed us these 2 massive black turtles. Seemed like a rare tour, which made by day! Also, we saw the octopus as one the last exhibits and since it's a nocturnal animal, it was very lively, prancing all over the tank. Definitely bring a camera and your curiosity! We spent 3 hours there, but could've definitely used another hour!"
2799,2012-04-19,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is the most beautiful aquarium I have ever been too. The sheer amount of sea life that they have is fascinating in its own. If you can name it they have it. When we came, they had a beautiful Sea Horse exhibit with every type of sea horse imaginable as well as there life process.The aquarium is huge with an outside patio where you can view wild sea lions and otters swimming in the bay. There is also a good size child play area where the kids can expend there ""extra"" energy.If you every drive to San Francisco from SoCal or you just happen to be in the Monterey Bay area, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must!"
2800,2011-07-27,4,"Went to see the baby otter they rescued. The aquarium is really nice. Sometimes loud as kids go crazy in there. The aquarium is really doing alot to educate the public on our ocean residents. Dont miss the otters, penguins, flamingos, sea horses, jellies...heck dont miss any of it. I ONLY WISH THAT VISITORS WOULD READ THE SIGNS! NO FLASH PICTURES. THESE ARE SENSITIVE SEA CREATURES AND FLASH CAN EITHER SCARE THEM OR HARM THEM! Really people....follow the rules! These creatures are in the depths of the ocean where light is limited. YOUR FLASH IS NOT WELCOME!  Do what I do...buy a post card...cant get a better picture than that. I also blame the aquarium for not enforcing this rule better than they do."
2801,2014-03-12,5,"Absolutely love this place. I was here about ten years ago and decided to revisit. Glad that I did. You can tell they take a lot of pride in everything they do. The food is also very good without being overpriced like you tend to see at most attractions. The ""Behind the Scenes Tour"" was definitely worth it as well!! This is my favorite aquarium in the country."
2802,2013-08-19,5,"I've been to many aquariums, but not all of them have glow in the dark, black lit tanks that stand a couple of stories tall. This is my all time favorite aquarium ever. Great for kids, you can actually spend an entire day at this aquarium and there's plenty of good eats within a walk."
2803,2014-08-15,5,"This place is a non profit organization which kind of explains why the price is HIGH, but WORTH it. I would highly suggest to go here on Wednesdays or Thursdays, this is the best time to go because it is less people. also,the earlier the BETTER. Upon entering, they will give you a brochure of shows and feeding time. etc.  there is a lot to see here,. we estimated to be here for just 2 hours because we wanted to explore other parts of Monterey Bay. but we ended up staying for 7 hours. lol also if you get hungry you can leave the aquarium and go eat at the cannery row in which they have amazing food. just remember to get a stamp on the hand for recognition for re entry."
2804,2013-03-31,3,"A great aquarium, but very pricey, especially given how overcrowded it is.  At one point, we found ourselves in such a frightening sea of people that we wondered how that number of bodies in a single space could possibly be in compliance with fire code.I would be happier paying that kind of money to enter if they simply limited the number of people allowed in at once.  We sometimes waited minutes to get close enough to the glass to see anything inside the exhibit.  This was a big waste of our time, and really hard to do with our toddler, who was overstimulated by all the people and who really didn't have the patience to stand and wait in line to see every single window in every exhibit.  Most young kids have a time limit before they will melt down and the experience at the Monterey aquarium is so inefficient that parents are left without options for creating a great experience for their kids."
2805,2014-02-02,5,"I thought this town was for couples only, but as a single guy I thought ""hmm where can I go?"" BINGO. Right next to the grand Pacific Ocean... Monterey Bay Aquarium. Well the only time I visited here was when I was sneaking out from my home and ditching class to come here. And the movie Seven Pounds kinda convinced me to visit this place because they got the deadliest jelly fish. Other than that, it smells fishy in there so beware :D"
2806,2011-04-19,5,"Amazing how some of these clowns give the Aquarium minus stars because they try to educate you on the trouble our oceans face. Good for the Monterey Bay Aquarium for trying to educate people on how we could better treat the ocean and all that live in it and off of it! And ""NO"" they don't bombard you with it! If you don't want to listen or see any of it, just move on! Better yet go to your local zoo and throw bananas at the monkeys! Anyway, I had a fun time at the Aquarium this past weekend. It was a nice experience that I will definitely do again. The big aquarium is closed do to damage done by the sea turtles. But still plenty to see and do...."
2807,2016-06-20,4,Great place for the entire family.  Great exhibits and show... watched the feedings.  Easy place to spend several hours.  Loved the jellyfish.
2808,2009-07-18,5,"Amazing! This is one of my favorite places in the whole world! The underwater exhibits are so peaceful. I can spend the whole day there! During my recent visit it was unexpectedly crowded! If you can, call ahead to check but otherwise I had a great time. Well worth the $30. If I lived closer to Monterey, I would definitely consider getting the membership."
2809,2015-10-17,1,This is completely a ripoff at $40 per adult.   Most of the exhibits remain the same after 30 years.  It's really ashame that a learning aquatic marine institution prevents many folks from being allowed money wise to easily see what the HP family intended to give back to the public.  Shame on the director and individuals making administrative decisions like this.  I can understand a need to collect some kind of money.  So a10 or 20 dollar admission is more suitable for this kind a venue.  Don't burden poor folks with irresponsible and immorale consequences like this.
2810,2011-05-04,4,"It's been more than 10 years since I've been to this place, but it's still a pretty cool place. Though a lot smaller than I remembered, there are many exhibits and sea creatures to stop and stare at. Personally, I liked the flamingos and penguins the best. There were plenty of them and all were pretty active.It can be quite crowded at times due to visitors, field trips, and families. However, if you want to look at different creatures of the sea, it's definitely a cool spot to check out."
2811,2013-06-07,5,"what can i say? i love this place. my fiance and i wanted to get married here, but unfortunately they don't do weddings in the summer due to their scheduled events. so sad. i know a lot of people say tickets are pricey and it kind of is, but here is how i justify it. my fiance and i come to the aquarium at least 3 times a year (we live the bay area), so we buy a membership. my student membership is $50, which is a DEAL if you are visiting the aquarium more than once. even the regular membership is $70 which is a deal if you go more than twice in a year. but honestly, i don't mind paying because the money goes to a place that is working on improving our world through education, research, and encouraging sustainable living. if you have the money to spend, i don't see a downside to spending it in this way.oh, and be sure to catch the seahorse exhibit before it gets taken down in the fall of 2013. rumor has it that it is going to be replaced with a cephalopod exhibit *squeals in delight* :D"
2812,2011-07-31,5,"I've been here a few times but more recently, last weekend. We had won free tickets for two adults and two kids from the Mushroom Festival in Morgan Hill!! Plus one star for getting in for free!!This place is jammed packed! There are all types of tourists here! Everyone is crowded in one area and it gets a little frustrating trying to look at something.I love how they have open areas outside for you to just enjoy the outdoors with a view of the ocean. The view of the seaweed in the water is not too pretty, but you can just overlook that! There are three levels of balconies outside if you just wanna stay out there for a while and get some fresh air. They also have telescopes for you to look through for seals, sea otters, and such in the ocean!I love it here! I would definitely keep coming here annually or at least every two years. You get to see what you normally can't see and it's amazing! It's always good to keep refreshing your memory and reminding yourself what is out there in the deep blue sea! I loved the sea horses!!! But what I loved most, (besides the pretty colorful tank with all the bright colored fishes) was the Kelp Forest! Its amazing how the school bus of fishes kept going in circles and circles and it a cycle that never ends! Loves it! Just amazing!!! Oh I must not forget!!! I FELL IN LOVE with MOON JELLY FISH!!! I think these had to be my favorite! They are so beautiful! They are white and flutters open and close..love them!!! They have the huge OCEAN TANK  view with the HUGE SUN FISH...That was amazing! Everyone was taking pictures of that thing! It's crazy how huge everything is and how small humans really are! I enjoyed it here a lot and when I have kids, I'm definitely visiting at least every other year!"
2813,2013-10-20,5,Love this place not just for me but the kids :) people that work here are always so chipper and that's a plus spent the weekend here not to far and spent Saturday and Sunday here
2814,2013-03-25,5,Love coming here with the family and sometimes just me myself and I! This is where he kids and I always escape even if it's just to walk around and enjoy the scenery. We don't have to spend a lot of money to enjoy this place.
2815,2014-07-27,5,We have been members and coming to visit for a very long time and I always look forward to the exhibits and just walking around the area.  Great place for people of any age.
2816,2013-08-30,2,"Don't recall enjoying this place even as a kid, and still don't. A friend and I decide to come check it out(first timer for my friend) so we got there and parking was just bad. We got inside only to find out it was $35 per person to get in, but went ahead and bought two tickets since we were already there. It was a complete waste of time only lasted around an hour in that place before we left of boredom! Nothing fun to see or do there, my guess being that it's more enjoyable for kids to visit. Don't plan on coming back here anytime soon."
2817,2013-10-06,5,This place is soo cool. I loved the large shark tank and watching all the creatures feed during feeding time. The place is very clean and it is on Cannery Row.
2818,2014-07-22,5,"My husband, 4 kids and I went to this aquarium and loved it. I haven't been to many aquariums, but I was entertained as were my kids. I loved how they had modernized most of the exhibits, it just felt fresh and upbeat with music. They had tons of fun and educational things for our kids to try (our kids age range is 6 yrs-15 yrs) The highlights were the jelly fish exhibit and the sea otters. Loved watching the sea otters play and swim around. Overall a beautiful aquarium with lots to see and learn. Great for families."
2819,2011-09-26,5,"Ooh, jellyfish! Ooh, octopus! Ooh, seahorses! OMG, OTTERS!!!!!!!On an epic road trip from Arizona to Washington, we decided to drive up the coast and stop for a couple nights in Monterey, California. Beautiful area...I had a hard time leaving...I had an even more challenging time leaving this aquarium. The kids on their various field trips had NOTHING on me and my pointing and oooohhhing and running around like it's Christmas morning. I was enamored by all of the exhibits, and I could not believe just how beautiful the actual building is. Some day, I would love to take my kids here, but until they exist, I'll keep visiting on my own thankyouverymuch."
2820,2014-01-09,5,"My favorite aquarium! I love the Jellyfish Experience and also petting the Stingrays! I have been to the Seattle and San Francisco aquarium too, but those don't even compare."
2821,2011-07-28,5,"I grew up visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium and I only have good memories of this place.  I LOVE Monterey to begin with, and we don't always come to the Aquarium on every visit.  This particular visit was special though, since it was the first time we took our daughter.We visited on a Monday and arrived at about 11am.  We parked in a garage a couple of blocks from Cannery Row and walked to the Aquarium.  The entrance fee is a bit on the pricey side- $29.99 for adults, but I had a $2 off coupon.  Hey, $2 is $2!!  Kids up to age 3 are free.  It wasn't too crowded.  Mostly tourists.  School was out for the summer, so no field trips.  I probably ran over a few people with the stroller on accident, but hey, it happens!Our daughter was 8 months at the time of our visit.  This was a perfect age to take her.  She was infatuated with the huge windows filled with water and fish and jellyfish.  She waved to anything that swam in front of her.  The penguins kept her entertained as well, but definitely not as much as the fish.  It was great that around every corner we turned, there was a huge window filled with fish and other sorts of sea creatures.There are secured kiddie areas scattered around the Aquarium, so that the kids could play within an enclosed space and the parents could take a load off while keeping an eye on their kids.  We found a little baby/toddler area that was set aside and it was meant just for babies/toddlers.  This was perfect because our daughter needed to stretch out and get the blood circulating in her legs, not to mention our backs and arms needed a break from carrying her (we had our stroller, but carrying her was the best way that she could see everything).  We had the area to ourselves, which was nice.  They have added flamingos and turtles to their exhibits, which I don't ever remember seeing before.  That was a nice change.  And there were designated feeding times and demonstrations scheduled throughout the day in case people were interested in learning more.Everything here was clean.  The restrooms were big and clean, with more than enough room to change a baby's diaper if needed.  In the women's restrooms, there was a separate area with a changing table built into the countertop, with plenty of paper liners and a separate trash bin for diapers.  There was also a chair in case you wanted to nurse in there, or just sit down.  In addition, there was also the drop down changing table attached to the wall, so if one area was taken, you could use another.  The employees were very helpful and nice.  There was a good variety of gifts to choose from in each gift shop.  We will definitely be back to visit the fish and otters and jellyfish and sharks, among other things!  It'll be one tradition we will keep going in the family!"
2822,2011-01-27,4,"You're right. All of you. I loved spending my day here!

2823,2014-01-07,4,"I have heard every aquarium boast that they are the best in the world.  This one does not have to.  It is set in an old canery factory that boasts great exibits.  Jelly fish is currently going on and I throughly enjoyed it.  What I thought was the best part of the aquarium is how they incorporate the entire Bay into the experience and encourage you to kayak, dive, or even take a whale watching tour.  It is a beautiful place in a beautiful area."
2824,2011-03-27,5,"Monterey Bay Aqaurium is definitely one of the places to consider for a mini-family trip. I don't recall coming here as a kid, but my recent visit makes up for it!I'm a young adult now...but I'm really still a kid at heart. My parents have been working really hard (and so have I) and we occasionally have an all-day family trip. My uncle used to bring everyone together to Disneyland, Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, etc.. but it's just really difficult now that the children in the family have all grown up and are attending different colleges. So, my mom wanted to keep the tradition alive, so that was what brought my bros, parents, and I to the aqaurium. I gotta admit..I was a bit hesitant at first and was afraid I wouldn't fit into the scene. But, my fears melt away immediately as soon as I saw JELLYFISH!!LOL, I still like Spongebob Squarepants a lot (you can quiz me on anything from any episodes, and I'll be able to answer) and seeing all the different types of jelly fishy just got me excited! The Moonlight?? (shame on me for not remembering the name) species was the prettiest! Don't miss out on this!I enjoyed looking at the seahorses, otters, and tropical fishes too, but for some reason, the jelly fishes brought back good memories. Spongebob's favorite hobby is jelly-fishing! yeah!My bro was busy taking pics with his dslr while my dad couldn't take his eyes off the sharks. Haha, my dad's been into mountain lions and sharks lately. Tickets were pricey but if you're a student, you'll get a $2.00 discount =) They didn't even ask for my ""old"" student ID.Will come back when I start my own family many years from now."
2825,2013-06-05,3,"Hmmmm.. $40 admission seems a little overpriced for what you see. The jellyfish exhibits were super cool though and if i would have had all day i would have sat in this dark roomed exhibit the whole time, such fascinating little creatures. The giant octopus exhibit was also really really cool. The female was all over the place slinking her way from one end of the glass to the other, such beautiful movements. Other than that the rest of the aquarium seemed like all the others i have been to in various places across the states. But i am assuming the admission price goes towards sea life awareness based off all the signage and pamphlets around, so thats a worthwhile use of the funds."
2826,2011-03-28,5,".., it's an oceanic orgasm. Gorgeous inside & out. It's always great to visit Northern California whenever we get the chance. So many exhibits, info, activities, & sea life. It's amazing to take a look around & wonder where they started off making this incredible aquarium. Great for families & friends. You can catch the view of the ocean outside from various spots also. They have a great variety of fishes, sharks, rays, & everything else. This place is a must in my book!"
2827,2011-11-16,5,"Beautiful aquarium that protect and research aquatic life.  I loved the exhibits and I loved the message that is promoted with each inspiring quote and education exhibit.  I also like the seafood watch pamphlets.The tanks are deep, large and vast.  It's kinda ethereal and creepy at the same time, watching the serene deep blue of the tank and a fish coasting along when a shark comes out of the blue.  Sharks, fish, jellyfish, seastars, sea horses, otters, penguins, they are all here.  I very much enjoyed the volunteers that educate on the exhibits, very nice and interesting information.  Did you know that an octopus' blood is based on copper and that is why it is green?  Perfect place to visit with your kids, family, friends, and romantic for the significant others."
2828,2011-10-24,5,"came here yesterday, last time prior to that was 9 years ago...i remember this place being a lot bigger, but i was also a lot younger thenthe deep ocean exhibit and kelp forest is mesmerizing, hynotizing, beautiful, and all the other adjectives you'd use to describe awesomeness. 27 bucks for student entrance, 29 for regular...you can spend about 2 hours here, more if you actually take time to admire all the exhibits and read their descriptions"
2829,2013-08-03,4,"Just because we really love animals and get excited every time, but the aquarium could definitely use some reorganization."
2830,2011-02-21,5,"What I really enjoyed were the interactive displays for children. It had many touch pool stations and fun activities for kids to get involved about learning about sea life and its impact on the environment. What I never really liked about other museums were that their displays were inaccessible to kids, so you'd drag them along while they stared at figurines while not really absorbing the impact of it. One could say the aquarium 'dumbed down' the information, I'd say that it made it more fun for kids (and adults!) to want to learn about, for example, what kinds of sea life we should eat/avoid consuming and the reasons behind them (over harvesting, health effects, etc). The displays were beautiful and clean, and you can tell by the plump penguins that these animals, unlike the ones in the SF Zoo, were being well taken care of. I'd come here again!"
2831,2011-01-02,1,"$29.95 for an adult ticket and we were in and out in 90 minutes.  Not worth it.Looks like a great place for families, but not for adults w/o kids.   Not designed to accomodate large crowds of viewers as the glass exhibits are on the smaller side.After the seahorse and jellyfish exhibits we were bored.  Especially since one of the wings was full of murals and propoganda.  There was an actual poster asking people to be vegetarians since its better for the planet.  Seriously??  At an aquarium exhibit??  I don't mind hearing opinions, but I considered much of it indoctrination.We went earlier in the morning so we parked on the street for $4.  I would have been upset if we had paid $10 for parking on top of the admission.Make the trip to the Oregon Coast Aquarium instead!"
2832,2014-09-06,3,"Went to the aquarium after hearing rave reviews here on Yelp and from a friend. As a big fan of marine life and regular at a few aquariums back home in CT (Maritime Aquarium and Mystic Aquarium) I thought I would check it out. Overall, a cool aquarium but I feel like they need to have more unique species of fish - I agree with some other reviews that many of the fish are unremarkable and common even in home aquariums. The BIGGEST criticism I have is the severe overcrowded exhibits and hundreds of little kids running into me and stroller brigades but hey, it is an aquarium and the whole family should be welcome. Also, since there are so many people, everyone has their phones and cameras out right on the glass and use their flash!!! Hard to fully experience the exhibits. Overall, cool aquarium with some interesting marine life (Open Sea tank is awesome with dolphinfish, striped bass, sturgeon, tuna, turtles and sharks!) but overcrowded and touristy."
2833,2009-04-24,5,This is my second visit.Today's visit was very busy but so much fun! The exhibits are beautiful. $30.00 per adult. They have a great Jelly fish collection and the beginnings of a great sea horse display. The sea otters are too cute and the children there today looked like they were having fun! The place is huge! Well worth the tripbetter than my last visit years ago!
2834,2011-07-13,5,"HEY that is the best that is available withing driving distance from bay area. We loved it, our little one (14 months at the moment) had a BLAST over at kids village. one note though, have some extra dry clothes if your little one has some extra interest in playing with water. I dried ours in man's restroom by the air dryer, option to consider.Over all: clean, well taken care off, TON of activities and stuff to see for grown ups and kids.We LOVED !"
2835,2011-03-22,5,"I love the aquarium and the people who work there but not necessarily the people who visit here. Overall, it is a great experience and very much worth a trip to Monterey to see. Some survival tips:-Seek out people who work there who hang out near exhibits. They are very informative and helpful. They'll make your visit awesome, including letting you in on when certain areas are less crowded. -Don't be afraid to take a breather outside or get your hand stamped so that you can leave for lunch and come back. On a busy day, it is easy to get overloaded by crowds and noise.-BEWARE the tour groups that are not affiliated directly with the aquarium... such as school groups. If you see one adult and a bunch of kids wearing the same colored shirt, you might want to walk in the other direction. We would wait in line to see a tank, only to step up and 2 seconds later have some tour guide scream directly into my ear, ""EXCUSE ME!!!"" and then proceed to push myself and my two kids aside only to have a rush of about 20 or more students run at the tank. This happened at multiple exhibits and was super rude/annoying.Parking Tip: -If you can find it... there is a multiple story parking garage, near the aquarium, that charges $18 for the day but across the street, there is a small public pay lot that is only $8 a day. If you can find a spot, that is a great money saver."
2836,2012-02-27,5,"[This review was written in August 2010 but is still true today!]Yeah, it's crowded, so what? Get over yourself! OK, got that out of the way.... :)The Monterey Bay Aquarium, although stiff pricing, may be worth it for you and your family to check out. There was so much to see and do, I could not possibly write it all down, so here's my oh so brief summary of my three hour tour (add Gilligan's Theme). When you first walk (after the sticker shock of $29.95 a ticket! I had my work discount) in, you see the huge dolphin and whale displays on the ceiling like very large aqua piñatas. There were several areas of interest I wanted to check including the Seahorse exhibits but there was so much more. The huge tidal wave pool is tremendous. You can even be inside a glass/plastic bubble and watch as it roars overhead. Beats the Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park for sure. The giant jellyfish, all colored red and white, float by. It was tough taking photos of all this with the darkness but do try. And they don't allow flash photography since it could harm the animals. Anyway, the tanks are huge. Big enough for manta rays and mean-looking sharks. There is a penguin pool and otters. I wanted to see the birth of Seahorses and they have a video to prove it. I did not know of the several varieties of seahorses including one who blends right in with seaweed - a Dragon Seahorse. Very cool. There were plenty of families and children on a Friday morning. I would hate to be here on Saturday, as crowded as Friday was. There were also birds in an estuary environment which was fascinating. There are also areas where kids can touch seashells and live starfish. They have a similar set-up at the Seattle Aquarium too, where I also have visited. And like the Seattle Aquarium, Monterey Bay Aquarium has hands-on exhibits, tanks filled with large fish and frogs, and what was most amazing to me, the kelp forest with its many silver fish as they schooled together and flowed around. The amazingly beautiful aquarium is a great place to be. Highly recommended, especially for kids & families."
2837,2014-05-12,5,I brought my daughter who is just under 2.  I was not sure if she would like it cause she is very little but we ended up spending most of the day there.  She really liked touching all of the stuff in the tide pools and they have a children's area upstairs that she loved.  I would recommend bringing kids in the afternoon.  It was allot less crowded in the afternoon.
2838,2013-02-25,4,"I love all things animal - so on a quest to visit every zoo in the entire world (it'll happen, don't worry), I of course had to venture down to one of the largest aquariums in the world.I'd say it lived up to the hype.  We got there at 9:55 on a Friday...just in time to get in line before the 10:00 opening AND beat the line out the door that formed shortly after.  A Friday means not as many tourists - but much more field trips.They've got you running around from opening till close.  There are feedings for all the large areas - reef, penguins, sharks, etc. and each last about a half hour because they answer questions and explain what's going on.  A lot of the people that run the outside of the feedings (as in not the scuba divers or penguin experts) are volunteers but you can tell they love it there.  They're very patient with the odd/awkward questions, and they're really good at coming up with follow up questions that lead the presenter to give you more information.  There are also video screenings and slide show type presentations - plenty to keep you busy.On a nice day, the back porch is great for taking a break, watching the boats sail in, and possibly spotting some dolphins and sea otters out in the bay.They currently have a seahorse exhibit and jellyfish exhibit - two of my favorite animals.  But unfortunately, the sea otter exhibit is out of commission for remodeling. :-(  And the aviary is a very fun place to watch recovering birds hang out.Definitely worth a visit - even with the $35 entry ticket (and not many discounts in sight!)"
2839,2011-07-09,5,Visited from Hawaii.Otters -- so adorable!  Sun fish -- awesome.  Jellyfish exhibit -- perfect lighting to bring out the jellies.  Kid's area -- scary and noisy.Just go there.  Experience it.
2840,2014-06-30,3,for me it was OK. i saw really great reviews on yelp but its not up to that.first good points 1. employees were very helpfull and informative. 2. you can enjoy open sea and exhibit both at one place. 3. exhibits were mainted really well and tours were informative.but what i didn't like 1. they are not having any big exhibit like sharks. May be i was having big expectations.  2. second not enough space for strollers. it is messy when there are 2 3 strollers at same time.  3. another bigger issue for us was parking near to aquarium
2841,2011-05-29,5,"Keep in mind that we visited the aquarium during Memorial Day Weekend.This is my 4th visit to the aquarium over the span of 15 years.  My parents took me here when I was in high school and since then I""ve been back on 3 different occasions.  If you don't have kids and don't like crowds, don't go during a 3-day weekend and try to avoid 12noon-2pm on a Saturday.  I think the aquarium hit its peak hours around that time on a Saturday as that is when all the visitors who drove down from the Bay Area or nearby.  The aquarium is definitely one of the nicest and they are constantly updating their exhibits (which is why, after 4 visits, I still make regular returns).  At the time of this review, they had reintroduced their Jellyfish exhibit (which was OK), but I highly recommend the seahorse exhibit.One other tip: I usually avoid museum restaurants/cafes.  The grill in the museum cafeteria serves up a decent burger made with Niman Ranch beef."
2842,2011-04-03,4,"I went today and I was sooo bummed that they closed the exhibit of the huge tank where people can see different kinds of fishes and sharks, like the sunfish! That exhibit won't open till June 2011 I believe. Definitely had an assortment of animals to see. Saw the sea otters, penguins, sea horses, jellyfishes and the other animals in the kelp forest area. I saw the kelp forest at the time the diver went in to feed the fishes. I could only see a part of it as there were plenty of people surrounding the windows to watch it. I am a huge fan of aquariums so it is very difficult for me to give this place less than 4 stars. I will admit, the aquarium does get crowded with LOTS of parents and their children who would at times shove through hordes of people so that they will be in the front to see the display of aquarium animals. The aquarium does cater quite a bit to children I say 8 years and below since they have plenty of interactive things. This place is very educational, and at times they do have some eco-propaganda. It would be nice if they could replace this stuff with more exhibits. And I paid about $27 - $28 for the student ticket, and they closed what I felt was one of the aquarium's main attractions (and my favorite too)! I wouldn't have mind sitting there for 30 minutes to 1 hour watching fishes peacefully swim around. A discount would have been nice."
2843,2011-11-07,4,"Just about worth the admission price which is a little on the high side.One of the main detractions is parking which can be hard to find on busier days. And then if you do, the lots they recommend are $15!! That's pricey as well.It's one of the best aquariums I've been to. Plenty of interesting displays that capture the imagination.The show we caught about sharks was informative and fun, albeit a little on the short side.It can get extremely busy so be prepared to wait at some of the busier exhibits, otters are popular.There's an opportunity to touch and feel the different types of water based creatures.The exhibits are also tastefully laid out and the array of colors on display add to the ""wow"" factor.This is a great place to take kids who are sure to be amused and captivated.I'd say half a day would give you ample to time to check out all the exhibits, see a show and get a good feel about the place."
2844,2012-02-21,5,"I have been here a few times as I was a kid and remembered why I loved this place. Great exhibits filled with marine animals found all over the world. Although the admission was pricy, I learned that my $ when to the care for the animals that I was there for so I felt better after for paying $30 a pop. This place is great for kids because of all the interactive activities that teach kids about marine life. But there is also a lot of amazing things for adults as well. Best part was the circle sardine tank that encircles the visitors once you enter one of the exhibits. You will see what I am talking about once you see for yourself. Go check it out!"
2845,2014-02-19,3,"As a 30 year old I think I may be getting too old for aquariums. I've gone here a number of times and I don't think they have done much updating to the place in awhile. Everything seemed the same. If it's your first time going here then you may enjoy it. I only enjoyed the otters (that I could see through the crowds), the penguins, and the jellies. Kids will love this place."
2846,2014-08-25,4,Such a fun stop on the summer road trip my husband and I took up the coast! An amazing aquarium I was in heaven! The octopus and jellyfish exhibits were so rad! My favorite part about the place was the huge open ocean exhibit. Made us feel like we were gazing into the ocean!! One thing that was kind of a bummer was the otter exhibit so crowded the whole time we were there we kept going back to check if the crowd dyed down but we only got small glimpses of some otters. Wish there was more room because my husband lovessss otters!!!! But overall awesome experience!
2847,2013-07-28,3,"I liked everything I saw, but I was disappointed that I could not access the entire Aquarium after I bought a ticket...its like I had to buy multiple tickets to see everything.  this wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so expensive to go to!  Also, parking is a real problem.  I've seen other aquariums in the USA and over-all I'd say this one was a bit below the others."
2848,2014-08-24,5,"Visited Monterey Bay Aquarium on Friday, 8/15, with my nephew.  I purchased our tickets and behind-the-scene tours passes 4 months earlier and was very grateful for the pre-planning. The behind the scenes shark tour began at 9AM, an hour before the aquarium opens to the general public:  that alone was more than worth the price of admission -- no crowds, an informative tour guide and wide open spaces to view everything up close.  The behind the scenes 11AM Jellies tour was a highlight of our day -- our tour guide was delightful, very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and did a great job explaining the various aspects of Jellies' diet, reproduction and the care taken by MBA to keep the Jellies healthy in their environment.  (One more thing to note that I appreciated about the tours ... the tour guide is mic'd and each person on the tour wears a small headset to clearly hear everything the tour guide is saying in the public areas of the aquarium where the crowd noise would otherwise make it very difficult to do so. Nice touch and smart move, Monterey Bay Aquarium!) Lunch at the aquarium's cafe was crowded, but the line for food moved quickly and we found an open table quickly as well.  The food was very good, a bit pricey as expected.  The behind the scenes aquarium tour was next up -- also very informative and provided a lot of relevant, interesting background information on the original historic cannery and how it would rise from abandoned ruins to become the MBA.  Every MBA volunteer and staff member we encountered was professional, friendly, informative; it was very obvious they enjoy what they do and take pride in their work.  The aquarium property itself was very clean and well maintained.  By early afternoon we were done with the tours and gift shoppe purchases and I was grateful we were leaving because the place was getting quite crowded.  Pack your patience if you plan on visiting the aquarium midday to afternoon -- but, if you plan your trip early, purchase your tickets online -- and ideally book some of the behind the scenes tours (that get you away from the crowds and noise), you will thoroughly enjoy your MBA experience.  We did."
2849,2011-10-04,5,Great place!
2850,2011-08-09,5,"I've been coming to the aquarium since I was tiny. SO MANY good memories here! It's ridiculously fun to bring my little one here now that I'm all ( well, kinda ) grown up. The jellyfish exhibit is always cool, the open sea exhibit is always cool... OK, you got me. I pretty much geek out on the entire aquarium. Especially awesome? The ""Coral Babies"" play area. My daughter is only one, so most of the aquarium trip is really for mommy, but this area is designed for the Under 2 set. A water area with rubber fish, a texture area and a giant water bed that is supposed to simulate waves when you put your little one on it - so cool! She played and played and played and still didn't want to leave. I wish we lived closer - it would be worth getting a membership just to bring her to play! On the less Sesame-Street-Crowd level, they have so much for adults too. It doesn't matter how many times I see the Wolf Eel & Sun Fish, they blow my mind every time. Also, if you're a bio/science/Steinbeck enthusiast/etc geek, don't miss the exhibit on ""Doc"" Ed Ricketts near the entrance. Small but well executed display of specimens he caught and a short history of his ecological & literary contributions."
2851,2014-08-22,5,"I could stay in this aquariam for hours. It is an amazing and beautiful place to bring people of all ages. The animals are treated like they should be if not better and it's so fun to see them up close. They also have an area where you can touch some of the animals. I think like sea urchins sea stars, etc. Love this place. Also has a great view of the ocean and you can see little sea otters sometimes"
2852,2014-08-21,4,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium and have been coming here since I was a young girl. My favorite exhibit is the current jelly exhibit which has a 60's feel. The animals are majestical and I could spend hours looking at the sunfish, turtles and sharks in the largest tank. There was a crazy amount of people at the aquarium, which I thought would die down since school had started, and this made it a little hard to enjoy the exhibits but there was still places to escape. But overall it was really nice my dad was very excited to come here so we enjoyed our time."
2853,2016-04-25,5,We only had 2 hours but were able to make the most of it. The exhibits of the jelly fish and octopi were fantastic. The Open Sea and Kelp Forest exhibits were incredible as well. Don't miss the touch pools near the Aviary! Wonderful experience. Hope to come back sometime for a lengthier visit.
2854,2011-07-07,4,"I will keep this as brief as possible, but this aquarium is state of the art.  Location being right on the water, the newer wings,   This is very child friendly.  The best attractions are the sea otters, the touch tanks (for the kids), and the open sea exhibit (check out the sunfish).Things I don't care for - the crowds, prices in the cafe.  Although I realize that this a worldwide tourist attraction, I should expect these two negatives.The ticket prices were not horrible like theme parks.  I bought a two day adult pass for ~$30 and a child for ~$20.This was my child's first trip there and far from my first.  We will be returning for this beautiful experience again."
2855,2014-01-08,4,"I'm glad I experienced it, I have to be honest, it's big but not as big as I thought it would be. I loved the jellies experience exhibit! My bf, being a big history buff, enjoyed the exhibit on Monterey's sardine industry. I was a bit disappointed that the tours available were not included, especially with the price you're already paying for admission. If they included them with the membership price that would be fine but not even that, only a few dollars discount. Glad I can say I've been."
2856,2011-06-15,5,"I've definitely never been here until this weekend, and I'm glad I went!  First time here - and I LOVED IT.  :)I'm a science teacher, and I definitely nerded out a bit at the aquarium.  We paid $28 (student discount w/ ID) for the ticket, and it was definitely worth every dollar.  It took me about 2-3 hours to look at everything, and about another hour to go back and re-visit a few of the exhibits.  Saw the sea otters, jellyfish, birds, fish, and other sea life.  I LOVED the jellyfish exhibit!  Check it out when you're at the aquarium.To the people who got bored - HOW?  There's definitely no way you can become bored - there's so much to see and learn!  I suppose this goes back to my love for science, but it definitely got me thinking about food chains and evolution :)I went on a weekday, so it probably wasn't nearly as crowded as it would have been on the weekend.  It was crowded enough for my tastes.  Don't think I could ever handle MORE kids running around, although I did see a young girl talk to her mom about the seahorses.  Glad to see that she was so interested in it at such a young age! TL;DR - An amazing place.  You're never too old to learn!"
2857,2012-06-14,5,"It's awesome for all ages!Go here- it's informative, entertaining, and you'll spend hours here. What more could you want? I love touching the bat rays- I'm just as entertained at the age of 30 as I was at the age of 10."
2858,2011-08-07,5,Best aquarium I have been to.  The exhibits are great and amazing and you always leave learning something new!
2859,2013-07-17,3,"I have been to a number of aquariums in my time and had heard that this was one to make sure and visit.  Although it did have some great features and some exhibits that I have not seen at other aquariums... I have to say I was fairly disappointed.  My recommendation, if you are local and don't want to travel far to an aquarium to see the exhibits, by all means visit here.  However if you are travelling from far away to see an aquarium I would say take the time to do your research and compare other aquariums for the price.  Personally I and my family have had a far better experience at the aquarium of the pacific in Long Beach, CA and would recommend a visit to this one (there are also more surrounding attractions you can visit compared to this aquarium).  So ultimately my vote is... good but not great."
2860,2015-07-05,5,"this place is worth the overpriced hotels and poorly run breakfast shops: World class environmental and zoological facility! blows my mind if anyone would give less than five stars. take the behind the scenes tour is as well, well worth it."
2861,2012-06-10,4,"This place is amazing, lots of different environments. Some of the visitors are as crazy-looking as some of the fish and sea animals. We went in the afternoon to avoid the morning rush from school groups - it was full but not over-full. But the price ($35 per adult) is just crazy. Yes, it's good, but even without the expensive parking in the area, it's more than we would have liked to pay for the experience."
2862,2015-05-26,2,"Nice but very expensive, there is no place to park! I have spent a lot of time to find a place.  I come from Europe and I have seen wonderful aquariums less expensive and with parking!"
2863,2011-09-21,4,It's was great. Too many people there but had a lot to look at.
2864,2014-03-10,5,"Checked this place out, parking can be difficult but if u valet your car there ain't really a problem. It was my first time here entry line was pretty quick  checked out the otters for the first exhibit checked out really cool how most exhibits here are made here as it's multiple exhibits in one and many are 2 stories as far as the large exhibits go. The workers here was extremely nice. My fav exhibit gotta be the jellys as the hallways are darken enough for the jellys colors to just pop at you. Gift shops they have multiple everywhere u go. But this is the fist for me as they have a places to eat also In the aquarium as in a deli and restraunt didn't get to try them but food did look go tho and were decently priced."
2865,2014-02-03,5,"I've visited this aquarium several times and it NEVER bores.  On our stay this past weekend, we were able to watch a large pod of dolphins swimming in the bay from the aquarium's outdoor deck.  Absolutely amazing sight to see!"
2866,2016-05-20,5,"I haven't been here for s very long time. We visited without kids, and had a fun time. Here on a weekday so very busy, but not overcrowded. Interesting story about the Packards."
2867,2015-08-25,3,It's a pretty good spot.  Much better than the one in san fran which you should probably skip.
2868,2010-12-27,5,"There is no better aquarium in the world than this one. It is worth every penny spent on admission. We have been here dozens of times throughout my lifetime, but out most recent visit has brought my appreciation to a new level. I have a 19 month old daughter who had an immense appreciation for so many of the little things throughout. From the large tanks with huge sharks to the new kelp exhibit. She found every single tiny tank with every single tiny creature far better than I would have ever imagined. The kids area with the tide pool demonstration where kids could get their hands (and arms and clothes) wet and the toddler area where she could do a water-bed type demonstration was so well designed and managed. She loved every second spent there and we loved it even more seeing all the joy and happiness that our trip there had brought her. In one word: amazing. Here's another tip: I'm a teacher and religiously bring all my 60-ish 6th graders here. Why? Because it's the greatest aquarium ever, but also because they do FREE field trips... like, for ALL school groups! And, they'll do labs and all kinds of presentations for the kids if you apply early enough in the season (May-ish). It's the best! What an amazing organization to put education at the forefront of their priorities! We will most certainly be becoming members as our family grows and our trips become more frequent! For the most enjoyment: start your visit early. There are ridiculous hoards of people trying to enjoy all the things you're trying to enjoy, but they usually show up in the afternoon. We got there at opening (9:30am) and stayed until noon. It was blissful. When we showed up at 3pm after our daughter's nap, it was a slight mess of people. Our stroller ran into lots of people. (Sorry!)This is a definite MUST when you're in the area, especially if you have kids!"
2869,2011-06-08,5,"My dad claims to have taken me here when I was younger. I seriously do not remember that so it was like my first time here.This place is amazing and you can easily spend a day here. I didn't have much trouble with parking as I stayed by the local Best Western and walked over. You can purchase tickets to the aquarium at the Best Western as well. Not only do you not have to wait in line but the ticket is good for two consecutive days. All for the price of one. Pretty sweet deal!My favorite exhibits were the seahorses, penguins, and flamingos. Not sure what else I can add that hasn't been said by my fellow Yelpers so read on."
2870,2011-04-03,3,"Not bad for a small local aquarium but left searching for more?I got discount tickets through work and they were still 26 dollars which is kinda sour when you can easily walk the aquarium in an hour. The aquarium is a HUGE deal up in monterey, but I am from Orange County so the Long Beach Aquarium and Sea World San Diego are super close and seeing one aquarium- you've seen them all.Not bad for kids tho- a lot of interactive sites like the Splash Zone and The Bat Ray exhibit. They also have an awesome wave simulator in the aviary and outside have an amazing view of the harbor - where I saw WILD SEA OTTERS ! :)And to be honest, it just seemed to me that the tanks were a little empty fish wise? Maybe its just me"
2871,2011-05-03,4,"Being from near Chicago and having visited the oceanarium in Sydney, an aquarium has to give me a good bang for my buck.This is a grand aquarium but does not receive the highest stars from me for two reasons (well mainly one but they are seperate issues to me).1) The main exhibit, Outer Ocean, was not opened2) There was no notification as to the Outer Ocean being unavailable until you paid the admission fee.If you live near here and have children or are just a nature enthusiest, this is an awesome place to have a membership towards with paying off the price with a few visits in the year.  As for the casual visitor, the price is right if ALL of the exhibits are open.  I did appreciate the one price for all as opposed to the add-ons the Shedd has for extra exhibits.I really loved the sea otter exhibit as well and I suggest you get a spot early for the feedings.  Not only are they entertaining but educational.  If your able and have the time, I highly recommend the different presentations which are held in the auditorium.  I felt they were educational as well as entertaining (but I can see how it may be a boring topic for others with different interests).The seahorses exhibit was really cool and I loved the turtles as well.  There was a nice bit of explinations and information about the creatures which I also found to be very helpful and entertaining.We only used a 1/2 day for this visit and it was enough for the others in my party, but I could see myself there for a full one (that is just me).  A must see for the nature lovers, although the extremists might try to free all of the creatures from the exhibits, or so I am told.  (Joke)"
2872,2011-10-23,5,"This place is always amazing!!! I think I could spend days staring at all of the exhibits. I also think it's great that they include seabirds as part of their displays. The other part of this place that is cool is the fact that a great majority of the exhibits are showing you what is occurring for real right outside the doors of the aquarium, which really gives you a sense of place when you walk outside."
2873,2014-08-03,5,"Amazing time!!!The staff that helps teach children to dive in the tide pools was excellent, my children loved the experience and the staff was sooo friendly and informative.  Patrick was great instructor!!!After the class, we ate att the restaurant and had good food with amazing view, what a special visit, we will go back again. Thank you to the great staff that is teaching the youth diving!"
2874,2016-05-17,4,Perfect for the kiddos. They have an entire area just for them to get hands one and run a muck!  The exhibits are great and the jellies and sea turtles seem to be crown favorites. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bathrooms were clean. Its a must if you are in the area.
2875,2011-09-12,5,"The greatest Aquarium I've been too.  It is worth your money!  They have a little area for kids too.  Its like a little cave you go into & the kids can see their own fishies.  Monterey Bay Aquarium has this one restaurant over there that has the best fish & chips ever!!! Also, they give you coleslaw with it.  Their clam chowder is really good too."
2876,2012-05-30,5,"The best aquarium I've been to...hands down! Very family friendly. Lots to learn about ocean creatures. Well put together exhibits for people of any age. The jelly  (as in jelly fish) exhibit was very entertaining and educational. (Yes, I said ""educational"" but don't let that deter you.) You'll have lots of fun.Attended the food festival that was going on by Whole Foods. Lots of free, delicious, samples. Cooking demonstrations which we didn't have time to enjoy as there was so much else to see."
2877,2010-12-21,5,"I love aquariums! and this is probably the best one I've been to. Even though the outer bay exhibit was closed, the rest of the aquarium was still fun. My favorite exhibits were the ""secret lives of seahorses"",  the sea otters, the outer bay jelly fish exhibit, and the splash zone.We only spent about 3 hours there but I felt like I could stay for another couple hours!Last bonus for the time spent at the aquarium was the sale on stuffed animals! I was able to buy a decent size stuffed penguin for $10, normally worth about $25.Even though I live so far away, it would be worth it to drive out if you wanted to visit an aquarium!"
2878,2014-07-30,5,"A wonderful afternoon for the family - Ages 2, 25, 30, 39 & 50.  We were all completely captivated.  The kids have a lot of play options to keep them interested.  The restaurant is outstanding.  And the gift shop is reasonable, with a wide and varied selection of items.  The otters are REALLY popular, so the line to get up close is slow - but worth it!"
2879,2012-01-24,5,"This place was great. It took us about 4 hours to get through the hole thing. Definitely check out the feeding shows. They are worth the 10-15 minutes. We parked nearby in a lot for $10 (right down the street from the lot for $15) and it was a nice couple block walk to the aquarium itself. There is so much to look at. I went on a Saturday and it was busy but not uncomfortably packed. If you're in the area this is a great place to take friends and family. Kid friendly, too. We packed a backpack of food and drinks and there were plenty of places to sit and eat lunch. Highly recommend! Everyone was so mice, too.$10 parking$32.95 for adults"
2880,2014-02-25,5,"This aquarium is very well kept. It is a great experience. I went while the jelly fish exhibit was there. It was very great. I had a very fun time. They have quite a few things to see. Definitely great for anyone, any age!"
2881,2014-02-25,1,"Small, very small - ads are deceiving. Very crowded and poorly planned. Took 30 mins to park, 20 to get tickets, 15 in line to bathroom (very few of those), and an hour of total wait for lunch. Much of the day is waiting in line or waiting for people to get out of the way to see something. But it's not just number of people - it's just poorly designed. Water is much less transparent than natural or other aquariums, so good pictures are unlikely. Worst aquarium I've been to so far, even though exhibits are pretty good, the overall experience is poor. If you want an enjoyable weekend, stay away. During the week it may be better, but still not up to the hype or even to what other, usually cheaper, aquariums offer."
2882,2013-11-12,5,"I love monterey bay aquarium! I have been here several times and enjoy it every time, no matter if I go with family, a date, or friends. It is huge and beautiful, and you can easily make a day of it. There are several nice beaches and restraints around the aquarium too. Just beware of ""busy"" days. Try to go during the week and not on holidays."
2883,2016-01-18,1,"Went over the weekend after reading all the good stuff online about this place, it was a big let down. Street parking is enforced 7 days a week so I parked in a private garage for $24 for the day. Spent $39.99 per adult to get in kinda pricey, the aquarium was over crowded, hot, boring, and smelly you'd think they'd turn on the AC for as much as your charged to get into the place. The main attraction is the big tank but after that everything else is boring."
2884,2010-09-30,5,"Even though this place needs another 5 star review like Lindsay Lohan needs more STDs, I'm still going to add another one.  I mean a review, not the other thing.  Before going to this aquarium, I envisioned a grand building fitted with romanesque pillars, a giant moat filled with tiger sharks, and a massive drinking fountain overflowing with a Moby Dick sized whale choking in its attempt to swallow a small seafaring vessel.  Okay, maybe not the last one since I don't want to see animals harmed...  Alas, we were met with nothing but disappointment.  When we arrived, the outside entrance was underwhelming.  Actually, it's the equivalent of a ""hole-in-the wall"" when you're considering that this is a world (freaking) class aquarium.  If you don't pay attention to where you're going you might mistaken the front for the delivery entrance.  A classic example of never judging a book by it's cover.  If you've ever been to an aquarium, then this place has the all typical aquarium stuff like the touch exhibit area where you get to molest live sea stars, cucumbers, and abalone.  There's also a pool area where you get to caress stingrays and even give 'em a light snack.  There are unique exhibits like the jellyfish or the giant underwater kelp forest exhibit.  What's so cool about kelp you say?  Well you've probably used it everyday without knowing.  In fact, it's in everything from your toothpaste to salad dressings and even ice cream.  One thing to beware of is the ultra super uber cute sea otters that play around in a huge two story tank.  Those little guys tend to tug at the heart strings of an unsuspecting passerby which subconsciously prompts them to the nearby gift store to purchase many sea otter related items.  But seriously, I really needed that fuzzy otter with the ridiculously big puppy dog eyes.  I mean...it's LOOKING AT ME to take him home.Word to the wise.  Tickets are purchased inside with adults costing $30.  However, if you're like us and determined to use your student ID until you reach senor status, then student tickets go for $28.  You can compound your savings and also get a $2 off coupon here: visitcalifornia.com/medi…I was tempted to give this place 4 stars because the Outer Bay Exhibit was closed!!  Won't open until the end of December?!  Wahhhht?  I gotta come back again?!  On the bright side, at least we'll get to use our student IDs."
2885,2011-01-03,5,"Generally, I'm suspicious of business which try to be all things to all people...but, to my amazement, the Aquarium somehow manages to pull it off by creating a place which appeals to, well......pretty much everyone. It's a world-class institution and, instead of trying to elucidate on those reasons, and repeating what's already been said in previous reviews, I'll content myself with adding another 5-start review to their average."
2886,2010-12-29,5,"I've been to other aquariums all around the country (ie. Boston, Dallas) and none of them even come close to Monterey Bay's!! I used to live in the East Bay and I loved taking day trips to Monterey/Carmel to visit here and then the beach in the afternoon. Places like these make me so proud to be a Californian.It is because of their world-renowned jellyfish exhibit that I fell madly in love with jellyfish. They also have the seahorse exhibit, though I think the jellyfish are still the premier players here. My other favorite exhibit are the sea otters. They are so cute!!The workers here are quite knowledgeable about the species they exhibit. You can tell they are passionate about marine life and it's contagious because everyone--kids and grown ups--eat it all up (the knowledge, not the fish!).The only thing I grow weary of are that sometimes this place is packed with snot-nosed kids who push each other around. I've seen some parents encourage it too!All in all, if you ever visit California, this is a MUST."
2887,2014-09-05,5,"A fabulous place to visit with kids! The exhibits are very informative and you feel enlightened with every interaction with the knowledgeable guides. The price is high though we have enjoyed the discount from the membership my cousin has for her family. I would compare its value only to the National Aquarium in Baltimore. It is light years ahead of the Smithsonian Aquarium in Washington, DC."
2888,2011-01-31,5,"Nice-n-Big, Nice-n-Crowded, Nice-n-screaming ass kids, Nice-n-Environmentally friendly, colorful too. Plenty of attractions for adults and kiddies. The Bay center itself is a wildlife/marine refuge and habitat. Not so ""cagey"" like a zoo. Go at night if you can... It's so much better than the crowded daytime trip. Passed by while taking a trip to Pebble Beach again w/ the rents in the summer of 10."
2889,2014-03-23,5,What an amazing place to visit. I learned a lot about the sea life as well as how we can help add to conservation. I am from the mountains so I find this place fascinating and very educational.
2890,2014-02-08,4,"Love this place. If your looking for a review for this place, just go. Its totally worth it. Experience the ocean as close to the source that many of us will ever get to it. The exhibits are well maintained and beautiful."
2891,2013-06-11,5,"A+ because all the staff are so friendly and smile all the time!! I'm glad that it doesn't seem that they hate their job! It's exciting seeing all the water friends, and they don't look depressed to be there either.. :)"
2892,2016-03-10,5,Well worth the entrance fee.  Give yourself at least 2-3 hours to enjoy the extensive exhibits.  Spent 20 minutes just watching the otters play.  The variety of life in the kelp forest and open seas is stunning.  Friendly and helpful volunteers.
2893,2011-04-05,5,I came here a few times as a kid and the best memory I have of this place is reaching down into a shallow pool and touching a starfish for the first time. I think I was 5 :)
2894,2014-01-02,5,"This aquarium is AWESOME. It it a research organization and is focused on the health of the worlds oceans and the creatures in it. I always come away with such a great sense of awe and love for the life in the ocean. My favorite thing to see is the sea otter exhibit. It is hard to miss because it is front and center. I highly recommend watching the feeding because you get to see some really cool behaviors and learn about this adorable sea mammals. Most people will crowd around the windows up top because that's where most of the action is. If you want to watch up there then get to the tank at least 20min before the feeding. And try to let little ones get up close so they can see. The otter feeding is at 10:30a, 1:30p, and 3:30p but you may want to either check the website of grab the map/daily event schedule they offer you at the door.I feel like I could spend all day at the aquarium; there is so much to see and watch and touch and learn about.If you are in Monterey, this is a must see."
2895,2014-05-06,5,"If you're going to be living in Monterey I highly recommend getting a 1 year pass.  It costs about as much as going twice without a pass, and it gives you the freedom to break it up into lots of smaller visits instead of trying to cram the whole thing into one day.  They also have some fun later events with wine and beer for adults that are great to go to if you don't want to be around too many screaming children."
2896,2014-07-07,3,"We had been wanting to visit the aquarium since we drove through monterey last year but couldn't justify spending $40 per person. We agreed to go this year after hearing good things about it. We went on a Sunday which probably contributed to how crowded it was so it was  a little difficult to get through the aquarium without being bumped into. The open sea exhibit was great. The presentation was very well done and the aquarium creates a great environment to explore all of the different types of creatures. The jellies exhibit was just as great- they had a lot of variety and provided a lot of information on each species. We attended one of the 15 minute shows featuring great white sharks and it was pretty informative. I would recommend doing that if you go. For the price, I expected a lot more. There were only four main sections and they tended to repeat each other a bit. The whole aquarium was a lot more kid oriented and I wish I knew that before I went. The aquarium seems to be doing a lot of good things for the ocean wildlife and I'm glad that my admission fee contributed to that I just think they could offer more for their guests as well."
2897,2013-04-03,5,"The MBA just has exhibit after exhibit of different sea creatures ranging from sea otters to jellyfish. I never thought I could trip out so much on jellyfish lol! Skipping all the kids exhibits you can get through it in 3 hours. It is worth the price to go here, but you just have to go right when they open because it can get crowded. Also too if you do go, get will call tickets so you can cut in front of all the people waiting to buy their tickets. You can do this on the aquariums website, it's fast and easy.  You have to go here if your in Monterey!"
2898,2011-10-26,4,"Visited with our granddaughter today.Nice to go during the week when all the kids are in school.We've been there several times and this is a great venue for kids to learn about the sea and its creatures.They have petting tanks, interactive displays, educational lectures and not to forget the most beautiful view of the Monterey Bay. The otters are always cute along with the shore birds etc.You should plan on 2-3 hours there.Bring your inner child and see what we take for granted."
2899,2011-01-13,4,"NiceGreat aquarium and great for a half day visit.  The exhibits are great and they are always changing it up a little so there is always something new to discover there.  The memberships are relatively affordable specifically the family memberships where you can each bring a guest.  That means we have four adult passes and one child pass for the entire season.  Members have a different entrance so no waiting in lines, no hassle."
2900,2011-05-02,5,"So far, out of all the aquariums I've ever been to, this is my absolute favorite!! I love that it is in one of my beloved cities, down an awesome street, with yummy surrounding restaurants.There's a lot to say about this aquarium, I'd never finish! Beautiful jellies, awesome deep sea section, cool tide pools area, etc. This place is truly your money's worth, and will become a favorite if it isn't already! I can't wait to visit again.  If I lived close by, I'd be here all the time!"
2901,2014-03-14,5,"Definitely recommend the Jelly fish tour. only $15 due to lack of interest I was the only. Got a personal tour.  The penguin feeding, shark show (video) and behind the scenes (video) were really cool. My only comment- I did the fish feeding tour and it was not what i expected. I ended up throwing krill into the large kelp tank and having to run downstairs to see the frenzy. people who didn't pay 15$ for the tour got to see the same thing I did but for free."
2902,2011-09-13,4,"""Ooohs"" & ""aaahs"" all around from children and grown-ups alike.  Their exhibits are spectacular and you can't help but be in awe of the amazing sea life God created.Favorite Exhibits:KELP FOREST: 28 feet tall kelp is amazing to see.  It's huge window to a diver's eye view of sardines, sharks, eel, and a myriad of other fish.  On the weekends, they have a feeding and diver's Q&A around 11/11:30am where you get to see the fish and sharks hand fed by a diver as well as get to ask the diver questions about the sea life, water conditions, etc.OPEN SEA: sea turtles!  They're huge, and so amazing to watch.  There are also sharks, giant tuna, and sardines.  One of the best parts are the brilliant jellyfish...bright coral colors against deep blue water...stunning!SEA OTTERS: so adorable!  The only thing is that it depends what time of day you're visiting because they're not always in the exhibit.  **PARENT ADVISORY: there are only 2 dining options on-site, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Restaurant or the Self-Service Cafe.  The full-service restaurant isn't really kid friendly and the self-service cafe is ridiculously over-priced (i.e. $10 for a 6"" diameter personal cheese pizza, which tastes mediocre at best or $10 for a 6"" long sandwich, also mediocre).  I regretted depending on their self-service cafe for lunch.  For me, husband, and 2.5yr old, we spent around $40.  Outrageous and super irritating.  I highly suggest packing a picnic lunch or buying somewhere and bringing (i.e. Togos, Quiznos, etc.) and eating on one of the many available seating areas inside or outside."
2903,2011-09-02,5,"Growing up in Northern California, this was always a destination for summer camps, and school field trips. I credit this place with my love and fascination with all things from the water. Displays, history, facts, exhibits, This place has something for kids of all ages. The pools are amazing for a hands on experience. Trips here will make memories for a lifetime. Even as an adult this place is amazing. Everything they do for the environment , education and understanding is what the human race should strive for. There is so much to take in, from the jelly fish to the sharks, sea otters, penguins, kelp, star fish, it's an amazing experience. Parking is expensive, it is very busy during the summer, and on weekend, but totally worth every penny and every bit of patience."
2904,2011-07-02,5,First time today. Second time at an aquarium EVER. I was very impressed. I know I came on a holiday weekend so it was packed. You just have to have enough balls to fight for your kids to be able to look at the exhibits when it's crowded. I have huge balls. My nephew got to look at everything.My husband had been here before and saw several new exhibits. My personal favorite was the sea horses. How freaking cute are they! Every type of seahorse ever is there. I did nickname the pot belly sea horse the beer belly horse. The aquarium even had great customer service for the 10 seconds I had to talk to them.Two tips:For women: don't use the first floor bathroom. You will be in line for 15 minutes. There is one on the second floor that no ones seems to know about.Tip Two: Buy your tickets online and print them at home. You will save yourself an additional 15 minutes.
2905,2014-06-29,5,"My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday and had a great time. A bit pricey but we felt it ended up being worth the cost ($40/person). Dont bother paying for parking, look for non-metered public street parking about 2-3 blocks away with no time limit. Allow yourself plenty of time, we were there about 4 hours and felt we had to rush at closing to see the last few things and re-visit my favorites, the sea otters, on our way out. Check out feeding times for the exhibits. The touch station was awesome too (you can even pet a stingray)! Be prepared for lots of children and crowds but I was so excited by the animals they didnt bother me. WAAAY cooler than the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago where I am from. Afterwards walk around Cannery Row, take a scenic drive, and grab some grub and a beer and it is one great date =)"
2906,2010-09-14,5,"I was so overwhelmed with visual stimuli, I found myself having to often find a place to rest against. Or wait maybe cause I was tired from all the damn walking cause monterey bay is that large.It's a sea-lover's dream to venture through rooms, halls and walkways huge tanks filled with creatures you only see on the discovery channel.  A skilled photographer or artist's perfect blank canvas. Beautiful. That's all I can really say."
2907,2011-01-17,5,"Our Monterey Bay trip was scheduled around this attraction and we were not disappointed. By the time all was said & done, we planned our visit for Saturday and spent a good portion of our afternoon there. Our first exhibit was called ""You Otter Know"" which was a brief educational session about Otters facilitated by an entertaining content expert that incorporated fun quizzes and video clips. The second exhibit allowed patrons to watch a trainer feed a pair of otters while they performed tricks for the crowd. Yeah, it sounds horrible but the otters were soooooooo cute, you weren't thinking about the fact that they weren't in their natural habitat.The rest of the aquarium was a wonderland of sealife bliss with beautiful displays of exotic creatures. Two expansive floors host a Penguin Spalsh Zone, Touch Pool, Kelp Forest, Hot Pink Flamingos, an Outter Bay to view animals, Octopus display and an auditorium for educational programs. My favorite room had the jellies and another room inspired will never be forgotten as I plan for my dream house: We walked into a dimly lit, cylindrical shaped room. Near the ceiling, an aquarium was built that held approximately 1000 silver smelt. The effect was mesmerizing as they circled the aquarium, catching a glint of the light that reflected their shimmering bodies, against a bluish/green background.Upon entry, our picture was taken in front of a blue screen & later superimposed it onto a still photo of the colorful fish tank located downstairs. We also had another photo taken on the main floor in front of a huge pair of dental impressions that reminded me of a dinosaur jaw. Both photos were on 8X10 and available for sale with the year and the museum title. Great reminders of the fun times we had visiting!"
2908,2011-01-21,5,"Being from the Monterey area- I know this is one of the sites that is high on the tourists list- but its actually not just great for tourists, great for locals too.I have visited multiple times since i was a child til now- really well kept and love every addition that takes place. I've been to a few aquariums now- and I might be a little biased (with my love for monterey bay) but this is the best one so far. I love the outside deck areas- great place to go when u need to get away from the hoards of people and take a breather before continuing your exploration. It is gorgeous and you can waves breaking under your feet. Def. a great experience!"
2909,2016-04-28,5,"I love this aquarium! Granted, I'm a marine science major at CSU Monterey Bay, which makes me slightly more enthusastic than the average person, but I must say, the Monterey Bay aquarium is great. They're constantly adding new exhibits and habitats, and they have a great release program that helps wounded animals. The aquarium is very large and clean, extremely easy to navigate, and they have such great shows. For any students in the area, I would recommend getting a membership, as its relatively cheap and saves you lots of money in the long term."
2910,2011-09-11,4,"Monterey Aquarium is one of my favorite aquariums still.  A lot of childhood nostalgia goes into the fondness for this place, but even to a newcomer, it's a fun place to visit.There is a lot to see, with the fish, corals, otters, jellys, whale stuff, and so on.  It's endless, and a lot of fun.Gripes are minor.  Some of the glass is of the magnified variety, which makes some of the exhibits really disorienting.  Also, you can't really...learn much here.  There isn't really any info per exhibit.  I always like reading about what I'm looking at, and this Aquarium has basically nothing.  Also, it's a bit pricey for what you get."
2911,2011-09-02,4,"Very fun place. Lots to see and lots to learn. Everything is so pretty! Make sure you have a good camera so you can capture all the awesomeness for a lifetime!I live in San Francisco, but I've never been to the Aquarium of the Bay here. I imagine it'd be something like this. Cannery Row is just like Pier 39 except I could spend more time at Pier 39 than Cannery Row.Bring your good walking shoes and a camera cuz you can spend all day here!"
2912,2011-05-10,5,"I'll spare you of the lengthy persuasive tactics that reviewers so heavily rely on and just say that no review is going to do this aquarium justice. Quite frankly, in this instance, reading reviews will only ruin the potential awe-inspiring surprises involved in your visit. (Yes, it's THAT good.)Simply put, just add the Monterey Bay Aquarium onto your bucket list, preferably near the top."
2913,2011-10-11,4,"some of the exhibits are so magical! Exhibits all have an abundance of space which is what other aquariums/museums lack. The only downfall is parking. Most cities are free on Sunday for parking the meters, but not good ol' Monterey."
2914,2013-04-28,4,I been coming here since I was in elementary school..  I love this place but hate the huge crowds on the weekends..  A season pass is a must if you plan to come again..  Hell your going to spend that much if you go once with the family..  Fork it up you will be glad u did the next time you come here.
2915,2015-03-26,5,"Best Aquarium I've ever been to, hands down. It's efforts towards conservation rather than having animals on display as ""entertainment"" are really what set it apart. They would never dream of holding cetaceans in captivity like many other aquariums do, and they focus many of their efforts on research and protecting the oceans. Also, they developed the Seafood Watch program which is now something used everywhere as an app on your phone so you can tell what seafood is sustainable before you buy it or order it at a restaurant. Just an outstanding organization. I don't feel bad visiting this aquarium because many of the animals (especially the marine mammals) who are there are there because of a problem or injury that prevents them from being released back into the wild. All of the staff and volunteers I've met are highly educated and enthusiastic about what they're doing and I just think there's no comparison in our nation to this aquarium. I've been to SHED, aquariums in the northeast, in Atlanta, and none compare."
2916,2010-11-22,5,"I love aquariums!  And this one is to be loved!  It's big, it has beautiful fish and sea animals.  It has the beautiful kelp forest.  It has so much to be loved!!  Besides all of that, the aquarium has a mission to use the money you spend there for conservation efforts which is amazing for our environment!  They have awesome interactive educational sections for your kids and even yourself to learn more about how to create a sea friendly more sustainable life for everyone.  So if you are looking for a great hands on educational experience for your kids, this is the aquarium to go too.  They also have an extensive gift shop with amazing artists creating sea related items that are both cute and depicted nicely.  Not a weird imatation of a sea creature like the ones you find in the vending machines sometimes.They have penguin feedings at certain times, and touch pools.  The only unfortunate thing right now is that the shark exhibit is being rennovated so its not open right now!  parking is on the streets or in lots.  if you get a membership which is worth your money in 3 visits, you can probably pop in for a few hours and if you visit the cannery outlet its 2 hours free parking.otherwise there are traditional meters around so make sure you have quarters!!"
2917,2011-04-12,5,"I gave this aquarium a 5 star because I just love their newest exhibit! The Secret Life of Sea Horses is humongous! This exhibit has soo many types of beautiful and ugly sea horses. They even have baby sea horses as small as an ant! I literally spent hours going through this exhibit. There are annoying kids blocking the way, but you know, I have to be grown person as I am and wait till they are finish...The Jelly Fishes were awesome too! Loved the star fish petting area.Definitely the most epic aquarium ive been to! No where else compares!"
2918,2014-04-12,5,"One of the best aquariums you will ever visit! They have multiple permanent displays and some they switch out.  When we went they had jelly fish, which was awesome and they were talking about bringing in a great white shark! They have a one million gallon tank which is awesome to look at..definitely worth going"
2919,2012-12-03,5,"I have a deep love of the ocean, and just about everything about it: the cycle of life it perpetuates on earth, the thousands of worlds it contains, all of it is fascinating to me. What I have loathing for, though, is organizations who try to pass themselves off as institutions of learning, and/or conservatory and preservation.Seaworld is one such an example. On the surface, Seaworld would like people to think that their intended goals are to raise awareness of the oceans and their importance to life on this earth, through a series of amusement park rides, miserable animals captured under highly questionable to outright horrifying circumstances, and lots and lots of beer sales.Boy, I feel enlightened already! On the other hand, there's the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Founded in 1984 by four marine biologists and gift funding from David & Lucile Packard, and based in the former Hovden Sardine Cannery, The Monterey Bay Aquarium's goals are to educate visitors on the marine-world that makes up Monterey Bay and beyond through the use of state-of-the-art aquariums, displays, interactive exhibits, and presentations- all done tastefully, humanely and  in a way that you will come away feeling more illuminated. The staff & volunteers are patient, courteous, helpful, and knowledgeable of the exhibits, tanks, day-today operations, and history of the Aquarium, the former cannery, and even Cannery Row (to a degree- any questions they cannot answer, they will be able to point you in the right direction The Aquarium does have dining facilities. However, because of the amount of people visiting on this particular weekend day, it cannot be commented on, which leads to the next topic... The biggest complaint that most people have about the aquarium, is the amount of kids that are running about. And to a degree, I see their point. So to parents, would-be parents, grandparents, and watchers of young'uns I say to you this: If they're under the age of five, skip the aquarium. Chances are that they won't remember the visit, and will have the same effect as if you were showing a dog a card trick. And if you must insist on bringing them, Please don't roll the strollers into areas where you're told not to, make pathetic excuses on how they'll appreciate the visit when they get older (heard this one from the parents of a six-month-old sleeping infant) and especially *PLEASE* don't load them up on sugar before your arrival- which may result in my following you back to your hotel or motel, and gifting your kids two dozen Pixie Stix and a can or two of Red Bull right before bedtime. For everyone else looking to avoid the munchkin hoards, or large crowds in general, consider going during the weekday, preferably in the off-tourist seasons Overall, a visit to the aquarium is breathtaking and illuminating. To describe a trip here is difficult to put into words, perhaps, other than to say that it is to experience life itself in all it glory, as it exists in more than 70% of out planet."
2920,2011-04-24,3,"A bit underwhelmed. Was so excited to spend the entire day at the aquarium.  Unfortunately, there was only enough there to fill 2.5 hours and that's with my obsession with the sea otters and the 30 minutes I spent there.The sights they did have were spectacular, i.e. the jelly fish, sea horse exhibits, penguins and the sea otters, but I left a bit disappointed and didn't feel it was worth the $30 price tag."
2921,2011-04-18,5,"This place is the coolest.  There is so much to see and the layout makes it easy to navigate through the aquarium to check out everything if you have the time.  One of my favorite thing's about this aquarium is that there are a lot of interactive stations, especially great for kids.  My other favorite things to see here are:Sea otter feeding The lovely sunfishJellyfish and the sea horses!"
2922,2011-08-20,4,"This is one of my favorite places to go and still is, especially not during the weekend or summer tourist season. Unfortunately for me, neither of those preferences were met because my nephew was visiting from out of town and I couldn't wait for him to see it. He thought it was outstanding & I got to see some things I normally wouldn't see, like fish feeding in the kelp forest. It was also feeding time for the octopus & a rare sight to see it moving around. Everything is nicely laid out, colorful, and there's so much to see. I wasn't happy with the pushy people trying to get to the front of the tank, rather than waiting their turn. A few interactive exhibits didn't work, that's why I didn't give it 5 stars (and of course they were some of my favorite ones that I wanted to share with my nephew). I liked the upgrade to the Open Sea exhibit, with the addition of the puffins & sea turtles. Not sure why there were 2 (or was it 3) tanks of moon jellies in that area. We saw as much as we could before everyone was tired out."
2923,2011-01-17,5,"Really - do you need someone else to tell you how awesome this place is? :)  Kids are never happier than when visiting here.But, I had no idea of the great cafe/restaurant here.  No need to leave for a lunch-break - you won't find better on Cannery Row.  Yes, a bit pricey but when you consider the view, it's all good."
2924,2016-03-18,5,"Seems pricey until you get inside and see the really fabulous and high tech displays. Lots of docents working with kids and adults alike. Very cool with excellent lighting  and spiffy decor. Great collection of sea life with lots of good scientific info to explain it all. I understand that parking is limited so we took the free (weekends, anyway) trolley from downtown Monterey. Having been here, I'm really surprised that their entry fee is as low as it is. Lots of bang for your buck. A real ""not to be missed"" if you're in the area."
2925,2011-04-01,5,"This place is a tiny piece of magic, formed into the physical and placed here on earth for the sheer purpose of creating pure moments of child-like wonder.You need to come here at least once in your life."
2926,2013-10-24,5,One of the WORLD'S best attractions! I was born and raised in the Salinas Valley in Monterey Bay. I love that it's located in my hometown area!!! Check it out if you're ever in Monterey!
2927,2016-04-16,5,"By far the greatest aquarium on earth!  We love using our membership, the new restaurant was delicious, and if you have small kids - we really really love Splash Zone!"
2928,2013-12-31,4,"A must see of course if you are a fan of the magical and colorful water life. We stop by every time we pass through Monterey to get another glimpse of those beautiful varieties of Jelly fish, it's memorizing to watch them. Parking a couple blocks away, convenient and walking distance, lots of touristy shops around, not all that great for food options ( that's my only complaint but that's typically the case with all these types of attractions anywhere).  Enjoy!"
2929,2011-06-05,5,"How can I not give it a 5 star?Whenever you mention the city of Monterey, people think of this aquarium. Thats how influential this place is.They have gotten expensive over the years. I think about $30 for a adult now. Little discount for student with school IDs.Bring your girlfriend or family here. It's a relaxing and joyful place to enjoy the ocean and sealife. It is about 2 hours away from SF, but it's worth it some times. I usually come here once a year. After the aquarium, enjoy the ocean view/breeze, and finish it off with a nice dinner.Great for little kids too!"
2930,2011-09-16,5,"When you are in Monterey, it is a must stop to come to the aquarium. It can be pricey but worth it. The building is pretty, the layout is spacious, complete with a couple gift shops. All the ""harry otter"" stuff you see in monterey gift shops is just about as old as all the ""sleepless in seattle"" merchandise those places try to sell. I suggest taking your time strolling through here, great way to spend an afternoon before doing lunch on the pier."
2931,2011-01-31,4,"$30 a person.  Crowded as f$%#.  If you want to beat the crowds come the first hour they are open.  When I had my membership I would take my son when he was toddler we would come for the first 1-1.5 hours and then jam before he got trampled to death.  Its always crowded any day of the week, any day of the year.If you get the membership they will pester the shit out of you for money and try and guilt trip you with their conservation propaganda constantly.  I got rid of my membership after some rude calls around the holidays.Anyway, the aquarium is one of the best you ever see although they don't have big mammals like killer whales or dolphins.  Guess thats sea world exclusively.  The exhibits are beautiful, ever changing, well lit and they have a collection of specimens you will be overwhelmed with.  Recommendations The Outer Bay exhibit is breath taking, especially during feeding time.  The fish go friggin nuts.  A must see.  Really cool jellies too.Sea Horse Exhibit is a must sea(see how I did that?)  The dragons are just downright magicalI hate penguins.  They are gross, they smell and they shit everywhere.  Just nasty.  Thats an opinion not a rec.Kelp Forest and that lower level rounds out the 3 major attractions.  The rest mix propaganda and a few animals.  The Pink Flamingos is straight up obnoxious with its conservationism."
2932,2011-12-27,5,"This place is amazing!!!Its huge, so many things to look at and the tours are great. So many different things to see and so many different kinds of fish.Most def coming back!!! Totally worth it!!!"
2933,2012-09-07,5,"Amazing place! Best aquarium  I've ever visited! I love the huge tanks with entire marine ecosystems, the mollusks, otters, and of course the jellyfish!  Where can I get a built-in tank surrounded by a picture frame for my living room!?  The jellyfish room was so relaxing, I could sit and watch for hours!    Best visit I had was around December timeframe, as the place is swarming with kids most other days, rendering it nearly impossible to get very close to the tanks.  I love kids, but these little ones wiped things on the glass and one actually licked the tank's glass outer wall. If i were a parent, i would be mortified! But as an observer i just laughed and used hand sanitizer if i touched the rails:-) I love the conservationist approach taken by the aquarium and learned much from the educational outreach.  I was able to identify many species on later dives into the cold, kelp forests off the Monterey coastline. What fun! Now if only I could dive into the big tank!!"
2934,2013-10-16,4,"Great aquarium, but the otter exhibit was closed the past weekend :( Kids under two are free, and students with an id get 3$ off."
2935,2016-04-11,5,"Just a beautiful aquarium.  Located at the end of cannery row, it is easy to spend all day just relaxing and looking at the sea life."
2936,2010-10-07,5,"From the outside, it doesn't look like much. But, once inside, you really get a sense of why so many people love Monterey Bay Aquarium. While this place would appeal more to kids, as an adult, it still did not disappoint! The different sections of the aquarium were very informative, educational and fun. Definitely worth the $30 admission.The exhibits are focused on the delicate marine ecology, environmental protection and conservation.Inside you can find:- Jelly Fish -  my favorite exhibit featuring various types of ethereal and other-worldly Jelly Fish. So beautifully showcased. AMAZING!- Penguins - so cute!- Sea otters - super cute cute cute!- Sea horses - exotic and intriguing - Kelp forest - a giant fish tank showcasing marine life found along California kelp forest complete with schools of sharks, eels and countless other fishes among towering sea kelp- Giant octopus  - interesting to see up close- Large schools of fish swimming in formation- Sea anemones - beautiful colors!- Tide pools where you can touch star fish, rays, sea urchins and other critters of the sea - Fascinating history of cannery row- And MORE!They also have different events being shown inside the theatre at various times throughout the day. The one we saw was a fascinating look at how animal anatomy help inspire inventors to solve problems. We learned how whale flipper shapes help design more efficient wind mills for harnessing wind power and how the box fish shapes (found near reefs) helps shape a more-aerodynamic car with much improved fuel efficiency. Overall a great way to spend a few hours of your day and a definite must-visit destination in Monterey if you have not been."
2937,2011-10-13,5,"I spent my 40th Birthday here at the aquarium it was truly beautiful and a great day. My friend (boss) Vinny's wife Suzie B (also my friend) has a great friend who is the manager at the aquaruim so everything was complimentary and special for my birthday. I love the yellow angel seahorses they were my favorite, so exotic! jP & I shopped ate and drank up and down Cannery Row, went back to Marine took a nap and got ready for the best 40th bday dinner EVER!"
2938,2013-07-22,5,"I am someone who loathes zoos. They smell, you can never find the animals, and when you do, they're never doing anything. That said, I am a lover of aquariums. And THIS aquarium is by far the best I've ever been to. The exhibits are endless, the tour guides are informative, and there's something not 'mechanical' bout this particular aquarium. I've been disappointed when going through some places within an hour, but you can easily spend half your day here. Absolutely worth the price of admission."
2939,2014-06-27,2,"Goods:-keeps kids busy (10 yr old & under)-AC is strong and cold during summerBads:- tickets are too expensive for its quality- and most shows are pointless- for example the ""otter show"" is only to see feeding works, during weekend with 300+ people standing in front of 3 small windows- ""think big"" is a generic musical show for kids in kindergarten age, I actually feel bad for singers to entertain audiences with half-broke toysI don't recommend people to visit here because it does not have much of contents .  I do come here because I can't stop friends from all over the world and ask me to be the guide and pay for my ticket...  And yes, most of them feel the same way."
2940,2012-12-08,5,"Beautiful, awesome, neat, educational...this is one super aquarium! I could sit and watch the jellyfish exhibits all day. Helpful hint; don't pay full price ($34.95 at the door)...if you're a AAA member, tix are only $29,95 each and are good for a whole year from purchase."
2941,2014-01-23,5,"So fun! Interactive, beautiful displays. The live feeding and the sardines swirling, sharks, tuna and beautiful jellyfish were all a sight to see. The baby otter topped it all off."
2942,2012-03-11,5,"I love this aquarium.  I really enjoy coming here.  We renew our membership here, and feel like we come here often enough to warrant a membership.  Plus our son is almost 2 and he really loves something different each time we go.  This last trip he really enjoyed watching the jellyfish, penguins, and of course the deep ocean tank, which always has different animals in it.  I personally enjoyed the sea turtles, the huge school of Sardines, and the sunfish (my personal favorite since I was a kid).  Aside from amazing exhibits, I really enjoy my trip when I get to learn something new each time, after having gone to the aquarium for more than 15 years.  I always feel like I left the place with a little more knowledge.  The volunteers are great.  One lady Alex was really informative and took the time to explain the microorganisms that live on/around the kelp.  So awesome.  I think in general most first time visitors probably won't stop at the volunteer stations because there is so  much to see and do, but for repeat visitors like me it is refreshing to learn new stuff every time!  My wife and son love this place and so do I.  The staff does a wonderful job making your trip enjoyable.  The best time to go is during the week when it's less busy, but if you have no choice the weekends are fine too it's just a little more crowded."
2943,2011-07-15,5,"This place is better than Seaworld! So what if they don't have dolphins or whales, in fact, I preferred that they didn't. What an amazing aquarium! Beautiful displays. Every exhibit was gorgeous. My favorites were the jellyfish and the seahorses. What I loved most about this aquarium is that it is extremely kid friendly and interactive. There were tons of places where you could read more, learn more, see more, experience more. Throughout the aquarium, there were areas where kids could interact with the displays. And the kids area on the second floor was VERY cool. It made me want to be a kid again... or at least HAVE a kid to pretend like I belonged. I also loved that they have encourage people to be green! At different spots around the aquarium, there are pointers and tips as to how to be greener at home and why the environment should be cared for... something everyone should be doing.The entrance fee, although I originally thought was a little steep, was well worth it. I enjoyed the aquarium very much! **This is a great spot for field trips! It's very much a learning experience!"
2944,2013-04-03,5,"Loved the aquarium, have seen others this good too, but kids of all ages enjoy this, especially the area where you can put your hands in and feel starfish, hermit crabs, etc... Our youngest couldn't get enough of that!!   Much more expensive than expected, but had to do it just this once. Since it was too crowded and a long line outside, we left, went to Carmel and came back at 3:00 to find no line and faster getting through.  We were done in 1.5 hours without visiting the theater.  Great place if your can spend the money."
2945,2013-04-02,5,"Oh my gosh what an amazing place! Spent the entire day and probably didn't see nearly everything. Loved it! We went early on Sunday morning, got there around 10 a.m. and there were no lines to get in and the halls were not as crowded. When we left to go have lunch outside around 12:30 p.m. the lines were really long.Had a lot of fun and learned a lot."
2946,2013-10-01,5,I absolutely love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! So much to do and learn. The otters are adorable and the jelly fish are amazing! The view of the bay is beautiful. If you're in Monterey the Aquarium's a must! :)
2947,2011-02-08,4,"Got a ""family"" membership and headed into burn off our lunch.  Son was on a mission to answer a list of question provided by his teacher so we moved quickly through the exhibits.The Penguins are always our favorite but todays close second was the Octopus!  Tip: Ask the front desk about their new ""texting"" feature!  The museum will text you when unscheduled feedings are about to happen!"
2948,2012-03-06,4,"I love the aquarium and as aquariums go, this one is the best. They filmed ""Star Trek Voyage Home"" here after all.My only complaint is the crazy ticket prices. 33 bucks? Really? 20 bucks yeah but daaang. That is overpriced. I remember when they were 15 bucks."
2949,2013-03-23,5,Love the sea horse exhibit!! It's so fantastic. The sharks were amazing to I can't wait to come back.
2950,2011-07-24,4,"I have always had a fascination with the ocean. I would definitely consider it my first love.Scoring member passes from my manager, Boyfriend and I came for a visit during our staycation in Monterey. The admission price is otherwise roughly $30 for general adult admission. We spent nearly 5.5 hours here, wandering the exhibits and reading the plaques (though, to be honest, the reason it took so long was because I was insistent on trying to take photos of EVERYTHING).The focus of the Aquarium is definitely to educate; there are informational plaques next to every exhibit, describing the animals within each one. My favorite exhibit will always be the jellyfish, though The Secret Lives of Sea Horses is definitely a close second.It's a great place for kids, but keep a close eye on them; there are what feels like millions of kids running around everywhere, and if you're not careful, yours might go running off to look at a different exhibit and disappear as soon as you turn around.There are a couple of hands-on exhibits where they let you touch stingrays, starfish, sea urchins, sea weed and other such things, but their ""hand washing station"" literally consisted of a paper towel dispenser and hand sanitizer, so be warned now if you're a germaphobe.A definite (and in my opinion, the only) downside would be the lack of parking. While there are parking garages nearby, they fill up extremely quickly. Metered parking is also ridiculous because it keeps you constantly watching the clock and scrambling for change (the meters let you fill up to about 8 hours worth of time, I believe, but really? Who keeps 8 hours worth of quarters, dimes and nickels on the at all times?!). Otherwise, I think it's a great place to go visit once every now and again."
2951,2011-08-03,4,Very good aquarium. I cant say its the best i've been too but its pretty darn good. The thing i was most impressed by was the HUGE Ocean Sun fish. That thing looked like a roided up bull! I've seen them in the wild but this thing was unreal. In the same tank there was a school of yellow fin tuna which i though was pretty neat. There was also a touch pool where you could touch a bat ray and skate but my wimp gf wouldn't touch it...oh well lol.Definitely a must see in Monterey though. They do offer military discount....you just have to ask for it.I'd say its more exciting for children.
2952,2016-01-13,5,I'm a fan of aquariums and natural science in general. The wildlife viewing area would be perfect for a kraken! And don't forget the giant sea bass!
2953,2008-11-18,5,"A visit to this Aquarium is an all day experience so you really do get your moneys worth, they even let you get a pass out so you can go away for lunch and come back. From deep water tanks filled with sharks to rockpools where you can put your hands in and feel rays and other safe creatures there is something to keep everyone amused. One of the must see sections are the Sea Otters, they can be seen above and below water so you can watch them as they play and feed - very funny. There is a cafe and shop so you can buy toys and postcards, etc to remind you of your trip."
2954,2013-07-29,5,"This place has a bunch of reviews, so it doesn't require too much of a description. Suffice it to say that the reviews are true. This is one of the best aquariums I've ever been to and is great for all ages. It's definitely worth the trip."
2955,2014-02-24,5,"Easily one of the best aquariums out there. We were lucky enough to get the back stage tour (ok, full disclosure it was my birthday and it cost a total of $15, highly recommended!). If you're in Monterey and like stuff that lives in the water then you have to go to the aquarium. Simple as that."
2956,2011-05-18,3,"Entrance fee $29.95, $2 less for military/student.Heard this place was a must see, sadly when we went last week the main tank with the sharks as well as the jellyfish exhibit were closed.  I hear that's part of the amazingness, so you may want to postpone your visit until they re-open this summer.This place is definitely not for people who get annoyed by large groups of children running around and pushing you out of their way so they can see.I did really appreciate all of the effort they put into educating people about saving the oceans and the seafood watch cards they give out to help you understand the impact your food choices can have."
2957,2011-06-07,4,"Just not enough good stuff for five stars, but what is good is very good.  I recommend the jellyfish and seahorse exhibits.  The large mammals exhibit is closed for now -- you should check their website to see when it will reopen.  Other than that, the aquarium has a lot of conservationist hype with little new information and not much else.  Most kids seem to get bored after a while because it is all watching with very little action, and only a small amount of hands-on experience.  Hint: you can buy your tickets in advance if you are sure you are going, but the ticket line moves fast."
2958,2015-11-22,5,An Amazing aquarium. Yearly membership is not expensive and tax deductible.
2959,2017-04-21,5,love this place...great to get in touch with nature and terrific gift shop
2960,2010-07-06,5,"Amazing! Sea otters, seahorses, pink flamingos, and penguins. All my favorite animals in one place. This place is amazing. We went in the late afternoon and missed the kid rush getting four hours of mostly kid free fun. Plus there was a complimentary wine tasting and live jazz Saturday and Sunday night during the summer. We had a blast! Next time I will make a weekend of it!"
2961,2010-08-15,4,"Earlier this week, I took my sister and her fam to Monterey Bay Aquarium.Pretty impressive stuff.This place is big.From a layout perspective, it's much longer than it is wide, and splits roughly into three sections, with a multi-storied aquarium at each end, and one in the center.  There's also an outer area that faces the ocean with a diving pool (for children 8-12, I think, with instructors) that is cut off from the sea, but still uses the seawater, and allows seeing and interacting with some sealife, and a canoe harbor where you can rent canoes to go out into the marshland like kelp covered bay (also comes with instructor/guide.Back inside, the museum is split into two floors, with either end culminating in the large multi-storied aquariums, a central walkway connects the two ends of the museum, and the middle aquarium (the touch pool) is just off to one side of the central walkway.  You can look at the massive aquariums from the base level or the second floor.  Between these two massive aquariums are several smaller areas with various interactive components or other smaller but cool aquariums.  There's one donut shaped one, that's probably about 15 feet or so along the inner rim, with small finish swimming in a circle.  This donut aquarium runs along the ceiling above you.  Another has various kelp...More standard looking aquariums have various species of jelly fish, or sea horses/sea dragons, and other sea creatures.  Yet another is for penguins and still another is for turtles.  They also have water based interactive devices.Those two giant multi-story aquariums on either end have very large sea creatures, like smallish to medium sharks, giant tuna, manta rays and a variety of other animals.  Of all the various parts to this aquarium, I'd have to say that the jellyfish and sea horses/dragons were my clear favorite.  Though the cuttlefish were very impressive. I could stare at these exhibits for hours on end.  So peaceful, mesmerizing, hypnotic.From a dollar value perspective, I'd definitely say this place is worth a visit.  And I'll definitely be back again.Most definitely, I can confidently state:Yay!  i'm a fan!"
2962,2012-10-28,5,I have not always been a yelp user but now that I am an avid yelp user I keep remembering places that I visited prior to yelp that I still feel warrant a review. Monterey is one of my favorite places to go for a short break away from it all. For Valentines last year we took a little overnight trip to Carmel but spent the day on Cannery Row. I LOVE the ocean and marine life so we decided to go to the aquarium after lunch. I really enjoyed this experience. It is quite beautiful and large!!! there is so much to see and we really enjoyed ourselves. I loved the jellyfish that glowed in the jellies experience section. Not only were they beautiful because the glowed but just watching them move and swim was interesting because they are so peculiar looking. It is pretty expensive for tickets but tourist attractions typically are and you can spend hours in there and get your money's worth. Also the ticket sales go to the upkeep of the place and keeping the fishies happy so it's for a good cause. They ave a touch tank with some rays in it which is pretty cool. You can also hold some starfish and other creatures. I loved that part. You get see different tanks that range from marine life that lives closer to the surface all the way down to the deep dark ocean floor. They also have some displays of different whales and the displays are the actual sizes of the whales which fascinates me personally. I love whales and it is crazy how big they are! They have a gift shop of course with over priced novelty items where my hubby bought a stuffed penguin. The penguins were his favorite attraction. I loved the sea otters! They are so cute. We spent a good 3 hours here. If you are in Monterey I recommend splurging and experiencing this. You only live once. You get to see a lot and learn a lot too so why not? Plus they do allow you catch your memories on camera by taking photos.
2963,2013-04-24,5,"What else can I say ? Still a must see!! The sunfish was unfortunately not there, but the giant tuna, wolf eel and penguins made up for it. I go fishing all the time and seeing what goes on under the boat is very interesting. It also shows us how abundant  life throughout the sea......even when we can't see it. The delicate ecosystem of the ocean must be recognized and protected for the future."
2964,2013-10-12,4,Great for a family day trip. Very interesting exhibitions. Although it's been a little not so well-organized recently. Hope it will get better soon.
2965,2013-12-26,5,"I love this aquarium, I never get tired of it.  From the surrounding areas to the exhibits themselves, it's all such an experience.  My two favorite exhibits are the Deep Sea and the Kelp Forest.  Also worth checking out is the landing outside, where you can spot otters and seals swimming through the kelp."
2966,2014-04-16,5,Warm and friendly volunteers with so much great information. Just ask! We are members and go as much as we can and never get tired of it!
2967,2015-05-02,5,"This place is awesome! Definitely for the family. They have tours, exhibits, binoculars to borrow to see the dolphins, and so much more. The sea otters are so cute and entertaining. A whole day could be spent here and what I found neat was the jelly fish exhibition. The atmosphere and groovy music was very entertaining. They do dance to their own rhythm! They have student discount at $34.95! Take advantage!"
2968,2011-09-06,5,"A group of five of us (ranging in age from 20 to 28) spent a whole afternoon here and fully enjoyed ourselves!We ended up splitting up the day and doing half of the aquarium, going to lunch, and then coming back to do the rest.  Best part: the sea horse exhibit!  A must-see.The events they have going on in the theater are totally overrated (I think it's secretly there to give parents a snooze break from taking care of their kids).  Okay, yes, the Yelpers who give this place less stars because of the kids...  Duh!  Sorry!  I mean, you're going to an aquarium...  Head to the local brewery tour if you are not a fan of the kids, you know?  I think that this is a testament to how the aquarium appeals to all audiences, young or old.  Everyone loves it and wants to enjoy it."
2969,2013-01-01,5,"I came here when admission was free to residents of Monterey County! Yay for relocating! I'm from Southern California and found this aquarium to be way better than the one in Long Beach. It was a lot bigger and had an amazing jelly fish section that left me mesmerized. I loved the huge open sea tank and could've stood there for a really long time just watching the sea turtle and sharks swim by. My only disappointment in this trip was the fact that the Sea Otters weren't there. We asked the information guy where the sea otters went and he replied with, ""They went on strike because they wanted a bigger tank."" Cute. I'll be back!"
2970,2011-01-01,4,"Came to the aquarium while staying in Monterey.  I had not been back to the aquarium since I was in the 3rd grade.  There were plenty of exhibits and the seahorses exhibit was amazing.  The sea otters were really cute.It was a bit pricey for $30 bucks per adult, but felt it went to a good cause since it goes to help preserve the sealife.My one only complaint was TOO MANY KIDS.  I mean I understand its a place for children to learn about sea animals but way too many kids with irresponsible parents.I was trying to get a shot of these beautiful jellyfish that turn invisible without light.  You press the button and the light turns off for 20 seconds.  This stupid kid pushes her way into my shot and keeps pressing the button over and over for like 5 minutes.  I patiently wait for her to stop pressing the button then the girls older sister complains to her dad that she won't let her push the button.  Then the other sister starts pressing the button over and over, while us adults are WAITING for her to stop so we can get a shot of the tiny jellies. UGH. :P"
2971,2013-12-20,5,"absolute must see if you are in the area! We have a decent aquarium nearby, but it was nothing compared to this. The huge displays provided a view like none other. Do yourself a favor if you plan to see a feeding or a show though, and get a spot early. We weren't able to see the Sea Otter feeding at all and we even showed up a few minutes early. The jellyfish exhibit is amazing, and unlike anything I've ever seen. So glad we were able to make it here on our trip."
2972,2010-11-09,4,"The displays and the sea creatures are just fantastic. The land animals you encounter may not be so great. I'm not entirely sure how the octopi deal with it: the exuberant bipeds with their faces smashed up the glass, making movies with their phones, ignoring the ""NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY"" signs. Slowly the crowd thins out and the flashing stops and the animals look out through the seawater and glass and here comes another wave of exuberant bipeds rushing to smash their faces up against the glass."
2973,2011-02-09,4,"Come on a non-peak day.I took my 20 month old here for the first time and although I was afraid she would have a breakdown or her attention span was going to be too short, she lasted from 10-12:30 and had a wonderful time and we were able to hit most of the exhibits.  There are so many things for a toddler to do and see, I was very impressed with the play areas, touch pools, and splash zone.I also recommend you have an alternative to a stroller, because you need to park your stroller in a number of places your stroller can be a bit inconvenient."
2974,2011-02-23,5,Our favorite aquarium in the Pacific!A must see are the sea otters and tuna!
2975,2013-06-04,4,"I'm sure everyone already knows about this place, but I wanted to include it on my Monterey area list. I will give some tips from our recent visit. We were able to get tickets ahead of time at our hotel's front desk. It was good because we were literally the first people to be admitted when the doors opened, other people were lining up at the ticket counter. Also, we went on a Friday so it wasn't crowded at all. We basically had the run of the place. Highlights for our family were the penguins and the jellyfish. We also liked the wave generation machine, which was in a neat little alcove worth checking out."
2976,2011-10-01,4,Price was $30 a pop = $60 + $10 for parking = $70. Exhibits were cool and the ocean view was nice but was able to cover the entire aquarium within 2-3 hours.Pretty expensive but had fun and it was one of the nicer aquariums I have been to.
2977,2016-01-31,5,"Been coming here since I've been a little kid, and this place just never gets old! Sure, the exhibits haven't changed drastically in the past couple of decades, but I honestly discover something new every time I visit. The Experience: My most recent visit took place on a very busy Saturday. Came through with a couple of homies who hadn't seen the aquarium in a long time. They're pretty into photography, so we were looking to just explore the city and learn a little bit about the ocean around us while taking some cool pics. Unfortunately the lighting is a little rough in most of the exhibits, but this just means more time to observe and appreciate the wildlife on display here. They were pretty bummed that the pics weren't turning out, but all that changed when we hit up the the luminous Open Sea exhibit (feat. Jellyfish on Jellyfish). For those of you who haven't been, the Jellyfish exhibit is probably the most mesmerizing thing you have yet to see. These mysterious creatures are just floating around in illuminated tanks and the glow they give off is pretty cool. Coupled with the fact that they kinda just drift along, you could easily catch yourself staring for minutes on end. Another great part about the aquarium is the outdoor overlook that looks out onto the beautiful Monterey Bay. It's a great place to just sit and enjoy your surroundings while also checking out the many creatures that reside in the bay. You're almost certain to see an otter playing in the kelp. The occasional flock of pelicans may glide by, and you might also catch a not-so-frequent sighting of a Humpback whale.The Exhibits: Monterey Bay Aquarium offers countless exhibits for your party to enjoy. In my opinion, the top exhibits are the Jellyfish and Sea Otter exhibits. The jellyfish are hella cool, and the sea otters are hella cute and playful. The deep sea fish tank is a pretty close second, and the penguins are also pretty fun to watch. Also, don't sleep on the auditorium shows. They're not exactly blockbuster productions, but they're a great way to educate yourself on subjects you know nothing about. I've recently seen the shark and deep sea shows, and they're both eye-opening. Summary: Honestly one of the coolest and most educational places in Northern California. A must-visit for any tourist visiting the Bay Area for the first time, and a must-visit for any locals looking for an awesome day trip in a beautiful city! Five stars."
2978,2013-12-13,5,"This is just a must go. Otters, fish, jellies, turtles. And the volunteers make the experience even more enjoyable. It's a perfect little trip. They keep it maintained and the animals appear well cared for. They even have enjoyable ocean related art."
2979,2011-03-18,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is incredible. The jellyfish exhibit is my favorite by far, and it makes for some awesome photo ops as well.Although the tickets can be rather pricey, they are worth every cent. There is absolutely no wonder why this aquarium is world famous.I also recommend enjoying a brownie of the special variety beforehand, to optimize your experience. ;)"
2980,2012-01-29,5,Iggy: entered building with wife and kids upon entering you see the otter nice facility clean people from all over dim lighting with ocean like feeling. Kids played with touchable activities all water related this place puts you with sea life just relax and enjoy.
2981,2011-01-03,4,"Love this place! Great exhibits, friendly and helpful staff, and a fun place for all ages. When I found out my best friend hadn't ever visited an aquarium, a girl in her mid-20's, I had to take her there. I was a little worried it would be too geared for young kids, but we had a lot of fun. We learned about a lot of animals and the touch pools were very cool.I've noticed a lot of complaints due to big crowds and tons of kids. My advice is to go a little later on weekdays. We had the place to ourselves 3pm on a Monday. Even the staff kept telling us we picked the perfect time to stop by.One star knocked off because it's so expensive. $30? I paid $27 with a student discount, but still a lot. And they reduce it to $24 if you come in for the last hour only. AND the largest tank was closed from viewing due to turtles damaging it. I understand why they would still charge full price (I'm sure their expenses have only increased) but it still sucked missing it. It's like Space Mountain being closed."
2982,2014-01-26,5,"This is an awesome aquarium! Very worth the price.  I could spend almost all day there. Plenty of exhibits and sea creatures.  The outside veranda is a good spot to see  more kelp, wild sea otters, pelicans, star fish, birds, sea lions, etc.  I went there a long time ago and told my uncle all they are missing is some kind of turtle. And now they have them! I want to go back!"
2983,2017-04-08,4,"This aquarium is very well done. I strongly suggest getting there on a non-weekend day if you are able because on the weekend it can get quite packed. Having said that, there is enough space to get around and for the most part see everything you like. I will say that one of the most packed exhibits was the sea otter exhibit. Almost the entire day the windows were packed and became especially busy when they did the feeding. Every aquarium I have been to has plenty of space to see this exhibit except the Monterey aquarium. I took a star from this rating purely for this fact. It is one of my favorites, as with many people, and I think they should have known this in the design and either foreseen it then or fix it now. That may be expecting a lot, but for being that popular of an exhibit, it needs to be adjusted. Otherwise, the exhibits were clean and well displayed. The flow is nice. We also did the behind the scenes tour and it was worth the 15 dollars. Overall, great job! It is worth seeing and worth the money even though it's a little pricey. Oh and the food at the cafe is expensive. 12 bucks for a burger and fries."
2984,2014-05-07,5,"I love this place, best aquarium I've ever been too. The live kelp tank is by far my favorite, followed by the under the wharf tank. The prices are a little high but I understand the up keep must be expensive resulting in pricey tickets. You hoots love the historic cannery exterior of the place. Also if you have ever read john steinbecks cannery row, and wondered where the great tide pool that doc studied, it is outside the aquarium. Only way to see it is to buy a ticket to the aquarium."
2985,2016-03-13,5,"Beautiful, well kept Aquarium full of wonderful, educational experiences. My only complaint is about Rey, the penguin... watching him run through his area, dodging all the pairs of penguins to his destination of the dark corner with the access door saddened me. Please get Rey a mate. He seemed to be the only one alone in there and stayed in that corner for quite some time. Wonderful experience overall though."
2986,2011-08-17,4,"Very fun, but goodness it was busy the Friday we visited!Okay, to cut to the chase the parking business around the Aquarium is ridic - paying $15 is absolutely cray and there is no reason to do that peeps! Unless you have small children who can't handle walking, drive up the hill to the residential area and park for free (just read the street signs as some areas limit you to only 1 hour of free parking). As an added perk, you'll get a BEAUTIFUL view of the bay walking down to the aquarium from your car.I've been on an aquarium kick this summer having visited the LBC aquarium a couple months back. The MBA is beautiful and I loved seeing sea otters and sea lions on the rocks outside of the grounds, something you definitely don't see in Long Beach. The weather in Long Beach is nicer, especially if you prefer warm sunny weather over cold dreary fogginess 24-7. Also, the touch tanks at Long Beach win over MBA's given you can touch sharks (coooool!) and the bat ray touch tank is ginormous and clear, which means you can see the rays smiling at you (so freakin' cute!). Although the admission price is steep, I really felt like we got the most out of our money for everything we saw and the time we spent enjoying all the exhibits (~4.5 hours).Agreed there are a ton of kiddies running around, but that's to be expected, right? For parents, there are special kid-friendly play areas, which I thought was nice (though I stayed away from because they smelled like ish).Overall, the MBA wins slightly over LBC's aquarium due to its size (way larger) and better exhibits/fish population. Some of the fish we saw were just so impressive and prehistoric looking, it was quite a sight."
2987,2013-02-07,5,"What can you say about this place. Is it a pricey entrance? Yes. Who is making money off of it? The animals and the services that help those animals which you are going to view and enjoy. Phenomenal staff. Everyone friedly, helpful and really seem to enjoy their job. This is our second year as Ocean Advocate members and for the $250, if you get another couple to go in on it with you pays for itself after about 2 trips. The large lockers outside means you don't have to lug around everything you brought with you and if you pack a lunch to save a few bucks they have a great spot to eat lunch and watch the waves and marine life OUTSIDE the aquarium."
2988,2016-03-12,5,I highly recommend the year pass for locals because once you go you want to keep coming back with friends and family. Don't forget to check out the cuttlefish and the sea horses- sometimes the little guys are just as fascinating as the great white and the octopus!
2989,2013-12-01,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium was one of my favorite places to go as a kid, and it is still a pretty cool place to experience as an adult. I appreciate all the work they do to understand and help the local area, as well as the variety and uniqueness of the exhibits. Really the only thing that keeps me from making this 5 stars is the price. At $35 per it is in line with other world-class aquariums, but I feel like it is significantly more than when I first started going, although it has been a while. And to be fair, a student membership is $50, so it does pay back very quickly if you have the designation. Definitely worth a visit, even at the price."
2990,2013-08-11,5,"We moved to the Monterey Bay area in March and right away got the yearly pass that includes 2 guest passes for multiple uses. Wow, we have gone the last three weekends in a row with family and friends. It is a great place to go with people visiting the area. A must see!"
2991,2011-10-18,5,"I've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium at least 25 times in the last 20 years and every trip has been terrific! I've brought dates there, a girlfriend, a fiancee, and now our kids.This last time, we went for my son's birthday. The staff gave him a birthday button to wear and because they had time, they gave us a behind the scenes look at the jelly fish exhibit. I've always wondered what it looked like behind the tanks! They showed us how they care for and breed the jelly fish. Our guide, Lisa, was awesome!There's also a young great white shark in the Outer Bay exhibit. We've seen the other great whites at the aquarium in the past, and they're always fascinating to watch, but everyone still marvels at the huge sunfish.One interesting fact we learned is that some of the birds in the Sandy Shore exhibit are quite old.....20 years old! They're rescued birds and the aquarium rehabilitates and cares for them.Parking can be challenging since the aquarium doesn't have it's own, but there's plenty of public parking, so don't get too discouraged if you park a few blocks away. Take your time and take a stroll through Cannery Row!"
2992,2011-06-14,4,"Finally made it down here after living in SF for almost 3 years. Thought it was pretty great, although not quite as amazing as all the hype had led me to believe. We used to go to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach on a regular basis, and I had expected Monterey to completely blow it out of the water (so to speak). It was definitely bigger/better, but not by the quantum leap I was expecting. On the plus side, the staff was incredibly helpful/friendly/knowledgeable.  We spent a load of time chatting with the docents, who all seemed to really love what they were doing. We'll definitely be back.Also, otters!"
2993,2013-03-24,5,Simply Amazing! Check out the Open Water exhibit... its a must! I spent 2 hours just watching in aw of how mind blowing the open ocean can be.
2994,2014-03-16,5,I loved this place! It is fun for the whole family. I visited my brother in the service and I n his day off we went to see the fish! They have a lot to see and you could very easily spenf the entire day here! (:
2995,2014-03-14,2,"Way too much hype for the price. I heard great things about this aquarium and was told it's a must see. Well I was disappointed. I would have been more satisfied with paying $20 instead of $40.The exhibits are small and they really seem limited on wildlife. When I go to an aquarium I expect to see some larger sea life but here nothing was really amazing. You get the same experience at just about any other general aquarium. If you've already been to an aquarium before don't expect to get much out of this one.If anything it's probably great for kids but as an adult it's really just bland. It could be that I was spoiled when I went to Cancun and was able to experience much larger animals, I would say spend your money elsewhere."
2996,2011-06-10,3,"I don't know what it was about this place when I was younger, but I just did not have as much fun as I did when I came here with my elementary school field trips. First off, $30/person for an adult ticket. Are you kidding me? That alone was a turn off. The only reason why we shelled out $60 for the two of us to go to the aquarium is because we hadn't been here in years, and we thought, hey we're in Monterey, the aquarium is a must... right? Wrong.Yes, the exhibits are great, but the place is way too over crowded, over priced, and over exaggerated. To tell you the truth, the price alone made our experience ehhh not so much. I really just can't see myself shelling out $30 to go to an aquarium again. The exhibits were cool, but did make me a little dizzy with all the dim lights and concave glass. I guess I was just expecting a lot more for the price. I was pretty disappointed. I don't think we'll ever come back here unless we had kids that we wanted to take here. Until then, the Monterey Aquarium is way overrated. Sorry guys. Save the money and go snorkeling. You'll get a lot better experience with the fish."
2997,2016-03-27,5,We came to Monterey/ Carmel area for a visit and took the family to the aquarium for the day. Great variety of things to see and the grandkids loved the interactive stingray exhibit where they could touch the Rays.
2998,2014-01-07,5,"We've been members for two years and it's a fantastic place - highly recommended for kids. For tourists it could be tough to see the whole lot in a day, so you may have to review the map and select the attractions you really want to see. Alternatively, if you can afford it and have time during your stay, membership for a family is less than the cost of two visits."
2999,2011-09-05,4,"I loved it here.  I don't know what it is about aquariums, museums, etc. that make me feel like a kid on a field trip again.  There were many ""hands on"" type things which were pretty cool.  In the touch pools you could feel all different types of kelp and seaweed and the rays and skates.  Touching the rays was really cool, but the pool was kind of deep in spots (going two-thirds the way up our grown-up arms) so be careful if you have kids trying to reach in.  The jellyfish and seahorse exhibits were by far and away my favorite.  The aquarium does little seminars about every half hour in different parts of the facility.  While we were there they had a pengiun feeding, a deep sea exhibit, kelp forest lectures, etc.  Pretty cool for people of all ages."
3000,2011-08-01,5,"one of my all time favorite places.Jellyfish are magical.Seahorses, cute alien things oh my god - I could spend the day with them."
3001,2013-01-29,5,I loved the jellyfish and seahorse exhibits. You can probably finish going through the entire aquarium in under 2 hours if you're not with any kids.
3002,2016-01-01,5,"Great aquarium! Don't miss the sea otter feeding and catch a few of the 15 minute video presentations in the auditorium. It can get very crowded during peak times--school holidays especially, but still a very worthwhile experience."
3003,2013-12-31,4,"World class, but not cheap and parking can be a nightmare on busy days."
3004,2013-10-02,5,Best aquarium I've ever been! Everything was laid out easily for people to view. The exhibits we're professional and inviting. My husband and I came here on our first anniversary trip and it was so fun for us even though we don't even have any kids yet!
3005,2015-12-29,4,"first off, the drive to here was so beautiful!! It was pretty cool! it's four stars only because I thought it would be better than what people said it to be. but it's soooo worth the trip! my favorite part was the big tank where they had the hammer head sharks and huge tuna, also the cute sea otters!! and the different jelly fish they had! beautiful experience."
3006,2010-05-12,5,This aquarium is as good as it gets!  My wife and I went here over the Thanksgiving weekend of 2009 and had the time of our lives.  This place is fun for all ages.  So bring the kids and grandpa as well because everybody is going to have a wonderful experience at this magnificent aquarium.
3007,2011-04-09,5,"Sea otters, penguins, salmon, stingrays, and sharks all in the heart of beautiful Monterrey Bay... Need I say more?"
3008,2015-12-26,4,"Nice , a bit expensive for day pass. But joining as member helps if you always come in. But how may times you come in year. We became member to enjoy the unlimited visit for a year. It helps if you cannot finish the tour in one day. It's a cool place."
3009,2011-06-19,5,"This is probably the best aquarium that I've been to so far.The place is HUGE. There's so much to see that you really need to set aside a whole day of it. I've been here more than once and each time, I'm always fascinated by everything they have. Its very kid friendly, if you just make sure you don't lose 'em. Everything is well labeled and well lit so you're never confused. There's different types of exhibits, so sometimes you can touch, or see things right in front of you. Its a pretty cheap day, too.Take your sweet time when you're moving through. You won't be sorry."
3010,2013-07-19,5,GO! Wonderful experience. Just keeps going and going.  Great for all ages.  Had to pull the 4 year old out of the kids activity area at closing time.
3011,2013-09-24,5,Don't miss the Deep Sea feedings. Take advantage of the outdoor viewing area & telescopes. Saw a rare Dolphin; whale sightings occur regularly.
3012,2010-09-24,5,"What a difference it makes to come on a weekday! Came here on a Tuesday morning and it wasn't nearly as crowded as it usually here on weekends. The sad thing is that the Outer Bay (the huge tank with sharks, ginormous tuna, and other fish) was closed for renovations. Many hotels in the area offer a 2 day ticket for the price of 1. Take advantage of this if you stay in the area!I loved the new Seahorse exhibit!"
3013,2013-06-13,4,I loved the seahorses and the jellyfish! This place is beautiful! I love this aquarium! Its just the admission prices are too much...
3014,2012-07-24,5,"Loved it! We got a deal of 2 days for the price of one since we were staying the night at one of the local hotels. It was such a great deal. We checked in early and got our tickets and went to the Aquarium. We saw one half then left and came back when the Aquarium opened and finished the 2nd half. Totally awesome Octopus, jelly fish, and sea horse sections. But, we were in total AWE of the Open Sea. WOW!!!! We stayed there for a while. There is also seating up top. It was just fantastic. The Green Sea Turtles would come right up to you and stare you in the eye. Crazy good."
3015,2016-02-22,5,"My wife and I love the aquarium! We bought memberships as soon as we moved to the area, and we bring anyone who comes to visit us. All agree, the aquarium is well worth the visit!"
3016,2015-11-02,5,"Love the aquarium! This is the second time my family and I have been this year. The employees are always friendly and very informative, facilities clean and I absolutely love that they have a nursing station in bathroom. They also have baby changing tables in the men's and women's bathrooms. Best to go during off season when it isn't busy, it can get very busy and hard to get around with all the strollers. Loved the new tentacles exhibit. Will definitely be back!"
3017,2011-09-24,5,"Feels smaller as an adult but still a great family place or even for adults who want to see the ""wonder"" of the ocean.TIPS: AAA can buy discounted tix at their local offices and bypass the lines! Go on a weekday-- we went on a Friday, got there about noon and there were no lines.Felt like a few exhibits could use more room: sea turtles looked like they wanted a bigger tank, sea otter viewings are always tough but wished they could redo this so they could have more than 2 otters on display."
3018,2011-09-23,5,"Great place to bring kids to!! The jelly fish and the seahorses are amazing for adults. I love the programs try have about sustainable seafood. The info they give really helps out. I know the aquarium is trying to do their part for the environment. My only complaint is the crowds of people. But if you go on a weekday, it is much less crowded."
3019,2013-02-19,5,"came here on pres day.. expected it to be busy.. but mannn was it busy full of little kids & strollers... nonetheless.. i was pretty awed the wholetime.. more than i thought i could be.all the staff is so nice and knowledagble, and the set up is really amazing.its truly amazing what type of life exists out there that we barely know about!my favorite were the touching stations, and the feeding they have when a diver goes into the tank with the fish & feeds them!  Pretty cool, next time ill opt for a non holiday weekend.also its pretty pricey, and so is the food inside... but i dont mind contributing the $ to such an awesome place.. and look for deals too. we bought our tix from the hotel and it ended up being a 2 day pass, for the same price as a 1 day pass at the door... anddd we didnt have to wait in the huge line which was so nice, since it really was huge!"
3020,2011-12-19,4,"Otters! What's not to like about these delightful creatures? And the Monterey Bay Aquarium has some fine ones.We even liked the food! It's a bit pricey and pretty crowded, but well worth the trip."
3021,2011-01-01,4,"Though a bit pricey ($29.95 for adults, $27.95 for students), it isn't so bad when you consider how much they must spend on a daily basis to run this place.  I love the exhibits that they showcase in here, my favorite is the Monterey Bay Habitats that showcases the leopard sharks, bay ray, and the sevengill shark that they have swimming around in there.  Of course, they have over a dozen more creatures swimming in this 90 foot long aquarium, but these are my favorite. There are other exhibits that are also worth checking out like the sea otters, the kelp forest, sea horses, and the jellyfish exhibits.  After visiting this place, it makes me want to learn how to scuba dive.  But for now, this is as close as you can get to seeing them up close and personal.It may also be a good thing to point out that you should come in extra early to find parking around the area and avoid the crowd.  We arrive pleasantly early but by the time noon came around, the crowd was starting to get overwhelming."
3022,2013-08-15,3,"The exhibits are beautiful, but the sheer number of visitors makes it almost impossible to experience what they offer. They need security people there making sure everyone gets a turn to see."
3023,2013-06-08,5,Look for deals online if you're a AAA member you get $2 off. If you're a student they have special rates with ID
3024,2014-02-17,5,"We loved the otters. The aquarium only had two on display but they were playful and active when we were there. Make a point of watching the feeding - it's an excellent narrative on the otters with an educational slant - and get there 15 minutes prior to the feed time to get a good spot at the windows. Interestingly, we ended up coming at 12:30, which for an adult couple was a disaster. We walked a little and then got some drinks and came back at 4. This strategy is perfect for the weekend because when the aquarium isn't bonkers crowded you don't need more than 2 hours to see everything and most kids had left by 4. Beyond the otters we recommend seeing 1) the octopus 2) the jelly fish 3) petting the sting ray 4) penguins and 5) the great white shark show/movie. As an adult couple everything else is better done at Cal Academy Night Life as things can be done with drinks and obviously there are fewer kids to deal with."
3025,2013-07-10,5,THIS is the aquarium worth visiting in northern California. Do yourself a favor: purchase your tickets over the phone at least one day ahead of time and you'll skip the 30+ minute line to purchase tickets at the door. The sea otters were adorable and the jellyfish exhibit was fascinating.
3026,2015-12-13,5,"Tentacles exhibit was very interesting. I will never see calamari the same way again! Adorable creatures the octopus, squid, cuttlefish and nautilus. And the sea otters are our favs. And and the jellyfish. And....and! Got a two day pass and glad we did!"
3027,2010-05-17,5,"Going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium is always such a treat for me- Ithe $30 entrance fee is a bit on the pricey side, but you don't feel too bad paying it because its going towards funding further research.  I really can't say anything more that the previous 700 reviews have said, but I'll try- this is a great place to go for both adults and children.  The Outer Bay exhibit and the Kelp Forest exhibit are mesmerizing because there is so much to see and the otters are a delight to watch.  I'm a huge fan of the jellyfish exhibit just because the intense blue background of the tanks make the jellyfish stand out that much more (it also makes for great photos!) and everything just seems so otherworldly.  The ""new"" seahorse exhibit and the flamingos exhibit are also fun and I like how they have kiosks set up so that you can send a virtual postcard to your congressperson to encourage them to be more supportive of environmental causes (I think this is especially important in the wake of the BP Gulf Coast oil disaster.)All in all, the aquarium makes for a great visit for anyone.  I'm seriously considering becoming a member although it is a far drive just because the exhibits are so amazing."
3028,2013-06-03,4,"We had a blast here. I haven't been here since I was 10 and the place has totally been revamped. My kids had a blast running through all the exhibits and seeing all the different type of marin wild life. We came right at opening and were able to walk through the majority of things before it got really busy, you could tell when we started to leave it was going to be a mad house. The staff is great about helping and very knowledgeable, the kids loved the splash zone and areas where they were allowed to touch things. The price per ticket is a bit expensive, but I think it's worth it. Go in walk around, get a stamp to come back, tour Cannery Row eat lunch and head back in later on..It's a great experience that every kid should have."
3029,2015-10-22,5,"Amazing. Beyond beautiful. Clean, family friendly. Worth the money. It's a must to do while in Monterey. It was the best aquarium we have been to."
3030,2010-12-04,5,"If I really took the time to walk the entire length of the aquarium at a child's imagination's pace, I would never get out. Their primary focus on the greater California coast makes this an enchanting experience; an experience that sends your soul to the waters right off our coast.No really, I think they got me pretending to be that tuna swimming in a blue tinted oblivion, avoiding predators and feeding on prey. Yeah, I was there."
3031,2011-09-11,5,"I came here with my girlfriend on Labor Day weekend, and boy was it crowded. But it offered a lot of interesting exhibits and stunning views. I especially enjoyed the interactive exhibits. Their were a lot of children running around unsupervised which isn't entirely the aquariums fault, but parents really need to keep an eye on their kids, I had several run into me and some were attempting to crawl on top of the exhibits.I liked the stingray and sea horse exhibits."
3032,2013-08-04,5,"My family took a day trip down to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the place was great! Loved it..."
3033,2011-02-04,4,"Great place to take your family, especially if you have young kids. They have alot of different interactive exhibits here where you can touch the manta rays and pet the starfish and do all kinds of other things. The first time I came here was when I was about 13 years old, and I remember it being a fun experience.As an adult, it's still a nice place to come but at times you feel like there's just way too many kids around. It's almost like Disneyland but in a more enclosed area. I love kids, but when it's super packed and there's children running around everywhere it can get a little irritating.My favorite exhibits were the sea otters and the jellyfish. This place has a bigger variety of jellyfish than i've seen at any other aquarium. We tried touching the manta rays but they were staying away from the edges of the pool. I'm guessing it's because it was the end of the day and they were tired of being handled by tourists. The seahorses were pretty fun to watch, too. The aquarium is a bit expensive, but I'm sure all of my money is going towards conservation efforts and maintaining the aquarium, so I guess it's okay. If you don't have kids, the aquarium is probably doable in 2-3 hours. We got here at 3:30pm when they closed at 6pm, and we even left a little before closing having felt like we saw just about everything."
3034,2013-09-02,3,"Just went yesterday, 9/1/12. Got there at 10 and they open at 9:30.. The line was ridiculous but it went by fast. It was too crowded! I recommend not going on a holiday... Or the weekend. I suggest that this is more of a family/kid place. Lots of strollers and kids. Even a kid play area upstairs .. Had kids myself so it was alright. Just too many people and stupid people who stand in the middle of the walk way charting it up. Move over people! It's a walk way and you are holding up traffic!!"
3035,2015-11-24,1,"Incompetent managers, great aquarium. Made us wait in the rain for 40 min because their computers weren't working right when the lobby was empty. Where's some California problem solving when you need it?"
3036,2010-06-14,5,"Learning has never been so fun. The exhibits are fascinating; the hands-on stations are genuinely intriguing; facilities are clean; and staff are well informed. I loved The Secret Lives of Seahorses, the charismatic penguins, the touch pool, and of course the otters. Couple of tips:- I would honestly suggest taking children 3 and up. I think our 2 year old nephew didn't get a chance to fully appreciate it. - Buy tickets on craigslist. Adult admissions is $29.95 (as of today) plus tax and you can find guest passes on craigslist for as low as $15.00 if you're lucky- Ask for a schedule; there are some really awesome daily events such as the penguin, otter, and shark feedings.- If you're wondering how much time you can spend at the aquarium, I'd say about 3 hours."
3037,2010-06-06,5,"OMG!  I want to go back...NOW!I haven't been there for at least ten years.  It's amazing what private donations and creative planning can do in that amount of time!Took the family here during Memorial Day weekend.  Even after four hours, I knew there were parts of the aquarium we still missed.  We were all exhausted with all of the walking, but certainly enjoyed every minute.Pros: EVERYTHING!  Seahorse exhibit, jellyfish exhibit, penguin feeding show, the giant tank with the different kinds of fishing swimming next to each other (sharks, stingrays, sardines, salmon, etc), interactive computers, interactive learning area specifically for kids, etc.  There always seemed to be a bathroom nearby when you really needed one.Cons: Nothing, really.  Tips: Pack a lunch and eat it nearby to save $$$.  There are many places within a few blocks to sit and relax.  I think we all know that ""museum"" food is always costly.If you have an AAA membership, they have discounted tickets for adults and kids.Planning an overnight trip?  Suggest staying in the Salinas area (30 minutes away).  Hotels are less expensive and have more available rooms.Park near residential homes.  If you don't see meters or signs stating a specific parking time, you can park there as long as you want.  Most of the closest lots are $20 and normally full by noon.  Bring a lot of quarters if you're going to chance on the meters.The gift shop has standard stuff.  Be picky.  There are two on the first floor - a general one and one geared more towards kids."
3038,2015-07-14,5,"OMG, this place is so magical and incredible and the overall staff is so kind, warm and friendly. They do such a magnificent job of displaying the amazing sea animals and educating the public. So wish they were closer to where we live. Would visit every weekend if I could!!!"
3039,2013-04-15,5,"I love this aquarium! I have been here a handful of times & I make it a point to come every time I visit! I live in Florida & have been to the aquariums here, Miami & Tampa even Atlanta. This one is impressive by far. My favorite part is outside where you can watch the animals in their natural habitat. I love that they have an area for kids where you can touch and pet the sea life. I just love the exhibits not to mention I didn't feel rushed to look at the exhibits, there was plenty of room for everybody! If you are in the area you should really stop in & take a stroll on the avenue when you are done. The area is beautiful but make sure you bring a sweater because when the sun starts to set the temperature drops!"
3040,2010-09-17,5,"If you're in the Monterey Area, the aquarium should be one of your hot spots to visit. Surrounding the aquarium area are Cannery Row, the 17 Mile Hike/Drive, Pebble Beach and if you're into camping, you can check out Big Sur which is also nearby.Be aware this place is always packed with long zig zagging lines of tourists day in and day out. When stepping in, you're walking into an ocean of people looking at fish, mammals and other various sea creatures congregating and coexisting on the other side of a huge wall of clear dense glass. You don't have to be walking around the aquarium to see all the wild life either. Monterey Bay Aquarium also resides at the end of Monterey Canyon, an under water canyon which makes the abover water Grand Canyon look like a crevice. You can step outside to have a picnic lunch with friends/family while looking at the great scenery of ocean. I closed my eyes for a moment. I could heard the stampede of rolling ocean crashing against the rocks, smell the sour salty ocean air, hear the distressed crying of sea gulls and feel the refreshing breeze from the coastal winds. I wish I could live out here and away from the city more often. I don't miss seeing street lights, hearing sirens all day long or smelling horrible body odors on a cramped bus. I miss nature. Coming to the Aquarium helped me relax, clear my brain and made my eyes grow into the size of dinner plates when a huge shark swam right past me as I pressed my face against the glass."
3041,2013-11-13,5,"Love this place! It never ceases to amaze me. I really like that they make an effort to educate you about taking care of our oceans and those who live in it. Whenever I visit, no matter how many times I've been, I always sit in complete amazement. Also, watching the sea otters is always a real treat."
3042,2013-06-08,5,"Beautiful experience! The jelly fish exhibit was fantastic and I got to touch a manta ray.=) Excellent food in the cafe and you know a place is awesome when they have Tapatio, Siracha and Cholula as part of the condiments stand. A lot of neat little tchotchkes in the gift shop with the staff being so friendly. I took so many lovely pictures of the fish, sharks and other marine life (be nice and DON'T USE FLASH!) and the octopus was the biggest ham and posed for every shot I took of him. The staff said that he usually doesn't come out to the front of the tank. Go there take your friends, family and little ones it's an awesome experience.  They are open every day except Christmas and they let you go out and come back in  as long as you have your hand stamped. GO!"
3043,2010-12-22,5,"Nature in a museum. It doesn't get any better than this. Add on the ocean research based from this place and you have a world class outfit strutting their stuff. I come here about once a year, or more often if I have out of state visitors. Two springs ago my sister and I were eating in a seafood (!) restaurant and we had window seats looking over the bay. I saw a whale come up and exhale, which I believe is called spouting. The whale kept going north, and my sister and we got a demonstration of naturals in nature. The whale (I hesitate to say he or she) went on and we saw about 15 spouts. I will never forget it."
3044,2015-07-07,5,"everything about it was perfect, love the otters and the school fish, and their work attendants were very knowledgeable"
3045,2015-09-19,4,Joined the aquarium. Great jellyfish exhibit and a really nice aquarium. Welcoming place.
3046,2014-07-05,4,"Coming here makes me feel like a kid all over again! Such an amazing place to bring your family and have an educational day. There's a lot to do and see, the only downside is that it's incredibly crowded. I feel like regardless what day you go, it'll always be busy. But then again, that shouldn't stop you. There are also shows in the auditorium that are available for everyone to attend. The average time I finished walking the whole auditorium with no shows and just looking at the animals went somewhere from 2-3 hours. So expect atleast 5 or so hours if you want a few shows and watch the staff feed the animals."
3047,2009-10-14,5,"ME:  I can't believe the Monterey Bay Aquarium makes that guy stand out on Cannery Row dressed like a big shrimp.  John Steinbeck is rolling over in his fucking grave right now.HIM:  Um, that's not the Monterey Bay Aquarium, that's the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company.ME:  Really?HIM:  Really.ME:  Wow.  That shit actually exists?HIM:  Yeah.ME:  Wow.HIM:  I know.

3048,2010-08-14,5,"I think my deep obsession with marine life is rooted in the fact that I am also terribly afraid of the ocean. We are mystified by the unknown, and taunted by our fears. However, aquariums are able to bring this alien world on our planet up close for us to see. I've been a member with the aquarium for the last 12 years, and it never disappoints. I can stand at any of the larger tanks and just watch and watch and watch as people come and go. It's so much more pleasant coming on a weekday during non-peak times when there aren't as many little kids running around and screaming/crying. However, I do think it's a great place to bring children to spark their interest in conservation and marine wildlife. The aquarium does a superb job with making conservation accessible and fun.Even without membership, the general admission tickets are well worth the price for all the wonderful exhibits and helpful/knowledgeable staff and volunteers. It's really clean and well maintained."
3049,2010-11-01,5,"I haven't been here since I was a little kid and it's safe to say that my fond childhood memories are now replaced with fond adulthood memories.. The price of admission is worth the Sea Otter exhibit and view of the bay alone but their other attractions make the afternoon here in Monterey worth while.. My girlfriend and I definitely had a great time and the icing on the cake is the supposed money that goes into sealife preservation.. Just one look at an otter and you'll have to have a black, empty soul not to donate!"
3050,2011-08-09,4,"By far the best aquarium I've been to. Highly recommended!But, if you want to take your stroller seating child, I suggest not to come here during the summer. He or she won't be able to see anything pass the rude adults who try swoop on you while you're patiently waiting for the view of the large tanks."
3051,2010-08-30,5,"I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE!!I've been to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach but it doesn't even compare to this place! Filled with thousands of gorgeous fish, sea horses, jelly fish, sting rays (bat rays) and most of all... THE ADORABLE CUTE SEA OTTERS!! AWWWWW!! Tons of shows and performances go on every 30-60 minutes, trust me, they're all EXTREMELY entertaining!The size of some of these tanks took my breath away.. I can't express how beautiful everything was, especially the huge jelly fish with it's vibrant orange/pink color against the deep jewel blue water. Stunning I tell you! OH and also, being able to touch the velvety smooth skin of a bat ray is an indescribable experience I tell you!Downside is that it is always packed full of people since it IS famous after all. Last time I was there, they held a wine tasting and a small jazz concert towards closing time and kept the place open for an extra 2 hours!"
3052,2009-05-20,5,"The male seahorse, rather than the female, becomes pregnant. This unusual mode of pro-creation is the most extreme form of male parental care in the world.The female inserts her ovipositor (the va-jay-jay) into the male's brood pouch, where she deposits her eggs, which the male fertilizes. The fertilized eggs then embed in the pouch wall and become enveloped with tissues. The pouch acts like the womb of a female mammal, complete with a placental fluid that bathes the eggs, and provides nutrients and oxygen to the developing embryos while removing waste products. The pouch fluid is altered during pregnancy from being similar to body fluids to being more like the surrounding seawater. This helps reduce the stress of the offspring at birth. HA!!!Five stars because we knew nothing about sea horse reproduction.I think she was interested on knocking me up on the first date!  =)"
3053,2010-01-06,5,"Much as I'd love to brag about my own town's aquarium, pitting Long Beach's so-called ""Aquarium of the Pacific"" against any medium to large city, to do so against Monterey would be analogous to comparing a bathtub to an ocean. It had been years since my last visit and when our innkeeper handed use two free tickets, I was all set for a simple relook at old stuff. Was I ever so wrong and I bow my head in shame. I must have looked the town fool sporting a silly grin all day long but my mind was blown as I studied one exhibit after another, each more awesome than the previous. The excited ""Look at THIS!"" and ""Oh wow, check THIS out!"" of the tidal basin, shore bird display, anemones, jellies, seals, otters and the sea horses gave way to stunned church-like silence when we got to the big Outer Bay exhibit. Sharks, great big sharks of the kind I imagine swimming below me while I surf cruised this ""open ocean"" tank as confidently and casually as the schools of sardines, mackerels, bass and ""WTF was THAT?"" No shit, a Yellowfin tuna! Here were several fully grown tuna a sashimi chef would love to slice down to $20 bites kicking their tails with little effort at all to jet them across this enormous bucket. I understood when the little kid next to me pasted his face and hands to the surface and screamed a ""Did you see THAT?"" My attempts to photograph them left me with fuzzy images of something streamlined and rocket fast ...Discreetly posted warnings of over fishing, pollution effects and the need for conservation inform all but the most ignorant why it's so critical to understand how every one of us has an impact on the ocean and if we continue with the same gusto as years previous, may soon lose what we today take for granted. Here is a site you can learn how choices we make affect the world around us...http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/seafoodwatch.aspxEven simply saying ""No"" to a fish dinner is the wrong answer.  A list of recommended alternatives or what you can choose instead of that over fished product is also available on the same site.As an incredibly exciting attraction or a highly effective educational tool, this aquarium rocks the boat of what an ocean exhibit should be. Long Beach has some mighty big boots to fill before they can vie with Monterey."
3054,2008-03-11,4,"I have been very, very busy at work lately. So busy that I didn't even have time to stay the night in Monterey on my first ever visit to the seaside town. So busy that I do not have time to write a useful, funny and cool review of this place. So what does a busy person do in these situations? Steal someone else's review and update it accordingly, duh! So here is my hijacked review, as accurately depicted as possible without actually writing it myself, and isn't it fitting that I committed the evil act of plagiarizing for my 666th review. I've been to the aquarium one time and I enjoyed it. Recently, I had the pleasure of taking a day trip down to Monterey to ogle at the various wildlife presented by the Monterey Bay Aquarium with a wonderful man. We made it there in decent time from SF, despite the weather and my nearly failed attempt at a gas station refill. Mental note: when filling a tank, once you squeeze the pump handle check there is a flow of gas, or you will start to drive away wondering why in the hell your gas bill was $20 more than usual while your tank is still on empty. On to the aquarium itself!The jellyfish are amazing in their alien form and body. The aquarium has done a wonderful job of putting these critters on display. The otters are pretty difficult to watch during feeding time on the weekend, owing to the crowds. The massive swarm of sardines isn't quite as breathtaking the nth time around, but since it was my first time here they were pretty cool... and so were the coral fish. And I dug the beach tide exhibit.We got an unexpected giggle out of watching a spiny king crab terrorize the shrimp in its tank, causing hasty retreats from the crab's spindly and poky legs. It made me want to keep an aquarium of my own with a spiny king crab, so I watch various other smaller critters run away whenever I wanted.I can't fault the aquarium, but I would like to since I have never seen the penguin exhibit, but the Penguin attraction was closed for renovations. I believe that this is re-opening very shortly, but it highlights a particular point-- if there's something that you're especially keen on seeing, it would be a good idea to check the aquarium's website to make sure it's open. There aren't too many different attractions / areas, and while most host a variety of creatures in individual tanks, some are single, large tanks with a large host of creatures. Had I done this, I would have also known that the great white shark had already been released.Unfortunately, the ""Sandy Shore"", is in need of some attention. I adore bat rays, but all were cowering in a corner of their pool, I suspect owing to the number of little hands splashing the water. Since they live in a touching pool, I don't know exactly how one could remedy that situation-- it would drive any curator bat-ray-shit crazy to ask a thousand children a day to not splash the waters. But the bat rays looked like they had no intention of coming anywhere within reach of a human hand, and I can't blame them.At any rate, the aquarium does seem smaller than imagined. One possible reason for this feeling during my visit it was a rainy day, so we couldn't readily bop outside to watch the ocean waves and stroll around. I hear the location is one of the highlights of the aquarium, and should be enjoyed.What made my day exemplary, of course, was the company I kept. He makes going to the grocery store fun, but going to the aquarium and making out in dark corners between looking at fish is a blast. The aquarium makes for a romantic and simple date, and, I have heard, is certainly better with friends or family than alone, so thank you to him for accompanying me."
3055,2009-10-02,4,"I'd like to be...under the sea...in an octopuses garden in the shade....Less of an educational aquarium (not enough little information plaques for my taste) and more of an underwater fantasy world. Before coming to this aquarium I never considered architecture or interior design to be integral to a museum; now I do. Everything in here makes you ooohhh and ahhhhh in a delightful way.I don't know much more about jelly fish or seahorses due to my trip to this aquarium but I do know that I would like to have a few as pets that could double as wall decorations. What a conversation piece!If you're in the area you should definitely shell out the $30 to visit this place. Think of it more as a ride than an aquarium and you'll be happy. You can also part with your money a little easier knowing that the Monterey Bay Aquarium is committed to promoting conservation. Be sure to grab a ""safe fish guide"" on your way out so you can make better decisions when dining out and you don't end up eating the last piece of blue fin tuna on the planet. And, I implore you, for the love of little plaques, please read them, and then follow their instructions to not use flash photography. If your camera flashes and you scare the fish then it ruins it for everyone. You selfish, endangered species eating, bastard....Ahem. I like the aquarium."
3056,2013-08-05,5,"How come Yelp only goes up to 5 stars.....'cause the Monterey Bay Aquarium deserves SIX!  Takes a lot to blow me away with anything in life, but this sure came close.  The marine life is spectacular, of course, but they are what they are, and the experience may be unfairly dictated by what they happened to be doing (or not) at the time.  So, it's not like I hadn't seen anything I hadn't before (having lived near the beach most of my life).....although the jellyfish the size of a head of a pencil was a first and completely mind-blowing (helped along by a very apropos soundtrack of Jimi Hendrix in the background and 60's decor to perfectly complement!).No, these stars are given mostly for the obvious care and concern of those who created and operate the Aquarium.  From the way they, literally, immerse you into the marine environment....to the over-abundance of docents and guides that not only passively help and inform, but actively ensure your experience is top-notch (eg:  if we stopped for even a couple seconds to look at our map, a worker was right there to ask if we needed help; or the docent out on the deck who immediately offered us binoculars to catch a pod of whales who happened to be in the bay at the time).I really don't know what this place could do more to make your visit better.  Funny how someone earlier compared it to Disneyland (in an unflattering way).  But really, the MBA is truly the Disney of aquariums."
3057,2008-03-03,4,"It feels like it was just yesterday that I came here as a 4th grader. Next thing I know, I'm a chaperone for a group of 5th graders! However, not too much has changed for me since the time I was there as a kid:- While eating lunch outside of the aquarium, enjoying the beautiful ocean view, a kamikaze seagull snatched a cookie right out of my fingers as I was about to take a bite. That stealthy bugger did it so fast that I couldn't wrestle it away with my kung fu grip! I cried, like I did when the little boy who yanked my ponytail, took my Hostess Cupcake and ran away in 4th grade. - During the sea otter feeding (which only happens 3 times a day for 15 minutes), I had to stand on my tippy-toes to get a glance at the otters in the tank. After a couple minutes, I gave up and resorted to watching it on the plasma tv. Adults are so selfish, getting there super early and standing up front! The poor little kids had to crawl through their legs to get up to the window to see. Yeah, so I'm pretty much the same height I was in 4th grade. - The kids splashing around in the touch pool still freak me out. Be gentle! The kids were about to jump into the pool and grab a bat ray - why do you think they're swimming all the way on the other end? At least the volunteers are pretty attentive. And now they have a hand sanitizer dispenser and towels so you can clean your hands.- I still haven't seen the penguins. Where are those cute little guys?Ah, the memories. Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of those places that is always fun for kids and remains fascinating for adults. Just beware of the seagulls, they have no fear! Don't say I didn't warn you!"
3058,2007-11-28,5,"Tiger Woods got me kicked out of the Monterey Aquarium.I was reminded of that true story this weekend when my wife and I brought the kids down for our annual visit. The sea-life, staff and pretty much all the exhibits here are mind blowing as usual, so I am reminded why it's so popular. Unfortunately it IS so popular, so days like the Saturday after Thanksgiving make for big crowds and the accompanying panicky feeling you get when your little kids stray more than a foot from your side. Still, it's an amazing place and I'd love to find a quiet time to just sit mesmerized in front of the gigantic Outer Reef tank or in the jellyfish area for an hour or two, maybe with a glass of pinot in hand.  Which brings my back to my other story...So it's 1995, I'm a senior in college and the fraternity (yes, I was in one, let's move on) has been scrounging up party funds all semester for a blow-out spring formal at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  This is an extraordinarily high end effort for us, since we usually dine at Taco Bell and drink from warmish kegs of Natural Light. Anyway, we've rented out part of the aquarium for a catered dinner and we're all excited about the big event. My future wife and I arrive at the formal and we're just settling into our (legal) glasses of wine in front of the otter tank when we're told that the event has been cancelled and we all have to leave. ""What?!"" we all ask incredulously... but despite a series of escalating pleas, complaints and threats, security comes and ushers us all out. As it turns out, a couple of underage pledges - including one 18 year old Tiger Woods - have been boozing it up in the bathrooms and, when caught by aquarium security, get drunkenly belligerent. So that's it, aquarium staff is uninterested in giving us more chances to get into trouble and the party's over before it starts. And so my opportunity to sip wine uninterrupted with the sharks has passed me by for a decade and change, but I'm still hoping Tiger's going to reappear one day and invite the old guard back for a little aquarium reunion. I'm not exactly holding my breath though.Meanwhile, I'll keep enjoying the annual pilgrimage with my little guys and just relish their awe of the jellyfish, fascination with the white shark and screams of delight under the rushing tide pool exhibit."
3059,2009-07-31,5,"I hafta admit...I am absolutely, positively OBSESSED with aquariums! I'm one of those people who could sit around and watch fish swim all day. Throw in a shark, and I'm good for hours...Anyway, out of all of the aquariums I've been to, Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of my favorites! (That, and the one at Mandalay Bay in Vegas.) It has SO MUCH STUFF that I always get lost when I go. I went a few months ago with a little cousin, and I tried to take her to see the penguins, but we failed. I ended up having to buy her a penguin stuffed animal =/Wait...getting back on track: the aquarium offers an amazing view of the ocean. Go outside and walk around. You'll see what I mean. I don't know what's better - standing outside enjoying the view, or looking at the gazillion tanks of sea creatures. Okayyy I'm still slightly inebriated so I'm off to bed! Goodnight, Yelpers.**EDIT: Really?? WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYSELF?  I really do love this place, though =)"
3060,2011-05-27,5,"PRO:-new, clean, organized-lots of explore and learn-penguins are so cute-lots of areas where you can touch some sea creatures-an outdoor section where you see birds hanging out-located at the end of Cannery Row, which has many great restaurants and shops to browse throughCON:-layout is a little confusing-come on a weekday to avoid the crowds-parking garage is a few blocks away from actual aquarium, so wear come comfortable shoes-admission seems expensive to me, but they do have a wonderful sea creature collection, such gorgeous animals."
3061,2013-05-24,5,"I have been to many aquariums and this is one of the best.  Monterey Bay Aquarium really shines with great displays, very informative shows/feedings in a beautiful setting."
3062,2008-03-08,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is mesmerizing! Outer Bay Exhibit - Standing in a darkened room with big and small fish swimming all around gives you a sense of awe for all that exists in our vast ocean. The jellyfish are graceful as they glide and swoosh across the tanks. Beautiful and transparent. I couldn't stop watching them.Sea Otters - I love watching the playful sea otters swim about and appeal to the crowd. You have to watch their feeding exhibit. The sea otters are trained to do behaviors like touch their hands to the back wall or swim to one of the windows in exchange for food.River Otters - These otters are so much more active than the sea otters. They are constantly jumping in and out of the water and trying to tease each other into a fight. The octopus is extremely shy and it takes a lot of food and coaxing to get it out of the corner.A lot more exhibits to see and experience, the above were my top favorites.The tickets are $24.95 for adults, but well worth the money spent. The money goes toward the upkeep of this awesome Aquarium, education programs, conservation, and research for the Monterey Bay and beyond."
3063,2007-08-10,4,"Lets play my favorite game. It's called two truths and a lie. I'll go first.1.) I stole an otter from the aquarium, named it Earl, made a home for it in my kitchen sink, and feed it canned sardines, fruit roll-ups, and Pez.2.) I sucker punched a child after he shoved his grimy little hands into my cushiony ass to move me aside while he tried to get a clear view of the Sunfish....the most hideously deformed and frightening fish of all kind.3.) Spending all day at the aquarium watching beautiful Jellyfish flit about, penguins waddle lovingly to their keepers, giant tuna flash in front of my wide eyes, and bat rays glide effortlessly about, made me drool and declare I wanted sushi for dinner.If you guessed #2, you were right! That kid wishes he never put his hands on my body, because the day you try to push Sassy's badonkadonk out of the way is the day you wish you'd stayed home with your transformers and Ketchup slathered Easy Mac. Kids are gross! That little booger is probably the reason I've been hacking up green phlegm wads all week.The aquarium is magical and would be even more so if they enforced a child leash law. Oh my god! I'm totally kidding. Not really.  But, no, I am. Not."
3064,2015-07-31,5,Always a fun place to visit.  My kids love the burgers at the restaurant. Looking forward to a new exhibit next year!!
3065,2013-09-07,4,"The Aqaurium is relatively small and perfect for small children. It is easily manageable for short attention spans. Great hands-on area upstairs in ""splash town."""
3066,2010-05-07,5,"From the educational aspects to the layout to the actual wildlife it showcases, the place is great. I went to see the jellyfish exhibition which had been there for 4 years; I missed it by months! but no matter, they have a permanent jellie exhibit which was fascinating. They also have a jellie film and 'lecture' which ran twice during our 4 hour visit.We watched the otters feed-  those things are almost as cute as my dogs. They're adorable and though mean-  they look super sweet and cuddly. lots of 'aaaaahhhhhh' factor there.The volunteers  -  there are over a 1000, evidently - were all helpful and the old men were all corny jokesters just waiting for a chance to slip in their time worn jokes. But it was all very charming.The atmosphere is wonderful -  because you're on the bay, the elements of real ocean and exhibit are blended together well. Also the educational aspects are plentiful and that's so important when you realize how many people simply aren't aware of how their lives and habits impact nature.They allow free school field trips and this is the only bummer-  the place mid-day on a Thursday was jam packed with large groups of kids. I like kids but in large groups- well you know, they're brats in and unruly. It was a drawback.Sealife is amazing. Beautiful, complicated, simple, and ugly all @ the same time  (there are some ugly @ss fish in the sea. there are amazingly beautiful starfish and coral and jelly fish) And we're messing with it.  This aquarium educates and entertains and also says that a portion of the almost $30 admission will go to some helpful ocean cause. It's all good"
3067,2013-05-20,5,"Best place ever. Amazing staff, volunteers and their mission is awesome. Great one-on-one help and service. Just a great place!"
3068,2010-07-27,5,"I volunteer here every other Saturday but I live in Mountain View. That's how much I love this place. And I am not the only one - there are others who live further away from Monterey than me and would come down here to volunteer. My favorite ""stations"" to work at: the touch pools, the outer bay exhibit (people always ask about the great white sharks, and the answer is we don't have any at the moment) and last but not least: the jellies.Touch pools: this is where you can feel the different ""texture"" each star fish has. Some have rough skin to protect them, and the others (such as leather stars) release a garlicky smell so no one in the ocean wants to eat them. I love how the kids' faces just light up after they feel how mushy the sea cucumbers are, too. First time experience is the best!The Outer Bay Exhibit: there are just so many cool fish there - the gigantic tuna, hammer heads, dolphin fish (a.k.a. ""mahi mahi""), and more. They recently placed thousands of sardines in the tank too. It's really just fun watching these fish.Jellies: these guys are my fav. They are just beautiful. I can get lost drifting with them. This jelly fish guru guy, Chad Widmer, is apparently very good at what he does. Folks from other aquariums in the world come here to consult him about how to keep the jellies alive in the aquarium.Did you know there are currently over 1,000 active volunteers working the floors (on different shifts of course)? And there's a waiting list if you want to become a diver to scrub the fish tanks for them? Why? Because this place is just awesome!"
3069,2011-03-15,4,"I've been looking forward to visiting this aquarium For-ev-er! And I'm glad I checked it out. I LOVED the seahorses, the little fishies everywhere, the silly sea otters, the indoor/outdoor experience.My biggest and angriest hangup? The ""touch"" exhibits. I absolutely disdain and find it revolting that we're allowed to touch ANY of the poor sea creatures. I felt sick to my stomach watching the Bat Rays trying to huddle away from the humans or commit suicide by beaching themselves on the rocks. Why, why, why? I wish I wouldn't have come to that part because it makes me sick, sick, sick.On a high note, though, it was neat to be up close and personal to some beach birds (except for one distraught bird with a broken wing that seemed to try to find it's way through the glass window as it was calling for friends to help it get out.) Actually, to be so up close and personal with ALL the life there was astounding (although, depressing at the same time).Pretty cool place despite my dislike of trapped animals on display - but this icky-feeling was over-ridden knowing that most animals are in rehabilitation or are ""use to"" a life of living in a glass bowl.Seahorses, again, amazing! I could have sat all day and stared at them."
3070,2010-07-31,2,"I really hate to be writing this review, but after a long conversation with my young teen boys and husband after our visit, we all concur, we've seen better. Family of 4 (2-adults, 2-children) = $107 with $2/person discount applied. 4 hours in the aquarium. The crowds of people milling about, people shoving and pushing, no consideration made for people in wheelchairs or physically disabled (which really galled me), faces smashed up against the viewing windows, cameras pushed to the glass, flashes going off even when there are signs in several languages including the universal picture saying ""NO FLASH"" in certain areas, combined with a rather useless map of the aquarium* made this less than enjoyable. It would have been so much more helpful if there was a way to move people from one exhibit to another and portion out the visitors at each exhibit so that it could have been more enjoyable. (* montereybayaquarium.org/…) The touch pools were (almost) all the same. Starfish that you couldn't even pick up and look at to explore the undersides of these creatures (yes, we understand they are like any other living thing and can only take so much manhandling before their system goes into overload - so why not be aware of this and rotate out the creatures so that we're not hearing volunteers spit out ""DON'T DO THAT!""?) and a plethora of kelp. Wee. Even  the far more commercialized Sea World has a better system in place so that people can explore. The manta rays were cute, begging to be touched as they would rise up out of the water looking for hands to rub up against, but there wasn't anyone around explaining to the visitors about these creatures. The large tanks with hammerhead sharks, huge tuna, and other large fish were okay, but we longed for the truly immersing experience such as what we found at a smaller aquarium that rivals MBA, in our opinion, the Oregon Aquarium where you walk ""into"" the tanks. For very small kids, there were lots of expensive, extravagant, interactive areas to play and learn in, but for the older kids, such as our 14-year-old boys, they wanted more of the hands-on that was only mildly offered in the Mission to the Deep room that explored remote underwater exploration. Sadly, we were not impressed and didn't feel that the expense of nearly $25/person was worth the trip."
3071,2007-07-05,1,"I hate you so much, Monterey Bay Aquarium. $55 bought me the opportunity to watch thousands of screaming children yelling ""look at this one!"" over and over. There were some cute otters sleeping in a tiny plexiglass pond and one particularly ferocious brat loudly announced its plans to wake them up with flash photography. I quickly came to the conclusions that that 1. Kids were only interested in the novel ""weirdness"" of various animals, and 2. Adults were only interested in taking pictures of the weird animals, and 3. Old people are freakishly mesmerized by the ""history of canning animal pieces"" exhibit.After an hour of trying to strategetically avoid various school tours, me and my boyfriend left in exasparation. For the whole car ride home and about a week thereafter, I loudly declared how much the experience made me want to get a hysterectomy.PS. Animal cruelty alert! The penguins housed in ""Splash Zone"" have it worse than I've seen in awhile. It actually made my boyfriend cry. They had a tiny tank (much shallower than the one at the SF Zoo) and a fake sky painted onto the ceiling. That's right, they don't even get to see the LIGHT OF DAY."
3072,2008-01-02,5,"Being charter members of the aquarium, we believe strongly in supporting their research and development via our annual membership.  We've been going to the aquarium since they opened in the mid-80s as a family and via field trips when our son was in school.Being members means never having to wait in the very LONG lines that snake out the front entrance of the aquarium.  The members entrance is located to the far right of the aquarium, of which you can also purchase your membership here and waltz right in.The aquarium has not disappointed us in the least.  There are always new rotating exhibits that teach all (adults and children alike).  I never tire of going here although I prefer to go when it's not crowded so we choose our visits accordingly.One of the most memorable visits was when they had the first great white shark in the outer bay tank...simply breath taking....The membership pays for itself after two visits and you'll be helping out a great organization.  Check out the website for more detailed information and you'll be able to plan your visit accordingly."
3073,2008-06-23,4,"I hadn't been to this aquarium in over 10 years and was amazed at how it has changed and pleased that some things remained the same. We had a great time watching the otters, penguins and fishies. I think I fell a little bit in love with a blue billed duck and was jealous of the gorgeous legs on a stilt bird. I got to touch a sea cucumber for the first time and was impressed at the young teenage boy who knew so much about the creatures he was supervising. What I didn't like were the crowds yesterday and the lack of personal space people remember to give to others. We had a snack at the cafe' and I liked that they had Peet's coffee and teas. I agree that this place is a bit expensive at $24.95 per adult, but what a great experience over-all."
3074,2008-07-06,5,"This is one of the best aquariums I've ever been to and it's BIG.  We spent a full 5 hours exploring the aquarium and enjoyed every second.  If you're thinking about going...go now before they close the ""Jellies: Living Art"" exhibit...because IMO this is the best thing there.  It's in that outer bay wing which might be easy to miss if you don't look at the map.Plus, Monterey is just generally a nice place to be!One complaint: As with most places like this, there is a wee bit of hypocrisy.  First of all, there are signs on the paper towels that say ""paper = trees"" but no other hand drying option.  Secondly, it is very difficult to find water, especially by the restaurant.  I really think they do this to trick you into buying a drink...but there is a big water jug in the dining area.  Don't be fooled!  Nevertheless, I still have to give them 5 stars.Plus...one of my favorite things about the aquarium is their seafood guide.  Being in the environmental science field, and whining about overfishing as I do, I often get asked by people what they should eat.  I love these guides!mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafood…Also, you can buy tickets on the website.  This was so useful to us because it meant not standing outside in line forever.  Plus, there's no charge for it so you might as well."
3075,2009-07-22,1,"Has some nice displays and is certainly the best aquarium in the Monterey Bay area.  It is overrun with kids most of the time, but that is all part of the plan.  This place is run mostly as a propaganda piece for Julia Packard to teach children that the bay belongs to her and all fishermen are evil.Take a kid fishing!"
3076,2009-07-24,5,"I have been here many times before and have always been impressed with all the exhibits.This time, I came here for a pvt business event.  After the event, my kids and I were given a pvt tour.  The tour consisted of being taken to the employee only area where we were able to view all the fish up close from the opening of the tanks.SPECTACULAR....SPEECHLESS!!"
3077,2007-04-25,5,"What makes a visit to the aquarium necessary?To explore the sea, to lose your imagination with it, and to get away from all the stress that work or school may cause.I don't know about you, but I can spend hours just watching these beautiful and amazing animals of the Sea. From Jelly fishes, penguins, sharks, and of course, those adorable ""you wanna take one home"" Sea Otters. It's been a long time since I went here. I remember it being so big. Staring at those Jelly Fish, makes everything about the Sea, a world unknown. From the moment, you look at one, you wonder how on Earth do little guys survive and look as they do. I don't care too much about the penguins and other fishes (sharks, sun-fish ( most ugliest fish out there!!!!!), they just don't do it for me anymore. I love the sea, just learning another part of mother nature is the most rewarding and a must-see over again and again.... well....maybe in a year or with the family and friends."
3078,2009-03-14,5,"After many visits here, it never fails to please.  We are currently hosting a French exchange student, and with a limited budget, trying to show him things that are particularly Californian.Our great package deal on hotel and aquarium made this trip very economical, and I got to see the Aquarium through new eyes, not to mention learn a lot of French words I didn't know.  Trying to navigate through technical language was challenging and should help stave off the Alzheimer's, but the impact of the giant tank with the sharks, dolphin fish, schools of sardines and the bizarre and huge sunfish transcended translation difficulties, especially when the scuba-geared tank cleaners arrived, in their ""armor"", stainless steel mesh outer suits, and a zap pole to protect them from the sharks!Although the environmental danger messages are ubiquitous, they are made a little more palatable by being narrated by the delightful John Cleese.  MP nerds, unite!Our guest was appropriately mesmerized and impressed by that tank, and of course by the gorgeous psychedelic jellyfish.  It is easy to forget that the Monterey Trench is a source of constant new discoveries of bizarre creatures, right in our own backyard (or swimming pool)  teacher.scholastic.com/s….    (""dumbo octopus"" looks like he's wearing sneakers!)To take someone who doesn't take whales, otters, seals, rays, jellyfish, and octopus for granted is to get a new perspective on how well executed and in what a lovely area this place really is.Best of all, during shoulder season, the seashore at Monterey can be pristine and gorgeous.  Hurray fo da Bay!"
3079,2009-11-02,5,"This place was such a dream to visit, and I thoroughly enjoyed every part of this beautifully well-kept aquarium- from the whimsical touch tide pool of pink + orange starfish to the alien wonders (jellies) that floated aimlessly to and fro, without a single care in the world.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a truly magnificent place to spend the day. Highly recommend the daily sea otter feeding (3:30pm), as well as the kelp forest feeding (4pm). The adorable otters were uber-playful and out-going, and seemed to really enjoy the energy of the audience. The kelp forest feeding features an enormous floor-to-ceiling tank that is home to (obviously, kelp) spotted sharks, stripefish, and other odd-looking fishies. As a special treat for Halloween this past Saturday, the Great Pumpkin in a scuba suit fed all the kelp forest dwellers.. so cute :)The boy and I took in the magnificent views of the ocean, waved to kayakers passing by, and used the powerful magnascope stations to find sea lions sun-bathing on a distant rock. I spent a good half hour next to the manta ray tank, still my FAVORITE feature of the MBA, despite the fact that one of their gigantic deep-sea cousins murdered our beloved Croc Hunter, Steve Irwin :(  The giant octopus was scrunched up in a corner, which was a frightening sight to see for me, because I was shocked at how long it took me to locate it even in such a small confined TANK. Imagine all the creatures lurking in the Big Blue- primary reason why I do not swim in the ocean. Nope. Still, it was amazing to see such a wondrously shy monstrosity so up close.The new ""Secret Life of Seahorses"" exhibit includes over 15 species of seahorses. And let's not forget that these little wonders are also the world's most devoted fathers- the males give birth! Gotta love that. I could have watched the jellies huffy puff around their illuminated bubble-shaped tanks all day...can't wait to return for another visit soon!!*Remember, although ticket prices are a bit hefty ($30/person), the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a non-profit organization- so these fees contribute to the continuation of their work towards marine life preservation + education. It's definitely a win-win for everyone.*"
3080,2010-11-25,5,"This place is wonderful!!! My kids absolutely love going here, rain or shine. It is the perfect activity for those cold and miserable days when the park is off limits. The annual membership is not too expensive, and it practically pays for itself if you go there numerous times (like we have). The exhibits don't change all too often, but that's fine. The ones they do have neve fail to captivate."
3081,2010-06-30,5,"I love the Aquarium! It's so amazingly gorgeous and always interesting. They have new exhibits all the time, entertaining sea life, great touch pools for kids, and very helpful staff. It is always so much fun to go and worth the higher priced tickets. Check the website before you show up because they do close certain areas for maintenance and construction and the ticket prices vary by season."
3082,2007-07-23,5,"Am I the only person on the planet who thinks that a school of 6,000 sardines rushing full speed ahead in an endless overhead roundabout is not just mildly entertaining, but actually funny?  I thought so, until my best friend claimed to have experienced the same mindless phenomenon, a laughing fit accompanied by about 5 minutes of improvised sardine dialog.  She is arguably as inane as I am.  I guess that explains why we're friends. I've been to the aquarium about 4 or 5 times in the last 8 years, and my experience continues to get better each time.  The otters.  How can you not love a sea otter?  They're beautiful, and remarkably human in characteristic.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium has the best, even if it's the only sea otter exhibit that I've ever seen.  Their ""keeper"" (I don't know what else to call them) was tossing ice cubes into the tank, and the otters would float around on their backs collecting ice cubes in a little sack of flubber underneath their arms like a kid collects painted eggs on Easter, and then they'd munch on them one by one.  So I'm standing there watching, laughing my ass off the entire time, betwixt a sea of children and their parental counterparts looking like a total fool.  And I didn't care.  And no, I was neither stoned nor drunk, in case you're wondering.        The jelly fish exhibit is a psychedelic journey through evolution, and to give credit where credit is due, the aquarium has simply managed to capture mother nature in all her florescent majesty.  And there are forests of kelp and tunas larger than your 61"" flat screen TV, and sharks and crabs and anemone and sea fowl more elegant and graceful than you could ever hope to be.  If you have the slightest notion of how beautiful our world is, you'll leave the Monterey Bay Aquarium feeling amazed, and humbly grateful for your pathetic existence."
3083,2012-08-10,5,What can I say other than my family and IOVE this place!!! We take a road trip bi-yearly just to visit and enjoy their great exhibits. My daughters favorite thing has to be the 'deep ocean' feeding they usually do around 11am.
3084,2009-04-07,5,"This review is not enough to describe the sheer awesomeness of this place. You need to take that long drive down the coast and go see for yourself what the hype is all about. Then you will know why everyone talks so highly of this establishment. It is that good. Hopefully my review will help in some way, shape or form to add on to the other reviews to get you to come here for a day of fun.If you Are planning to come here you need to plan ahead. The drive it at least 2 hours long so be prepared for the drive. Potty breaks before you set off is essential if you have kids. Brings snacks and drinks in a cooler in case you need fluids. The drive down is a nice one because of the farms that are growing the various fruits and veggies. You can also see cows grazing in the pastures. And the beaches that run along the coast are spectacular! Very scenic indeed!Upon arriving at the aquarium you will need to find parking. If you are lucky you can get one at one of the lots they have for public parking. Reasonable rates for a day of parking. Once you get that out of the way, then you need to see if the people are hungry or not. There are places to eat along the way towards the aquarium on Cannery Row and there's also a place to eat inside the aquarium. The choice is yours to make.Once inside after paying your admission, you will be bombarded with visual information in the form of everything. You got models hanging from the ceiling of whales and dolphins. You got huge windows showing the waves crashing along the rocks at the base of the aquarium. You got a huge boiler from the old cannery that used to be there. You got a lot to soak in.We spent about 7 hours at this place. And I think we hit all the displays even with three kids running amok. Best ones I liked we the warm water tank with the sharks swimming with the blue and yellow fin tuna and other various fishes and also the coral reef tank near the entrance. The jellyfish display was beautiful in the way they were shown off. Very nicely put out and the lighting in that section helped make them look even better by showing off their unique color display and some showing off their ability to shine in the dark.If I could stay longer, I would have. But they close at night so that is kinda out of the question. If given a chance, I would have loved to jump into a safe tank and swim with the fishies but I don't think I will ever get that chance. Keep dreaming, I guess. I'll definitely be coming back again to soak in some more sites. One day is just not enough time!"
3085,2009-06-15,5,We finally made a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium after hearing great things about it from friends and family. I'm proud to be an AAA member because I saved $3 off the regular price for our tickets :) My husband & I decided to take a Monday off and take the kids. Great idea because it wasn't packed at all. We loved the exhibits. All of them were great but I have to say my personal favorite is the jelly fishes. They were so pretty to look at and hypnotic. My husband said his was a tie between the tuna and jelly fish. The seahorses were too cute! We went out on the deck to check out the view. They offer diving to kids 8-13 and it looked pretty cool. There's even a kiddie play area. We all enjoyed ourselves and plan to come back so that we can actually catch a feeding. The aquarium is close to lots of restaurants and they're all within walking distance. The staff were all very nice and informative. We will definitely be back in the future. I would recommend the aquarium to friends and family.
3086,2010-02-15,5,"Sea horse couples are so cute. They curl their tails together to hold hands.  I will not eat a sea horse, but looking at the other fishes made me hungry....such as the blue fin tuna and the big prawns....ah! so conflicted."
3087,2013-03-11,5,Great for kids or adults. This underwater zoo is amazing!
3088,2008-04-06,5,"This is one of the Gems of the Monterey Peninsula, an area with a lot of gems just 2 hours south of San Francisco. I grew up through a lot of my formative years in the area. My Mom used to sew car seat covers in a small factory halfway between the Aquarium and Pacific Grove's Lover""s Point many years ago, and she worked as a waitress right on Cannery Row before the aquarium existed. Cannery Row, with legendary local writer John Steinbeck making it famous, went from fish canneries to a tourist area over the past century. Now with the aquarium about 25 years old, it has brought a lot more visitors to the area and is a go to desitation for families and a tourist area trying to look like San Franicsco's Fisherman's Wharf in tourist traps, but with a moderated and mellow vibe.The aquarium is different than most, as it is constructed with Monterey Bay as part of it, and is as much a research institution for the deep depths of Monterey Bay and sourronding areas. It has had 2 Great White sharks here, the only ones in the world, which were released. It has great collection of other sharks, though, including Hammerhead, 7 Fin  and Leopard. One of its popular attractions, which I grew up seeing off Cannery Row in the Kelpbeds, are the Sea Otters. These cute, playful creatures are fun to watch, and the vertical tank is a great way to see them above and under water. The Kelp Bed exhibit, the Deep Ocean exhibit, the Jellyfish, the shoreline habitat, the interactive touch and feel counters, the Bat Ray interactive area, there is so many great things at this Aquarium. And they have taken a vertical approach to most of the large tanks, giving you a depth dimension you won't find at most major city aquariums.The goal of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which was created in part out of the passion of Hewlett Packard's founding family members to help make it, is to teach us about ocean and sealife preservation. As such, a unique exhibit is a video Seafood Cafe, which teaches which seafood are best to eat because of the techniques to catch them and keep them sustainable for the future. It is very educational, and take the little wallet guide with you, and you will change your seafood selections at any restaurant or store as a result. A tip: to avoid some of the crowds and lines getting in, order tickets on-line, and will call them. ($24.95 for adults, slightly less for students, seniors, and more off for kids ) Also, come before the summer tourists arrive en masse to the Monterey Peninsula, and come early if you can.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the many things to enjoy in the area, and it has helped the economy and sense of pride, since visitors come from around the world by the millions to this beautiful place. Being a semi-regular (I have been here many  times) the only thing for me is that the displays, by their nature, do not change much. So when the Great White was caught and put in, it was very exciting. The sun fish and sea turtles are great, the jelly fish fantastically soothing, love the sea otters and everything is wonderful, but I go less frequently now."
3089,2009-05-25,1,"1 word: Dissapointing!30 Minute line to buy a ticket, the nastiest people I've ever seen, too many (rude) kids, and not a lot of sea life. The place was extremely packed and they let too many people into this place.  There were more murals than animals. Hoards of people crowd around the small glass windows so you can't see anything. This was definitely not built for large amounts of people to enjoy and see.I don't recommend coming here at all...ever! If you really need to go to an aquarium, just visit the Academy of Sciences during the middle of the week at 9am sharp.  Aside from wasting my entire Sunday for this place, I got years worth of birth control from all the annoyance."
3090,2009-08-11,4,"I love this place, but when we went the place was packed like sardines!! Every exhibit was elbow to elbow, shoulder to shoulder.  It was really hard to enjoy myself. There was even a roller coaster line to buy tickets. I've been to the aquarium many times, and I've never seen it like this.I definitely won't be coming during the summer. I'll come again during the winter, when summer tourists and summer vacation families are elsewhere.  Can't wait to see the seahorses, wild otters, marine animals, w/o having to fight my way to the glass. I'll see you in the Off Peak Season!BTW, I didn't see the sun fish in the outer bay exhibit, which made me very very sad. :("
3091,2011-06-08,4,"I am a native northern Californian and have been coming to this aquarium and Monterey since the late 80's. It is world class without a doubt, if your in Monterey you have to go. With that said, don't go on a weekend during the summer. The place is a zoo. Always go to Monterey during the week M-f if you can! Or else the weekends during the winter. We went on a sunday-wed, arrived at 230pm and it was fine because they close at 5pm and people were starting to go. But I have been during the week and it's way less crowded. With no children, we could cruz through, enjoy everything in about 3 hours. They feed most of the animals in the am around 11 I think and for sure at 4pm, so you'll want to see that. Especially, the sea otter feeding, but get there early and get a front spot at the glass. I have noticed that over the years the aquarium has been going a bit over the top with all the kiddie junk, jungle gyms, bouncy floor, children playland type thing, but at least it's on the top floor away from the good academic exhibits. It also works as a trap, sucking that demographic of the crowd away from the nice exhibits, so It doesn't bother me too much, I will probably have kids someday and will understand better. But babies, come on people, they are not even going to remember anything.  Do us all a favor and bring the kids when they can walk around on there own without those annoying-taken-up-space-strollers!!!! The giant shark tank was CLOSED and is closed until july or August. I was very disappointed because this was my favorite exhibit that I wanted to show my new bride. But I still had a great time and love this aquarium and feel blessed something so amazing is only 1.25 hours from my house. To add I hunted for discounts or coupons but couldn't find any. College student's can get a few bucks off, but that's it.  Parking is ok, seen worse seen better, it's california! All meters in town are 2 hours max. Pic a hotel downtown or use bicycles like we did and leave the car at the hotel, makes monterey way more fun!!!There are some great bicycle paths there.Just visited May of 2014. The prices are up again along with all prices in the new century. In 2011 it was $28 approximately. Now it's around $35-40 pp."
3092,2013-07-12,4,"Love Kelp Forest, the jellyfish, sea horses, otters, and penguins. Great place to pass the time with little ones. All the employees I've come in contact with have been super friendly and helpful. Prices are a bit steep. I believe we paid $105 for 2 adults and a student. Thank goodness the baby was free."
3093,2015-12-10,5,"This is the best aquarium! I live locally and go a couple of times a year, it never gets old."
3094,2013-08-18,5,Variety of awe inspiring exhibits. My favorites are the large tanks (deep sea) that have seating where you can kick back and enjoy the beauty as long as you like.
3095,2013-12-07,5,"Thank you for a wonderful holiday event last night!! I love being a member, and being able to bring my grandchildren to the aquarium whenever they are in town.  The variety of hands on exhibits, huge tanks, many volunteers sharing knowledge makes for a fun and learning experience for all ages.We love you!!"
3096,2011-03-28,4,"Members night was packed! Was able to check out some of the ""behind the scenes"" which were neat.Hopefully, they will re-plan the snacks & beverages station better - it was a mad house waiting for a bite & drink.But a good solid investment, in becoming a member of the Monterey Bay Aquarium."
3097,2007-08-22,5,"Otters make me happy.  That is an indelible and enduring truth about me, and one of the main reasons why otters are in my top five favorite animals.I wasn't going to review the Aquarium to rival all Aquariums, but then I started thinking about otters and happiness and decided, ""What the hell?  So what if I'll be the 196th review?  Just go for it!""Since otters make me happy, this aquarium also makes my happy.  Mostly because of the multitude of sea otters who frolic so happily in their enclosure.  However, its also a great place to see otters in the wild.  They like to come in from the ocean, wrap themselves in some kelp so they don't float around too much and take naps in the kelp beds.The Aquarium also has the Outer Bay Exhibit, also known as the big tank with the most relieved, ginormous fish ever in it.  Can you imagine having to share your tank, which has no possibility of escape, with a white shark (not quite great because its not big enough), having several members of you get eaten, being relieved once because the fish-eating killer is gone, and then having another fish-eating killer (albeit a smaller one) placed in your midst?  The happiest day of those fishes lives was probably the day the second one was deemed too big to remain.  I feel for those fish the day the Aquarium folks manage to get a third shark.  I think the nervous breakdowns, drug habits and self-destructive behaviors of the fish will put the Britney's, Lohan's and Paris's of the world to shame.**********************************************An update - 10/31/07I have just heard that the aquarium has acquired another young male white shark.  I'm not going to guarantee, but I'm thinking the entire Outer Bay exhibit may be due for a Brittney Spears type meltdown.  Soon, we will be seeing fantastically trashed fish who have forgotten to put on their underpants."
3098,2013-03-25,5,Of course I made the mistake of going here on the weekend during Spring Break so it was painfully crowded but nevertheless it's always a good time here (next time I'll go on a weekday).  My favorite are the penguins and the touch pool to stroke the sea cucumber.  If you go on weekends plan on being there for a good part of the day since it will take forever to just get up close to the glass much less take a picture.  Otherwise the weekday is the best bet for this lovely aquarium.
3099,2008-09-03,5,"I haven't been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium since I was a kid, and I think they've only gotten better over time.  There were a bunch of exhibits that I think are fairly new, almost all were awe-inspiring.  The idea came up when inspecting our google-mapped plan to drive down to Hearst Castle.  With such a long drive, many times it's a good idea to break up the drive with excursions in between.I noticed Monterey was smack dab in the middle of our route, so I decided to pay them a long overdue visit.  I visited on a Saturday of labor day weekend so the Aquarium was mobbed with families, kids, and tourists.  Even with all this, it was a wonderful experience.  I've read that the Jellyfish exhibit is closing Sept 14th.  This will be a shame, because it is one of the more beautiful and interesting exhibits they have.  If you have kids, a visit here is a must."
3100,2014-05-19,2,"Maybe I'm spoiled because my local zoo and aquarium is top notch but I was not impressed by this place at all, for the price. The jellyfish and Octopus displays were nicely done but the only other real attraction was to watch Otter's being fed and there were so many people in the way that we barely saw an otter. When we left we ended up seeing jellyfish and sea lions out in the wild so it kind of felt even more like a rip off to pay $80 for two people to see this place. If the prices were just a bit more reasonable I suppose I would have been more impressed."
3101,2008-08-22,5,"It is one of the best places you can go in Monterey and if you have kids, it is one of the best places to go in the Bay Area. Sure it is loaded with tourists and too crowded but once you get inside you will see why. It's spectacular.The whale skeleton, the jellyfish exhibit, the kelp tank, the sea otters. If your kids don't come away from all this and more with a real love for the ocean and the environment, what else can you do?Pay the extra $10.00 and take the behind the scenes tour. You will be able to get away from all the crowds and see how everything is being run. It is quite the operation. Or become an aquarium member, you will be able to get discounts and special entrance lines. It may be worth it to you if you come here a lot.There is also touch tanks where your kids can touch sea anemones and shark tanks where they can see real sharks swimming around in circles. Try not to miss anything while you are there and bring your camera to capture all of the special adventures. There is also a big gift shop for you to pick up books and other knick-knacks and take them home with you."
3102,2010-10-02,5,"If you plan on coming here, make sure to buy your tickets early as the line can get SUPER long! Some exhibits are closed for renovation until 2011 right now, but you can still some pretty cool jelly fish, kelp forest, sharks, and sea creatures. Very kid-friendly and couple-friendly. I knew if I were ever reincarnated, I'd want to live in the ocean. Monterey Bay Aquarium simply reinforced my dream :)"
3103,2008-06-05,4,"This is a pretty cool place.  I came when I was a kid when it first opened.  I'm kind of on the fence about exactly what makes aquaria better than zoos, and I don't generally like zoos, so I'll withhold my fifth star for now.(Feel free to PM me to argue your case that aquaria are better than zoos.)"
3104,2008-09-16,4,"We went on Labor Day.  Thank god everyone else was heading back to their laboring because it was relatively empty.  However, to be quite honest, with all the hype, I was a little underwhelmed.  The Great White Shark they have been talking up is located in murky water with a bunch of other fish, and the only glimpse of it I got was brief.  The hammerhead was much more people friendly.  I was however impressed with the collection of jellyfish.  The displays were lit up immaculately, and the colors were astounding.  The coolest jellyfish though wasn't photographed because unless I had a video camera you couldn't capture the magic.  It looked like a translucent burning man float with neon electricity shooting thru it.  If only I remembered the name.The sealions were playful and adorable as well.Its a nice weekend stop.  I would recommend it, though don't expect to see awesome sharks."
3105,2011-09-28,5,Fantastic attraction.  Clean and modern.  Jelly fish and starfish exhibits are really great.  Wonderful location.I can't wait to bring my kids with me next time.
3106,2007-04-22,4,"It's been about ten years since I've been back to the MBA.. So from memory, I was not too excited to go back. Wasn't too much of an aquarium enthusiast, I guess.  The only exhibit I really looked forward to was the new Wild About Otters. But of course.. it was with Yelpers.. and since I'm a newb on the threads, it was nice to meet some more folks too.If you want to really enjoy the exhibits, I would highly recommend going during the weekdays.. or wearing stilts [risk of falling = highly likely, as there are swarms of people]. We arrived around noon and there was a long line wrapped to one side of the building [opens at 10]. Thankfully, Stanley K. had group reservations, so we avoided the general adm line and were allowed in shortly after everyone showed up. The aquarium customer guide/liaison [or whatever their title is] was incredibly accommodating. First stop: Wild About Otters! The river otters were smaller than I expected, but very cute and playful. i could barely get a good glimpse of them frolicking in their habitat with little kids/ parentals all plastered to the glass.The jellyfish exhibits were amazing..  very pretty and mysterious. One room of jellyfish seemed like a neverending tunnel.  Nope, just mirrors.. *thunk* ow. rubs forehead.. We also saw a detached tentacle, and what looked like a dead jellyfish falling toward the bottom of the tank.. NOpe, not dead, apparently.. just lazy. it moved finally. ""I shall call him 'Squishy,' and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy!""they sure have some characters in there.. the huge hideous sunfish was a camera whore, while the hammerhead shark was a tease. The octopus was pissed off because someone decided to flash the poor thing. People.. keep your shirts on!! Seriously though.. if you're going to take pictures, make sure your flash is off.. Touch pools were cool.. the bat rays were sticking toward the center of their pool... i'm sure it gets annoying being felt up all day.. though some people may disagree.. :P the starfish, sea cucumbers, and other smaller creatures were not as lucky.. *poke poke.. The Sea Otter feeding was also super crowded.. I expected nothing less. I even had to distract some people in front of me to help squeeze some kids closer to the windows.. They were sooo cute! [not the kids.. the sea otters!] I didn't pick up a sea otter plushie though it was tempting.. The two giftshops were chock full of plush sea creatures..  all sorts... even ugly ones...Tinna H [holds up an ugly squid/octopus, w/ look of disgust]: who the hell would get this for their kid.?!?!I was only disappointed because I missed, or they didn't have, Sea Turtles.. and oh.. did i mention it was crowded...?"
3107,2007-08-10,4,"After weeks of being tormented by the poster of the otter with his tongue sticking out at BART, I relented and decided to find out if I am truly Wild About Otters. Short answer: Yes. Yes, I am.Otters are some sort of aquatic hybrid of a kitten and a puppy, and their only purpose appears to be to frolic, sleep floating on their backs with their paws over their eyes (OH MY GOD), and delightfully use tools to  crack open delicious snacks. I think they are evolutionarily just a few generations away from fashioning adorable outfits for themselves, like overalls and tiny otter tee shirts. I'm sure I picked up a few actual facts about otters from the helpful docents, but honestly I was too blinded by their cuteness to retain them.The whole rest of the aquarium is HOURS (2.5 hours to be exact) of entertainment, and even on a Sunday, is not too crowded to enjoy. Don't be intimidated by the monsterous line at the entrance, cause it moves really fast. And don't pay $2000000 for parking at the public lots -- if you drive like half a mile past the residential permit parking, there are oodles of spaces for free."
3108,2008-04-27,5,"Gorgeous views of the Bay, and very educational! We came here on a weekend so it was NUTS... a bit chaotic-- and I think we may have missed a few things... but we enjoyed our visit. I haven't been here since I was a kid, and BF had never been here... so we wanted to come check it out. The jellyfish exhibits were breathtaking and ethereal... absolutely mesmerizing. The tiny jellyfish tanks were amazing as well. I didn't see the Sun Fish anywhere. Where was it? Anyway, take everyone's advice and buy tickets online to avoid standing in the line. Also, we had to park faaaaaaar away... about a 10 minute walk to the Aquarium, but it was scenic and a nice stroll with the BF... so no points docked for that. =]"
3109,2011-05-25,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is a MUST when going to Monterey. I've been to the aquarium several times. They are often changing exhibits which keeps it interesting. Sorry to fellow critics, but it is not comparable to Disneyland... :) I have been to a few aquariums/zoos/etc. and this is definitely the best there is. The staff is generally very helpful and knowledgeable. My favorite exhibits are The Secret Life of Seahorses and the Penguins. I could watch the penguins all day. It is a bit pricey, but there is no other place like it. Take a whole morning/afternoon to slowly make your way through the aquarium. It is a very enjoyable time."
3110,2013-06-28,5,"This was one of the best aquariums I've ever been to. Lots to see and really fun. I was a little surprised at the size, it was a little smaller than expected, but don't get me wrong... it was still a big aquarium. Check out the jelly fish exhibit, it was my favorite!"
3111,2011-08-07,4,"-1 star because of the large crowd but that's it! I suggest buying the tickets ahead of time and getting there early. We got there on a Saturday morning and bypassed the line to pick up our tickets at will call. I haven't been here since I was a kid and the only thing I remember is the big whale hanging down from the ceiling near the entrance. So when I walked in and saw that...oh man, I felt like a kid again. My fiance and I decided to come here because 1. It was our 2 year anniversary and 2. We weren't too impressed with the California Academy of Sciences. This place is amazing. All the animals and volunteers truly impressed me. My favorites were the jellyfishes and the seahorses. Of course watching the anchovies swimming around with their mouths open were completely entertaining to watch. I also loved the touch pools. Being able to get one on one with the animals was pretty cool. I got to hold a crab for the first time. Good thing it had no claws!! I recommend this place. Great for kids, wonderful souvenirs and the people working here look like they truly love what they do."
3112,2008-03-07,4,"I've been to the aquarium more times than I can distinctly remember, and I still enjoy it. Recently, I had the pleasure of taking a daytrip down to Monterey to ogle at the various wildlife presented by the Monterey Bay Aquarium with a wonderful woman. We made it there in decent time from SF, despite the weather and a nearly failed attempt at a gas station refill. Mental note: when filling a tank, squeeze the pump handle to begin flow of gas.On to the aquarium itself!The jellyfish are amazing in their alien form and body. The aquarium has done a wonderful job of putting these critters on display. The otters are pretty difficult to watch during feeding time on the weekend, owing to the crowds. The massive swarm of sardines isn't quite as breathtaking the nth time around, but the coral fish are. And I have always dug the beach tide exhibit.We got an unexpected giggle out of watching a spiny king crab terrorize the shrimp in its tank, causing hasty retreats from the crab's spindly and poky legs. It made me want to keep an aquarium of my own with a spiny king crab, so I watch various other smaller critters run away whenever I wanted.I can't fault the aquarium, but the Penguin attraction was closed for renovations. I believe that this is re-opening very shortly, but it highlights a particular point-- if there's something that you're especially keen on seeing, it would be a good idea to check the aquarium's website to make sure it's open. There aren't too many different attractions / areas, and while most host a variety of creatures in individual tanks, some are single, large tanks with a large host of creatures. Had I done this, I would have also known that the great white shark had already been released.Unfortunately, one of my absolute favorite bits, the ""Sandy Shore"", is in need of some attention. I adore bat rays, but all were cowering in a corner of their pool, I suspect owing to the number of little hands splashing the water. Since they live in a touching pool, I don't know exactly how one could remedy that situation-- it would drive any curator bat-ray-shit crazy to ask a thousand children a day to not splash the waters. But the bat rays looked like they had no intention of coming anywhere within reach of a human hand, and I can't blame them.At any rate, the aquarium does seem to get smaller with each visit. One possible reason for this feeling during the last visit is that it was a rainy day, so we couldn't readily bop outside to watch the ocean waves and stroll around. The location is one of the highlights of the aquarium, and should be enjoyed.What made my day exemplary, of course, was the company I kept. She makes going to the grocery store fun, but going to the aquarium and seeing it through her eyes for the first time is a blast. The aquarium makes for a romantic and simple date, and is certainly better with friends or family than alone, so thank you to her for taking me."
3113,2010-02-23,5,"So besides a romantic getaway, the sneaky, underhanded purpose the BF had for choosing Carmel is the fact that it's next to Monterey. And that Monterey has the super cool Monterey Bay Aquarium. With their latest exhibit, The Secret Lives of Seahorses. That I've been wanting to go see ever since it came out. When he told me that we were going, I was RIDICULOUSLY excited. I love the Aquarium and have many fond memories of it. We arrived around 10am to a burgeoning throng of families and couples walking through and gazing at sea otters, fish, centipedes, starfish, and seahorses, oh my! The otters are adorable when they eat, constantly washing everything. We managed to catch a feeding at the Kelp Forest and was thoroughly entertained with questions from the kids to the diver (who was the head of all volunteer divers there!). Also, if your point & shoot camera has an aquarium setting, USE IT. BF's camera did and the pictures turned out amazing!We wandered practically everywhere. I'm more of the ""read everything that's posted up about what you're gawking at"" type of girl while the BF tends to be ""glance, marvel for 1/2 second, on to the next one"" sort of man. So we definitely lost each other a few times amidst other gawking little ones & their parental units. One of my favorite exhibits is the jellyfish one! LOVE THEM. I love how serene and squishy and graceful they are. I'm fascinated with how they look against the blue background when they're highlighted as a pale pink and other such colors. Then, we ended our rounds at the Secret Lives of Seahorses. Iron-wrought gates made it even more fancy along with the signage. But they are some of my favorite oceanic creatures. And the males are the baby carriers!!!  This is a great exhibit that I could spend a great deal of time in (and did!)This is such a wonderful place. I can't wait to check out the new Flamingo exhibit when it opens up!"
3114,2010-10-18,3,"The outside looks like a run down factory, but it's like they say: don't judge a book by its cover.I was completely entranced by some of the exhibits, my favorite one would have to be the gigantic Monterey Bay Habitats with the sharks & yellow fin tuna, or the circular dome-shaped room with sardines in it."
3115,2010-06-29,5,"This place is soooo nice. The exhibits are amazing -- the workers are helpful, informative, and friendly AND the price is right. General admission is $29.95. Students $27.95. Military $25.95.Get 12+ in a group, reserve two days in advance, and get an extra $2 off per person PLUS one free admission per 12 people!Expect to pay about $1.50 to $2 per hour for parking at nearby street/meters or parking lots. Many meters have 12 hour maximums."
3116,2007-12-20,5,"Stop #1 on the moving roadtrip.This is a perfect place to walk around and revert to a more child-like day when you could stare endlessly at the happy-go-lucky otters, and the eerie and alien-like octopuses.It is a wee bit pricey, and it is disappointing that the penguins exhibit is closed for the renovation, but the other parts are so worth it that it doesn't phase me too much.  The Ocean Sunfish are supremely huge and quite ugly, but really fascinating to see.  And we were lucky enough to be there when they had the young white shark, which although it was small, was still supremely ominous.All in all, it is a fantastic day out.  I wish there were some less kitchy restaurants around that part of town, but I guess that is what you can expect around a world-famous aquarium."
3117,2010-01-21,5,"I often spend hours staring at my brother's fish tank. Seriously, I don't even have to be sitting in a chair...I will just stand there and stare at the beautiful corals and watch his two nemos swimming back and forth.So naturally one of my favorite places to go to is the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We took my cousin and her family the Monday after Christmas and they were just amazed by all the different marine life and the massive size of MBA.  MBA was one of many highlights of their trip.So what did we all do once we got here...Stared at fish. For hours. While standing."
3118,2010-08-17,4,"It's a really nice and modern aquarium! Probably makes to the top 5 aquariums that I have been (my #1 is still Georgia Aquarium.)My boyfriend and I spent a whole afternoon there and it's a plenty of time. We were able to see some live feeding following their schedule sheet. I really enjoyed their jelly fish, penguins, and sea otters. They also give out seafood watch guides (including sushi) that you can put in your pocket. Those are quite useful. It's definitely a must-do when you are at Monterey. It makes you appreciate the ocean lives much more. It has tons of hands-on things which could be very educational for kids."
3119,2007-09-24,5,"This has got to be the world's premiere aquarium.  Or at least California's.Or at least the best one I've ever been to!  :)I think this is just an amazing place to see fish.  My favorite are the jellyfish.  It's cool (ok, maybe not in a natural creature in captivity sort of way but in a get to examine it up close kind of way) when they have a great white shark too.  In recent years they've put in new interactive exhibits for the kids that are great.  It pretty much costs an arm and a leg to get in...so make damn sure you can at least spend a few hours.  And that means if your child doesn't have an attention span of a couple of hours...you're better off waiting until he's older."
3120,2008-07-04,3,"Are you in a relationship where you don't want to have kids but your partner does?  TAKE THEM HERE.  This place is seriously the best birth control on the market, nuff said.Nice lookin' fishes too."
3121,2009-02-23,5,"Still 5 huge stars for this place because the whole entire place is different, and still amazing every single time that we go.  More often than not, there have always been a massive amount of humanity (more kids than anything) when we have gone.  But, we found a better way to experience the aquarium sens too many school kids on field trips.  We went on a Friday afternoon after 2pm.  When we first walked-in, there was easily 100 kids in the main lobby, but they were all being ushered out by their chaperons to go home.  From there on out, there were still people, but. by no means the same as at, say, 10 or 11am. So, for a little bit quieter experience take a half day on a Friday, and head down to the aquarium!"
3122,2009-09-16,5,"The special exhibits are always worth an extra trip.The Jellyfish and currently the Seahorses are beautifully designed and a pleasure to see. The special exhibits will suprise you, educate you and entertain you. You can appreciate them as art or science. It's a shame that they are temporary. They should pass them on to other aquariums. The current Great White Shark is a sweet little miss. She passed by the glass  and gave us a toothy grin with a bit of gore hanging from her teeth."
3123,2009-01-02,5,"I love aquariums. Somehow there is something theraputic about watching a bunch of fish swim in the tanks. May be it has the same effect on the people who work here. What I was the most impressed about this place, was not the breathtaking view, or the displays or those huge tanks. It was the staff. Every single person here were so friendly with smiles all over their faces. This was truly an incredible place to stop by. It was so awesome that my hubby promised to each other that when we have kids, we will bring them here. It is amazing how they were able to fit all those huge tanks and also to have incredible ocean view all in this small place, I really don't know. It was a very well organized aquarium. So many fun things for children, from splash zone to petting spots, adorable sea otters that pound on the glass, and penguins. Be sure to get an early start. We went around 10AM and it was perfect. By the time we were trying to get out, we saw this crazy long lines. We were glad to scrape the plan to go to breakfast first and grab some stuff from here instead. They have a full service restaurant as well as a self service restaurant.The only downside of this place was.... too many stores. I understand that all of their money is probably put into a good use, but three gift stores (or was it four?) was a bit too much.OMG the views. Gorgeous views. Do not forget to bring your video camera or regular camera or even cellphone cameras. Something to mark your precious memories."
3124,2011-02-06,3,"5 stars on an off peak day and 0 for a crowded day.  You pay admission, you expect to see fish at an aquarium..... You won't get to do that if it's a holiday weekend, just loads of people.But on an uncrowded day like today, a random Febuary Sunday, every exibit was viewable,even by our shortest member of the family."
3125,2007-09-25,5,"I've been to many aquariums growing up and without doubt, Monterey is one of the best I've been to. Here are some important things to keep in mind when planning a visit:-When to go: Of course, it's totally up to you, but from experience, I've found that going in the morning and being there when they open gives you a really good visit. Most guests spend 3 hours, some even the entire day, but going in the morning gives you advantages. For example, the first otter feeding is at 10:30, followed by an Outer Bay feeding at 11, and some others at 11:30. While there are certainly later feeding times during the day, the first one in the morning is less crowded and you can actually see the cute-as-a-button otters versus being in the back of a crowd and barely able to see anything at all. Another reason to go early is to try many breakfast places that Monterey has to offer. First Awakenings is within walking distance to the aquarium and serves such hearty pancakes and delicious scrambles that make it a favorite among the locals. -Parking: Across the street from the aquarium, there's a convenient parking lot that charges a max of $12 for your car.-Discounts: Appropriate discounts are given for seniors, disabled, children and students up to 17 years old, or those 18+ with a valid student id. If I'm not mistaken the most of the discounts are $2 off the regular adult price of $24.95.-Exhibits: Again, it's totally personal choice on what exhibits to focus on. I've always liked the Wild About Otters and Outer Bay exhibits. Definitely go to the outer bay during feeding times. The bluefin tunas that they have here are humongous - easily 700 lbs each! And as soon as the staff throw in the food - squid and little fishies - the tunas, as huge as they are, race to get their food! I never knew tunas could swim that fast. It's also pretty cool how the dolphin fish changes color as it gets excited about the food. -Great White (limited time only): If you want to see a great white other than from your tv, the best time to go visit is NOW. In a couple months time they will be releasing their most famous catch back to the wild. I think this is only the third time that a great white has been put on display and they always release it after a few months time because it doesn't do well in their tanks. The great white that they have is only about 5-feet long (it is a baby after all), but I think it's still pretty cool to see one. The volunteer was saying how much special treatment it gets versus the other fish on exhibit (it eats first-grade salmon among other things). -After the aquarium: drive the 17-mile drive ($9 per car to get in, but residents and their guests are free of charge), stop by Carmel and explore the quaint Spanish Mission style architecture of the buildings and churches, explore Pebble Beach, get your picture taken with crashing waves behind you, etc..-Culinary delights: Carmel and Monterey have many world-class dining establishments that you can choose from. If you're making the drive back to the Bay Area, a local place called Phil's Fish Market & Eatery in Moss Landing serves the BEST cioppino. It was featured on Food Network's Road Tasted by the Deen brothers and after having a bowl of their cioppino, it's been ruined for me. I can't have it anywhere else but here. Really, it's that good. If you're not a tomato soup fan, no worries, they have tons of other great food - from seafood salads, to fried seafood, to hearty clam chowders (both red and white). Yum-o!"
3126,2013-06-19,5,"Been to many aquariums as I love sea life, but none have surpassed the Monterrey Bay Aquarium."
3127,2013-07-28,3,"I wasnt really impressed here. Maybe because I have been a lot of aquariums in other countries. Its cool to take kids though. My favorite was the sea horse area. I have never seen that much kinds of sea horses. Only one bad thing was they took 30 minutes to make three hot chocolates. They need to hire more workers,especially on Sunday!"
3128,2008-05-17,5,"Wow, just wow!  I've been back home for a week and this was one of the many highlights of our trip.  This aquarium has truly stood the test of time and is a coastal gem!  I haven't been here in years and after going to the Long Beach aquarium, I feared that the Monterey Bay aquarium may have lost it's magic, luckily I was wrong.  This place is stunning.  I love how they incorporate the coast into the the aquarium itself, thus creating a seamless view of marine life that you are just not going to see anywhere else.The jellyfish tanks were incredible, and the sea otter exhibit was adorable.  There's plenty of interactive exhibits for kids, but I swear it's just as fun even if you don't have kids in tow.  I saw folks from 8 to 80 having a great time.They have this cool Plexiglas covered canopy that overlooks the outside and they have a simulated wave crashing over it.  Now I must tell you, this was the physical manifestation of a recurring nightmare of mine, but it was completely cool to experience.  Don't forget to check out the Giant Octopus exhibit too!  We went mid-week, so while the crowds weren't horrible, it is a popular place, so come prepared to block kids and avoid the camera flash."
3129,2014-07-24,3,"Here's the deal - for the price you pay to buy tickets for a family of four - about 125 bucks, it's okkkaaayyy at best. We lived in Baltimore for many years and the National Aquarium is undoubtedly better.  You cannot beat the variety of the Baltimore aquarium.  Anyway, happy to support the upkeep of marine wildlife (a good cause the Monterey aquarium pursues) and ticking the check box of having visited the aquarium. Would I revisit? An emphatic no."
3130,2013-02-12,4,"This aquarium is great, I have been here several times, and they have changed some of their exhibitions.  The missing star is because I think the price is high and considering the volume of people that visit here everyday"
3131,2013-07-27,4,"Lots to see, whole day event.  Weekends are a but crouded though, I got run over but so many strollers!"
3132,2006-06-03,5,"I love this place.  It's a great place for the kids, but parents will truly enjoy themselves too!  My hubby loved seeing the sharks.  I enjoyed watching the video about the cruelty to sharks.  You can walk out to the deck and the view is so beautiful.  It really is a great deal for all you get!"
3133,2011-09-14,4,"Everybody LOVES the Aquarium; its full of wonders.I just wish - the staff would have told me on the Monday evening - I could come in and purchase a ticket, enjoy the last night of some lectures being held there, then come back the next day and enjoy the aquarium.That's right - a two day ticket is the SAME price as a one day. Why don't they tell you this? Its a money scam - terrible.Also - there is a very small tank housing two turtles. Its disgusting and inhumane that these creatures have to live in here; its too small.I couldn't look at them for long as the cramp conditions were causing them to display repetitive behaviour. Their mental health was in decline. I felt complicit in this dodgy animal abuse for buying a ticket. Please complain - maybe the management will listen if enough people write in. Love the exhibits - the lay out, the friendly informative staff, the grounds, its great. Pity about the above."
3134,2015-11-14,5,"My wife and I visited for the first time and were blown away by the experience.  Not only are the exhibits fantastic, but the staff is remarkably friendly and quick to answer questions and make the guest feel welcome.  We were particularly impressed by the ready information and emphasis on conservation.  We are already planning a return trip next year!"
3135,2008-11-30,4,"I had been looking forward to going to this aquarium for awhile now, ever since I moved to the Bay Area last year. To get one more day of fun out of our Thanksgiving holiday weekend, I went here with my S.O. and brother-in-law today. It wasn't too crowded, so that was definitely a plus.My favorite exhibits were as follows:- sea otters -- how can you not smile when you look at one??- jellyfish. The jellyfish are so graceful -- they move with such elegance through their tanks that I sat and watched them for a long time. Also, the music in the jellyfish area was completely relaxing -- so much so that I almost needed more caffeine before my 1.5-hr (2 hrs. in traffic) ride home.- the ""Splash Zone"" exhibit where we could pick up starfish and touch a sea cucumber -- I was even able to convince my brother-in-law to touch them, and that's something he doesn't usually do. Good thing there was a bottle of Purell on the wall nearby. (Hi, S.!)- penguins -- two of them were mating while we were there. Priceless.There are several reasons why I didn't give my review 5 stars:- Parking was a little confusing, since I missed the entrance the first time around. To return to where we started, we had to go down the street for awhile, since we couldn't turn left anywhere. So close, yet so far!- $25 per person? Seriously? At least I found a $2 off coupon that all three of us used for a total of $6 off. I also got my brother-in-law the student BIG WHOPPING extra $2 discount. Total off: $8. I know this aquarium has a good reputation and that the money goes toward the facility's upkeep, but that seems a bit steep for an afternoon there. And why do they think students can afford $22.95 as opposed to $24.95? That's not enough of a difference.... Many many thanks to S. for paying.- I've been to the Boston Aquarium and the Vancouver Aquarium, and didn't really see anything that I haven't seen before.So, the Monterey Bay Aquarium gets 4 stars because I had fun and really enjoyed the exhibits I mentioned above."
3136,2009-09-15,4,"I'd give it 3 stars, but we came during otter week, and the sea otters were flipping adorable.I think the last time i came here was for a elementary school field trip....10+ years ago.  But coming back...nothing has changed.  Same exhibits, with crazy fish, seahorses, and what not..but i swear there was a tunnel that you got to walk through...where the flip is the tunnel? or were we thinking of something else?Good spot for a hot date and some cupcaking, but get ready to shell out ~$30 per person."
3137,2011-04-08,4,"Wasn't sure what to expect but would recommend whether you're on your own, with friends or with family.Spent a few hours looking at the many varieties of sealife, from Sea Otters (a big favourite), to sharks, to seahorses (many varieties).The talks are worth going to and I was impressed with the guy who was a retired marine biologist who I could have listened to for hours."
3138,2009-02-27,5,"Fish behind glass. Nothing. Nothing is better.Yes, some say that a trip to an ice cream store, or jelly beans brings out the kid in you, but for me, I morph into a big eyed, barely able to walk kid, still thinking that I can touch the fish if I press against the glass hard enough.This is probably one of my favorite places to visit, and there's something about getting a glimpse of what's under the big blue blanket of our world that just gets me excited.First, the kelp exhibit is simply awe inspiring. I can't tell you enough how intoxicating it is to just watch kelp sway from side to side with the tides of the sea. ( Yes, I am lame, but this places rocks, and if you don't think so, go climb under one...)My favorite exhibit though has got to be the huge 1 million gallon Outer Bay. It is breathtaking.Seeing the massive silver bullets of gigantic tuna speed across a mind blowing glass wall is memorizing.This room would be the ultimate slumber party pad. Tucked in a sleeping bag and just watching the fish glide across me all night would be remarkable.I love this place, and you won't ever catch me saying no to a visit."
3139,2008-07-31,1,"BORING!!!I guess the Monterey Bay Aquarium is more for the younger crowd or maybe even people that enjoy the outdoors, or the sea! I seriously had a bad time here. I was bored out of my mind... going crazy watchin the fishes doing the same thing over and over. The most exciting portion of the aquarium was the Sea Otters... THEY ARE SO CUTE... but watch out.... they are a bit aggressive so they say on the information board. I was here during my 8th grade bio trip.... it was boring then... and it was just as boring now. I don't even want to come back here. Thank you."
3140,2008-03-10,5,"Alas, I was able to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium!  I've been to Monterey a few times before but for some reason never made it to the aquarium.  But I think I was just waiting for the right person to accompany me - my Sweet C.The jelly fish exhibit was the highlight of my trip there!  I could've watched and taken pictures of them all day long!  They are beautiful to gaze at with their illuminating colors against the sea blue backdrop.  I also enjoyed watching the sea otters play and was in awe of the beauty of the kelp forest and its golden hue accentuated by the light that beamed down into this 28 foot high wonderland."
3141,2015-11-12,5,"May be one of my favorite aquariums thus far, and I've been to quite a few. Big shark, tuna, turtle tank was awesome. Otter exhibit was fun to watch! Great for families, kids, and day dates!"
3142,2009-03-18,5,"Furry, funny and fabulous...it's all about the otters.  I could stare at those little guys all day.  Wild About Otters kicked this from a four star to a five with the twitch of an adorable nose.The jellyfish are entrancing.  The leopard sharks are fierce (in a Project Runway kind of way, actually they were pretty mellow in the tank.)  The penguins are amusing.  The sunfish shows that evolution has taken some comical turns.  The interactive Splash Zone exhibit keeps kids entertained.  Our niece had a big grin the whole time.As with any museum or exhibit the weekdays are less chaotic and more enjoyable.  Unless you have screaming, sticky little brats...by all means, please stick to weekends!It's right on Cannery Row so you can enjoy the marine life and then have it for dinner.  Any suggestions on which restaurant?  May want to leave the strip.  We tried Bubba Gump, it was edible, nothing special.  Kids seem to like it.  There are some decent candy shops in there."
3143,2010-08-23,5,"I loved this place!There's a lot to see in here and I haven't seen any Aquarium as complete and well maintained as this one.To get a good head start, I ordered the tickets online.  They are good for 1 year from the date you order them and you can print them right off after you ordered - it was a good feeling to bypass the line of people at the gate.I also researched parking - the cheapest garage is Downtown East with $7 all day.  I spent 5 hours at the Aquarium, 2 hours ocean kayaking, another 3 walking and eating and playing.  Coming from a town with parking money draining out of ya pocket every minute, it's a great feeling I could do so much for $7 bucks parking all day!TIP: it's a $7 one-time fee.  So if you do plan to leave town in a few hours I'd advise you to look into other garages pay by the hour.  But if you do plan to stay the whole day - Downtown East garage is the way to go!"
3144,2010-09-29,5,"This is one of the coolest places you could visit if you're in the Monterey area.  I have wanted to come to this aquarium since I was a small aspiring marine biologist.  It seriously does not disappoint.  My only suggestion is that, if you happen to also have an opportunity to visit the aquarium in Long Beach as well, go to that one first.  Though it is equally amazing, the Monterey one is just so much larger, interactive, and ""wow"".K, so all the exhibits are fantastic.  I was especially a fan of the jellyfish and large fish tank.  They also had penguins seahorses, tropical fish, rays, otters, sea turtles, flamingos, etc.  The list goes on and on. It's just really cool.  I'm finding myself reverting to a child-like excitement all over again as I'm writing this.  If you're anticipating on spending the day here, save the stress and just park in the parking structure across the street.  You're going to pay practically anywhere you park so you might as well park close.  Also, get your hand stamped and venture out during lunch.  There are plenty of shops and restaurants along the row outside the aquarium.  You can even walk down to the water and dip your feet in if you're brave.Go, just go."
3145,2014-09-07,5,"Okay, first of all, how could you not write a four or five star review of this place?! This is definitely a world-class aquarium, and one of the best I've ever been to (You can't beat Shedd Aquarium and Georgia Aquarium, plus I gotta stay loyal to my local, aquarium, The Florida Aquarium).  This is a very unique aquarium, featuring pretty much only animals inhabit Monterey Bay.  I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase tickets online ahead of time because I feel that's important to be as efficient as possible when visiting this place.  Also, they do have a lot of feedings, trainer talks, and other programs throughout the day which are probably all very good, but I feel that if there's a time constraint, skip them because walking around yourself and seeing all the exhibits at your own speed are more than enough. The best exhibits at the aquarium for me were The Open Sea, featuring the ocean sunfish (A.K.A. Mola mola), hammerhead sharks, and a whole lot more, the Puffins exhibit is also great (I can never get enough of those cute puffins!), and the aviary.  For those of you who said in your review that you had trouble viewing exhibits up close because of the large crowd, for my experience, I first of all either waited 60 seconds or less for someone to move over or I just maneuvered my way through the crowd to get as close as possible.  Something that I didn't expect was to see so many wild animals outside from the Wildlife Viewing Station. I saw multiple sea otters, seals, could hear sea lions, and I even say a seagull with its chicks.  Overall this is a great aquarium and a MUST when you're in the Monterey area."
3146,2012-07-11,3,This place was kinda wack. Haven't been back here in like 15 years and prob won't come back till my daughter is a little older. I'd rather spend my money and time at the zoo. Don't get me wrong there was some cool exhibits but we pretty much went through the entire park in 2.5 hours. I think the biggest problem fro me was the price. Kinda pricey for what you get. Would def have more things to do if we brought kids though.
3147,2013-09-07,5,Loved it! It had been over 20 years since I had been to the aquarium so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was amazed at how fabulous it was. The jellyfish exhibit was breathtaking and my toddler loved the play area. We could have spent 2 days here. It is a must see!!
3148,2008-06-15,5,"Doesn't really need another review but...5 stars all the way.  Awesome aquarium exhibits.  Eli's favorites were the waves crashing overhead, the penguins and the BIG tank with the Tuna and the hammerhead sharks.  Only downside was the price is pretty high for a 3 year old to get in.  I have to say that I understand, but I am afraid it really limits access to people with the means.  I would like to see more folks have access to such a great aquarium.  Eli and I got in together for $40.  That is about twice the average cost for an outing for us.  If memory serves (and it doesn't always) it cost the same amount for the whole family to get into the Exploratorium.  That being said, I understand that the exhibits here are probably way more expensive than those at the Exploratorium - I don't know how much one of those huge Tuna or hammerhead sharks  eat in a year, but I am sure it isn't cheap.For kids of all ages this is a must experience.   I LOVED the jellyfish exhibit - just fascinating.  I have never seen a jellyfish alive before and they are so graceful and beautiful - I was so impressed.  Great experience = highest possible rating.Another plus (especially if you have young children):  either Eli spaced out his bathroom needs perfectly or we were never very far from a bathroom the entire time.  This is a big plus when you have the 2-4 year old who isn't always the best at ""holding it."""
3149,2008-10-06,5,"PARKING TIP: Park on the street near the intersection of Foam Street and David Street. Cheaper than the garage, just as safe, and only a block away. $2.50 in quarters got us 2 1/2 hours. PS- The jellyfish are so amazing. Not to be missed!"
3150,2008-07-28,4,"The last time I was at the MBA, I was probably on an elementary or middle school field trip! I'm pretty sure I've been back since but I guess as a surly teenage (and I saw plenty of them) there isn't much you appreciate nor remember apparently. I went on a Sunday during the late afternoon. Parking was a bit of a nightmare, but it's to be expected for the area. The aquarium inside was crowded but we missed all the lines that snaked around the building (thanks to buying our tix online!). Because it was such a nice afternoon, inside was very warm and bit overwhelming with all the people. I forgot how dark it is inside and while it was so beautiful to stand and watch all the fish, it didn't take long for a kid to push you out of the way, a stroller to ram you in the back of the ankles or large groups of people to just walk up and stand right in front of you! It will probably be another 10 years before I come back to visit, but I am so glad I made the trip and got to see and appreciate all wonderful marine life that lives right in my backyard!"
3151,2008-11-21,5,"""Mommy this is just like on Spongebob Squarepants!"" exclaimed my four year old as we entered the Jellyfish exhibit.  I thought his comment was cute but also a great  humongous flashing neon sign  that we need to get out more. duh. When your kid thinks an amazing aquarium looks like a cartoon that's kind of a hint.We thoroughly enjoyed a Monday afternoon at the aquarium. Uncrowded but many volunteers on hand to teach.  Loved it and can't wait to go back.Highly recommend the toddler and preschooler areas.  Our  kids(18 months and 4 years old) totally dug the hands-on stuff. We had to tear them away so we could move on and keep exploring more areas of this huge aquarium."
3152,2010-01-15,5,"First time in Monterey and first day of 4 days trip to Carmel. Amazing beginning for the end of 2009. Thank to a kindness and generosity of the in keeper lady where we were staying, we got free tickets for this marvelous aquarium. Since you first step in you get cautivated for the beauty of the huge whales on the ceiling. As you keep walking there is a huge tank with several sea animals all hanging out together. Ones can see sharks, tunas(very fast animals), mackarels, and so many others that I can't recall right now. Also, they have an otter show, where you can observe -if you get a spot, how they train these otters. There is a big collection of jellyfishes, sea horses, shrimps, and much more. I was amazed for the humongus variety of different animals. My eyes were wide open almost all the time. I recommend this place, if you are in Monterey don't miss it."
3153,2010-07-01,5,"I love the Aquarium! Theyhad lots of things to look at. You can learn more about sea animals then you usually do. It's for everybody to enjoy by learning more. I think they have a coffee shop BUT I'm not really sure. They have a gift shop and tons of parking AND you can look at the ocean view........  you can see misterious jelly fish, fish swim in schools and starfish! I hope you go there soon. Bye!"
3154,2013-07-15,4,"The Open Sea exhibit was unbelievable. An amazing experience all together, albeit a bit crowded. Buy tickets online to skip the long que."
3155,2013-02-21,5,I love this place.  It's not huge but it's not small.  I took both my oldest and youngest over the holiday weekend.  It was very busy but still had a lot of exhibits to see.  My 1 year old loved seeing all of the fish.  Its fun to watch him smiling at all of the sea life.  I was sad the otter tank was not open.  The weather was overcast but okay.  The only thing that is a pain is the parking.  Should have planned better on that since most lots charge $20-$30 for all day.
3156,2015-07-13,5,We've been members for and traveled the world and seen many aquariums and Monterey Bay is by far the best. They have lots of good programs for the kids and adults.
3157,2011-03-26,4,"I love love love the aquarium! But if you are going take headache medication in advance because there are a zillion screaming kids! It was pretty crowded but luckily I didn't have to elbow anyone. Be sure to check out the jellies! Oh, and pet the bat ray!!!!"
3158,2012-08-24,4,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the best Aquarium in the US, from sharks, rays, jelly fishes, and seahorses. Only thing that I wish they had more of was tropical fishes."
3159,2015-10-30,5,"We're from Maryland & we visit the Monterey Peninsula frequently. We always spend hours at the aquarium - it's the best I've ever seen!  We've been members for several years and we plan to continue to support the wonderful work they do!  Don't miss the auditorium presentations & if you can make the time, the behind-the-scenes tours are fantastic.  The Aquarium is a treasure!!!"
3160,2015-10-30,4,"Very cool, but overpriced for a single visit. I'm sure you could spend the better part of a day here, but we managed to see everything in under two hours. Book a behind the scenes tour in advance if you're interested. Couldn't book one for the same day when we walked in 15min after they opened. The exhibits are very nice and large! Loved the otter feeding/training session."
3161,2008-01-02,5,"I love visiting this aquarium - this was my 2nd visit and I enjoyed it even more than the first.  The layout can be a little confusing even if you have a map, but it's nice to just wander around.  Many of the rooms, like the kelp forest, are so dark and relaxing (even with all the kids running around).  My favorite part is the sea otters - you get to watch them play and we caught them at feeding time, which was really cool.  They currently have a ""Wild About Otters"" exhibit going on, which I really enjoyed.  It's great that they added a display explaining what types of seafood are ocean-friendly (avoid that bycatch!) - they even gave us little wallet-sized brochures at the visitor's center."
3162,2016-11-27,5,"What can be said about this world class aquarium that hasn't been said? Parking sucks and if you go to the Sardine Factory restaurant, you can park for ten dollars all day and it's only a block away. I love all the history, the John Steinbeck memorabilia, the great white shark, the jellies, the amazing octopi, and the sardine schools. Best of all are always the otters. They have six and if you can, get to one of their feedings. It is a delight! Cindy's restaurant has delicious clam chowder and they have Boylans handmade sofas on fountain. This is a place you can easily spend all day in and the shark movie was fascinating about all the tracking they are doing to learn about the migration habits of great white they still haven't figured out. I have been to Sea World in San Diego, Marineland when it was around, Legoland aquarium, Long Beach, and Vancouver. This one is the best of the best and the staff is very dedicated to educating the public on how to respect our oceans and its inhabitants."
3163,2007-02-20,5,"Just went here last weekend for the first time in years.. this place has really been upgraded - definitely worth a visit, especially if you have kids, and even if you don't.  I'ts not a bad weekend date spot judging from the numbers of couples I saw.  My wife who is the leader of her own little mommy posse in the Valley, usually rolls here with her crew about once a month thanks to the family pass we got.  Stollers and kids and moms head to the secret side entrance for VIPS and they cruise through probably the best acquarium this side of the Mississippi.  There's nothing like watching your kid's mouth fall open as a 8foot shark swims by 2 feet from his face.  The Tuna and Sunfish are crazy looking.If you have toddlers make sure to check out the Splash Zone on the 2nd floor.  Wow, I'm sounding really old and soft these days.  I need to review a new club or something soon before I lose my street edge..."
3164,2007-08-17,4,"They should rename it the Monterey Bay jellyfish show and store.The kelp is cool and all the schools of little fish swimming in formation.  Who can say no to an otter?Something is missing, I can't put a finger on it.   Sanity?"
3165,2008-02-29,5,"Amazing place.  Used to go here as a child when I lived in Northern California, but this was my first time back in about 15 years.  Wonderful to discover it with my children all over again.  We went with friends who have a membership so we totally scored with parking and admission (nice to skip the long lines).The place is massive and was more crowded than Disneyland.  In fact we were there as part of a group and kept losing each other since it was so large (what did we do before cell phones?)The highlights for me were the Outer Bay Exhibit  and Kelp Forest with the massive sun fish, sharks, turtles and jellies.  I get mesmerized by jelly fish. My kids loved the tide pools and exhibits where they could touch or get close to the rays and other animals.They also love the acrylic tunnel where the waves wash overhead.  The giant octopus and sea otters were shy that day, so they didn't leave a big impression.I was really pleasantly surprised by the food options at the restaurant.  It was crowded and loud, but nicer than the standard fare you usually get at museums."
3166,2008-05-28,5,"i've never seen such a huge shark in person before...and it was my first time seeing so many jellyfish..it was incredible just incredible..I really wish i had a fancy shmancy camera to talk neat photos but o well. The aquarium is a wonderful place to go to on the weekends and parking at the parking lots is actually not that bad...well compared to san francisco it isnt hahahaha....maybe cause i was so excited to go see the aquarium..anyhow though, its a great experience for kids too..well not all kids cause i noticed some kids were really scared and were crying their eyes out...."
3167,2015-10-27,4,One of the best aquariums in the USA.  But has become overpriced.  Tourists should consider getting a 2-day pass from the hotels if they want to come and go as they please at off times and avoid the crowds.
3168,2008-07-09,3,"Great place to bring the kids, horrible place to bring your aging father who can barely walk down the stairs and makes you think that all the screaming children running around may just knock him down....So maybe I'm a little biased?Alright, so the aquarium here is great, it's just that everyone knows about it and it's stuffed with people even at 10am which was when I was there. I almost wished I'd gone at night.I loved the jelly fish exhibit, but thought it would be bigger. I compared it to the one I saw in the Osaka aquarium years ago and it didn't come close. In general I liked the Osaka aquarium much much more. It was cheaper, had a ferris wheel, and was virtually empty when I went there at night. Soon after walking into the Monterey aquarium I told my parents,"" I wish they had adult aquariums and zoos."""
3169,2006-11-16,5,"Pricey entry fee but there is quite a bit to see inside.  I came on a weekday but there's still a crowd in the aquarium.My favorite exhibit is the jellies!  They are so delicate and colorful...it's hard to believe that they are living creatures!  There's also the playful otters that never seem to stop swimming, the impressive white sharks, and the penguins."
3170,2008-05-15,5,"When I was a kid, I used to get DRAGGED here every summer.  At the time, nothing ever changed.  It was the same ol fish every single visit.On my latest visit here, I was pleasantly surprised.  The aquarium looks TOTALLY different.  There is a new fresh water otter exhibit (SO CUTE!), the Jellies are still there, I love the open water exhibit with the sun fish, the touch pool and rays are still there...and the sea otters have a newer exhibit to play in.There were some other new exhibits too, but I was just impressed with the changes they have made.  It's a very kid friendly environment with lots of opportunities to get hands on experiences.I would highly recommend EVERY ONE taking a trip down there!!"
3171,2010-04-11,2,"I last went to the aquarium about 4 years ago.  Enjoyed it then.  Came back in 2010.  I was extremely disappointed in the changes.  Global Warming has taken over this place.  It is beyond ridiculous how this place has turned into a center for propaganda.  They have opened an entire new wing to this place that is a full-blown, political attempt to push Global Warming.   Hey, every zoo or aquarium has always had the little comments about the evils of man and how he treats the animal kingdom.  That's to be expected.  However, what the aquarium has done, is beyond ridiculous.  Honest-to-goodness, you will feel like you are in a North Korean indoctrination camp.  I just wish that politics would stay out of the lives of kids. Worse yet, since Global Warming now rules this place, I noticed that the exhibits are substantially smaller.  For example, I used to love that HUGE fish tank, that had tuna, sharks, and other giant fish in it.  They still have the tank, but they removed about 70% of the fish. Apparently, they don't want the fish to be too crowded.   Totally stupid.  When I finally left, I was thinking, ""Wow, they really don't have too man fish or exhibits to look at anymore.""  No whales, no seals, no walruses, no dolphins.  Nothing.  Sea World is 1000% better. It's sad to see such a previously neat place completely run over by political propaganda."
3172,2012-08-30,5,"I can never get bored of this place, being in here is like being under the ocean with fishes, I never knew that tunas are that big."
3173,2007-09-02,1,"$25? Ok, we saw the baby Great White Shark that may have been worth it, the Otters were fantastic and the big tanks were really spectacular.  Still, for regular admission, $25 is predatory. The first problem: All the conservationist propaganda everywhere you turn. I'm sure most of it is based in truth but if I have pay to sit through that much envionmentalist preaching I want amazing sex with a beautiful hippie goddess afterward, not a bunch of little brown fish that live in the Monterey bay! Fair is fair.Second problem:Limting it to fish and sealife from the bay gets boring. Instead of all the crappy kids activities and fake seafood restaurants to guilt you into not eating seafood (which I did out of spite immediately after!)They could mange some seahorses and other interesting sealife from around the world. Really, nobody cars about perches.Third problem:BAD NEWAGE (rhymes with sewage) music all over the place! Shut that crap off, I am sure the fish hate it too. The living art exhibition is really, really lame. Jellyfish are awesome. We don't need a bunch of bad music and art to point that out. Last, not so much with the aquarium, but with the people: None of those crappy photos you are taking are going to come out. Cut it out. When it says no flash, it means no flash, asshole. Next, kids love aquariums, it was my favorite as a child, but if I acted like these brats I'd be sitting home with my nose in the corner. If your children cannot behave in public, you need to be home with them adminstering the the proper parental response to that inability to behave, not rewarding them them by taking them out and inflicting them on the rest of us."
3174,2015-08-21,4,"Great, small aquarium. Fun to visit for an hour or two. Some displays were large and bright, some were small and intimate. Easy to navigate though there were some areas that were quite dark and difficult to see where you were walking. Large touch tank perfect for kids with lots of room for everyone. Great bookstore/gift shop."
3175,2013-08-21,5,"Definitely a must see. You catch watch different feeding times, for example the otters. The jelly fish display is quite cool too. Great fun for kids and adults."
3176,2012-08-29,5,"I'm obsessed with this aquarium.  The jelly fish and seahorse exhibits are beautiful.  If I lived up north, I would definitely be a member!!!SOME TIPS - GO SUPER EARLY in the morning for a much better experience.  The afternoons are so busy you can barely get up to the glass.Some hotels offer a VIP ticket which is cheaper then general admission.  You don't have to wait in the VERY LONG ticket line and can go back the next day.  There is an evening cocktail hour that I hear is amazing.  (My BFF has been but we did not have time to fit it in!)Stay for the entire feeding show!"
3177,2009-10-01,5,"HUGE exhibits, plenty to do for both kids and adults!  Lots of fish, very easy to get around.  We spent several hours here, felt like we saw everything we wanted to see with no problems, and were very satisfied."
3178,2006-09-24,5,"What else can I say about this place...it's truly breathtaking. Be sure to appreciate all the jellies, not just the famous sea nettles. The giant octopus was cool, too, but he was hiding most of the time.So my main tip for you is to get there after 4pm. You may have to rush before they close 6pm., but there will be less people there and more opportunities for pictures without big crowds that normally crowd around everything during the middle of the day. When we went, we got there at around 10am and then left at 1pm to do the 17-mile drive and returned at 4pm. It was a good way to squeeze a lot of things into one day, actually."
3179,2008-05-19,4,Five stars for CUTE TUMBLING SEA OTTERS who adorably smash their star-shaped ice against glass walls!Minus one star for not having enough CUTE TUMBLING SEA OTTERS!!
3180,2012-06-27,2,"I hate to be 'that guy' but I think this place is overrated. For one thing, tix are $30+ which is really steep for a place this size. I managed to get through most of it in an hour. Also, there are tons of kids, even on a weekday, which makes it hard to view the exhibits w/o being swarmed by pint sized caffeinated booger nosers. And don't even attempt to view the sea otters during their feeding time. You'll be lucky if you get within 20 feet."
3181,2015-10-19,5,Spent the day here with my gf and we had an amazing time and she loved it. I was only disappointed on not being able to see sea horses. My girlfriend really wanted to see one. Also to add to that if you can please add more sea turtles because believe it or not many people come to see them too. I only saw one big one and one small one. Thank You! for an amazing time.
3182,2015-08-16,5,"Really big tanks.you could see animals from around the world!tiger sharks,hammer head,leopard sharks,kelp forest."
3183,2010-06-10,3,"If you are 21 or older, please drink before coming here.There were only TWO exhibits to see at this aquarium that made the ticket worth it: jelly fish and sea otters. The jelly fish will fascinate you and the sea otters will make you smile and giggle and laugh and smile...unfortunately, I was not drunk, so I can only imagine it all in my mind...which is not as fun. The exhibits here are more for adolescents who never grew up watching Nova on PBS or the discovery channel. 1 star for the jellyfish. The sea otters, 2 stars, because one pooed on another one while my girlfriend was posing for the picture."
3184,2013-06-23,5,"Incredible, just incredible.  I love aquariums and have been to many, but none better than this.  Our 2 year old and 6 year old voted, on our last day, to go back and visit again for a second day.  Huge selection of activities for young kids, including lots of hands on activities.  Don't miss the jellyfish and the seahorses.  All of the exhibits are high quality, well done, with great educational material.Go early.  There was already a line at opening time (9:30 am) on Sunday morning, and by noon the line was outside and around the block.We'll be back.  Definitely."
3185,2008-03-03,5,"Too bad the great white shark was not able to survive captivity here... I tthink there are some things in nature that mankind is not able to contain, but that is another discussion for another day.There is no comparison within 100 miles from here (possibly in all of California but I have yet to go to the long beach aquarium).  Even without competition they still run a first class aquarium here."
3186,2007-12-27,4,"This place was pretty cool. The jelly fish exhibit was worth the trip. The problem is though that many people feel the same way. There are crowds of people waiting by the tanks. If you are patient you can get an awesome view of the tanks. The tanks are lighted with blacklights to light up the jellies. They look awesome. They even have two exhibits just for these little guys (""Jellies, Living Art"" and the normal jellyfish tanks).  Another exhibit worth seeing is the otters, very cute but also again most people seem to like this as well. Warning: Very crowded, especially with kids it seems. I have nothing against them, but when they bang on the glass out of excitement and aren't told not to do so, that's when I get annoyed.*I found a Good strategy though for getting a tank to yourself to take a few photos, bait the kids in the other crowds away from the tank you want a photo of,  ""Omg is this jellyfish having babies""  ;-) Their parents follow them too."
3187,2011-10-11,4,"Awesome: the otters, the jellyfish, all the fish.Not as cool: sooooo busy on the weekend, full of screaming children, kinda pricey."
3188,2015-10-08,5,Wow I am always amazed and can't think of any aquarium that comes close to it a true must see
3189,2012-08-30,4,Very nice aquarium. Definitely worth the visit if you are vacationing in the Monteray area. I'm from the Long Beach area of California and really like our Aquarium and I'd say this one is right on par with ours.
3190,2005-11-16,4,The jellyfish are my favourites.  There's also this exhibit in which you can crawl into a cave and stick your head up toward this dome-shaped window.  From the outside it will look like you're hanging out with stingrays.  Sometimes they swim over you and it's an amazing sight.Aquarium gives student discounts and is a fun place to explore.  Afterward you can just chill out on the beach and feed snails to sea urchins.  That's always fun.
3191,2006-08-25,5,"Just went here for the first time last weekend and I love how it made me feel like I was 8 years old.  My boyfriend and I were right up in there with the kiddies, reaching with all our might to pet the bat rays in the touch pool (so awesome!) and pressing all the buttons ont he hands-on exhibits.  We also checked out the 15 minute movie about the baby great white shark they had in captivity for awhile which was really interesting.  My other favorite:  the sea otters.  Those little guys are so animated and full of energy - I could have watched them bat around plastic bins and rub their heads with their little paws all day.  Kind of had the urge to sneak one home with me but I resisted - they are too cute.Anytime you're feeling stressed, I highly suggest simply standing in front of the ""living forest"" aquarium, with the huge stalks of softly lilting seaweed and schools of fish.  Any negative moods will wash out of you within a matter of minutes."
3192,2007-03-22,4,"Fishies..... pretty fishies.... Oh so pretty, pretty, pretty... I loved going here for two reasons: 1) The Kelp Forest exhibit is so peaceful and amazing. Even though we were there on a weekend that was thronging with families of every shape and size and screaming, over-sugared children, parents using terse tones to keep their kids in line and general mayhem, I sat in the bleachers of the Kelp Forest observation area and easily tuned everything out. I had an actual, certifiable spiritual moment here... a minor epiphany. Just amazing. If I ever win the lottery, I'm getting me one of these bad boys in my bedroom. 2) In the ""touch and feel"" exhibit area, there was a Korean dad with his toddler son. The dad had a camera and barely spoke english. The little boy was enthralled with the exhibit where these big eels go swim around and you can reach in and touch them (they're very velvety). Every time the eel would come near the boy, he'd climb up on the ledge of the pool and lean over, sticking his whole arm into the water... The only trouble is, his arm wasn't long enough, so he actually stuck his face in the water to reach the eel. Each time he did it, the dad would look around and proudly announce, in an extremely thick accent, to anyone who cared to listen, ""That's my son!!! That's my son!!!""  You just don't get great moments like that, observing other people's families at their finest moments,  on your average trip to the mall. Minus one star only because I kind of like the Boston Aquarium better... I think the crowds flow better through it because of its circular design."
3193,2007-06-07,4,"I'm totally nuts about fish! I bought my own tank about a month ago and decided to go to the MBA for some inspiration. The fish and exhibits were awesome. They didn't have as many octopus' as i would have liked but we managed to visit him when it was feeding time. The place seemed smaller than i remember it. It took us only 1.5 hours to go through the whole deal (there's 2 floors) but it was 1.5 hours of bliss.I really loved the touching pools, the docents were really knowledgeable and the atmosphere was relaxing. It was sorta like going on a vacation to the sea...corny but true.We stayed in nearby Carmel and altogether had a great relaxing weekend. i definitely recommend seeing this aquarium, they offer student and senior discounts too."
3194,2007-12-27,4,"Very awesome but one good tip: AVOID CROWDED SEASONS!!! Like around Holidays and the summer time. All the kids come out and you know what the bratty kids like to do: squeal, pound glass, push and shove, ""me me me"" attitude.I think they should have a grownups only day or something."
3195,2009-03-22,5,"I come here when conditions are not good enough to dive - yes, in the bay right outside the aquarium - and it is a great compromise for days that I otherwise would've been sitting around in a hotel.Some exhibits are better than others - the Outer Bay is one of my favourites. Tip is to time your visit with one of the feeding times. The volunteer commentator makes educational and quirky - OK, sometimes cheesy - remarks as the tank's fishies are gobbling through 80lbs of food in 6 minutes (and that's because they release the food SLOWLY).The other exhibit I love, which seems to be everyone's favourite, is the jellyfish room. Same reasons other Yelpers have highlighted... this exhibit is simply surreal.There are exhibits i find is a bit of a comprise to being out there yourself... such as the otters, or life in Monterey Bay exhibits. But if you're not game enough to jump into the cold, cold Monterey Bay with scuba gear, it is an excellent representation.Like all aquariums, museums and zoos... if screaming children bothers you, don't go on a sunny weekend day. I wouldn't mark an aquarium down just because they allow kids in. In fact, full creds on maintaining such an entertaining place for both kids and adults."
3196,2009-04-19,1,"So so so overrated! Only come here if you love crowds, tourists, children, and rude people. For the price I expected to see much more sea life and less educational ocean decor (a mural of an animal is not the same as having one!). They really need to limit the amount of people they let into this place at one time. Hello fire hazard! The aquarium is really geared toward children which was such a bummer.The best way to experience Monterey Aquarium is to look at other people's pictures on Flickr."
3197,2006-09-20,5,"Reality checklist: 1.  Most people get so wrapped up by what's / what's not inside, they overlook the simple fact that this aquarium is located in one of the most beautiful places on earth, with one of the richest varieties of marine life just outside.  Appreciate it. 2.  It's a kid-friendly, family-fun kind of place.  Brace yourself and get over it, but I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to smack that moronic dad encouraging his kid to slam his greasy paws against the tank glass... all while taking 5 too many flash photos of the already blinded creatures. 3.  The majority of the aquarium's true operation lies in preservation and research, in which they rank amongst the most supreme in the world.  Budding marine biologists salivate at the prospect of working here, not only because of it's setting. 4.  The creatures on display are simply miraculous.  I could spend hours just watching the seahorses, the giant tortoise, the jellyfish and the otters.  Open your heart and love them, too. 5.  How much for admission??? Pay up.  It's still a fraction of a wasteful Disneyland ticket."
3198,2009-01-19,3,"This place is tiny - in fact it's small as shit, but well-stocked. The views are the best part. Inside, sure - but outside, better. You can see the ocean and turn around and see just what's in it. Now how's that for instant gratification?Pricey to get in, especially for what you get - but there's an overpriced restaurant there that is very good when you consider that you're dining in an aquarium. Quinoa, hallibut and grilled veggies? Yeah, I'll take that! Crowded, of course, but a must-stop on your Touristy Visit to Tourist Town Monterey."
3199,2007-08-11,5,"Amazing place.I have come here often and have enjoyed each experience.I remember as a child I was like ""ooooh"" and ""wow'.Very favorite place of mine in Monterey.I don't have children,but if you do you should make a trip to Monterey and visit the Aquarium because it simply amazing.If you are just hanging out with friends in the area I suggest you stop by here also."
3200,2008-01-09,5,"I fell in love with the Monterey Bay Aquarium way back in 1995 when I was going to school in Monterey.  Over that time it has doubled in size, but has continued on its path of excellence that made me fall in love with it oh so many years ago.  I've been to many aquariums in my years of traveling the United States, and Monterey--to me--is one of the best I've seen.Who couldn't get lost for hours staring into the giant kelp tank?  Who doesn't secretly wish that they could smuggle an otter or a penguin home with them at the end of their trip?  Who hasn't gazed in awe at the giant tank that houses tuna that will quickly quell your desire for tuna fish sandwiches, and (at least inwardly) squealed in glee when you first caught sight of one of the three white sharks the aquarium has captured and studied over the past few years? (If you're lucky enough to visit when one is on display!)  You'd think that that would be enough to make any Aquarium Staff happy, and let them rest on their laurels.But the MBA insists on pushing the envelope.  From their ongoing research into the aquatic world around them, to their awareness-raising ""Wild About Otters"" exhibition to the jaw-dropping combination of art and nature in ""Jellies: Living Art"", the Monterey Bay Aquarium remains at the top of its game, and on the top of many peoples' lists of ""best of"" in the Bay Area."
3201,2010-02-22,5,"THE SECRET LIVES OF SEAHORSES.  Just another reason to visit Monterey Bay Aquarium (but skip cannery row, it's a money pit!).  I swear, you'll be left asking, ""those are seahorses?""  You'll mistaken them for pieces of algae that somehow are able to move...I'm especially happy with our visit because my husband finally got to pet a sting ray and see the rest of BBC's ""Planet Earth"" on Oceans... LIVE.I am now eagerly awaiting the installment of their flamingo exhibit in March."
3202,2015-06-11,5,so many exotic sea food!! it is like a live buffet but i am not sure when they serve the food..? :/ every time i come i have to pay but then the chefs are never there to serve the fish. they have very big tuna that i would like to sample at least
3203,2013-05-01,2,"Ticket purchase experience was poor. The Print Now function did not work at all. When I called, they said this has to do with a blockup popper on my browser. She had no way to send me a PDF for print. The only option is to go to Will Call and have them print. As this is the only option I will do this. She said the Print Now works for some people but not for others. As such, it was a waste of time for me to call and for them to handle the call from me."
3204,2013-07-28,3,"I am between 3 to 4 stars. My family and I used the public free trolley bus to get here from the wharf. The trolley has several stops around Cannery Row and over by the Warf and other places. I would definitely recommend Monterey Bay aquarium to do at least one time. They do exhibit a wide range of sea life. I do recommend catching the Open Sea Feeding. There are touch pools that have starfish, sea cucumbers, decorator crabs and some other little creatures. The one touch pool has stingrays was a bust because the stingrays wouldn't come around to get touched. For the Thursday july 11th we went there seem to be quite a few maybe preschool groups or large groups of young children which seemed to raise the noise level considerably. We spent roughly 3 hours here between the exhibits and looking out over the ocean on back side of the aquarium. If you have AAA and want the discount you have to buy your tickets at a northern California AAA office that carries them, they are not offered at the Monterey Bay aquarium. There is a AAA office I believe five or less miles away."
3205,2008-06-04,5,"Superb aquarium that is exceptionally well tailored to the 10 and under crowd, but still has quiet alcoves and observation areas for those who want to avoid the aforementioned 10 and under crowd.Since we were there with the kids, I'll focus on that.Everything is very accessible to kids.  Most aquarium displays have windows set low so the kids can peer through, and climbing rails so they can give themselves a boost.  The 'Splash Zone' kids area consumed well over an hour - there are so many activities, displays, and play areas that the kids (5 and 2) did not want to do anything else.  Likewise, the touch pools were a big hit - petting sea cucumbers and rays is pretty neat, no matter how old you are.The kelp forest proved a big hit, too - the kids loved watching the fish above their heads.  But the outer bay display overawed them - they were, for at least 5 seconds (an eternity!) speechless.The onsite cafe is ridiculously overpriced, as they tend to be (5 bucks for a soda and a juice box!) but at least they serve Peet's coffee."
3206,2008-10-10,5,"Been here a quite a few times and it just gets better and better. The first time I went was in 1995 and they were in the process of expanding it. I've been a few times after the expansion and it's amazing. What I like about this place is that is that it showcases CA marine wildlife. They have the kelp beds and what typically lives in them. The last time I was there they had a baby Great White shark. Jaws is one of my favorite movies and seeing a real GW in person is pretty awesome. It would be better to see a full grown, but a baby will due for now. They also have an area with some sea otters. These are way cuter than any puppy or kitten. You can view them from the top of the water and then walk down to see them underwater. The newer expanded area is incredible. You can see jelly fish in neon lights that shows off there colors and can see other translucent creatures.They have an amazing view with of the Pacific Ocean. It's straight out of a photo with all the rocks and kelp beds. The aquarium is right on the famous Cannery Row. Highly recommend going to this unique aquarium to see CA marine life and visit Monterey Bay."
3207,2015-07-21,2,"I have been to this aquarium a number of times with my kids over the years. In my opinion, each visit has resulted in higher ticket prices and unrelenting herds of rude and pushy people to wade through just to see an exhibit. Truly a disappointing experience for an adult who just does not want to experience hectic chaos. Last time I will be visiting this smaller version of Disneyland. Very disappointing."
3208,2012-08-31,5,"Family Fun and interactive exhibits. Extensive giftshop. Allows you to be stamped out, go to town, then come back."
3209,2007-08-06,4,"Love this place!  Really enjoyed the jelly fishes.  Beautiful and amazing.  And the sea otters are as cute as ever.Here's a tip...  when it's crowded, stay until the place closes.  Clears up nicely about 45-30 minutes before closing time and you can have another peek at your favorite exhibit sans the crowd.P.S.  I forgot to mention that when we purchased our tickets, the ticket seller guy didn't even say hello, nor smile, nor thank us for purchasing our tickets.  MINUS ONE STAR!"
3210,2008-09-01,5,"The jellyfish (I know, I know...they're called sea jellies) exhibit is finally closing its doors on SEPTEMBER 14, 2008montereybayaquarium.org/…It's been a good 5 year run at the aquarium...my favorite exhibit next to the Outer Bay tank. Went here over the weekend (the second the last night of Evenings by the Bay --complete with wine and live jazz music) to see the beautiful and mesmerizing jellies one last time (inspired some tattoo ideas) and took some pictures of these beauties. I'm gonna miss them!Also, the Outer Bay tank is currently home to a baby great white shark. It's pretty cool to see it swim alongside the other sharks, tuna (i miss the huge, titanic sized tuna they used to have in there...but don't get me wrong, i still automatically think: SASHIMI when i look at them) and goofy looking sunfish. Don't know how long they'll keep the great white in there but it's worth checking out if you have the chance. My third favorite thing at the aquarium is that glass wall/ceiling where the water gushes over it every few seconds. It makes me squeal with joy every time."
3211,2010-08-05,3,"Over-priced and more crowded than I would have imagined.PRICE-$70+ total for me, my wife, and our older child (the younger one was less than 3 yr old so he got in free).  Honestly, I would have felt like it was a better value at around $50 for the four of us.  Not only was admission high, but the food at the cafe was predictably high priced and okay at best.OVERCROWDING-What really made the cost gut-wrenching was the ridiculously high number of people there.  We were there on a Wed in early Aug and the whole aquarium was so crowded that every exhibit had crowds around it.  Granted, you could see everything if you waited just a minute or two, but it was tough and with small kids, and supervision was challenging.PARKINGThere was virtually no parking on site.  There is two hour metered parking, but again, that was pointless when it will take 3-5 hours to really enjoy the aquarium.  Your only realistic option is about 4-5 blocks away in the Cannery Row Parking garage for $1.50/half hour with a max of $18 a day.  It ended up costing $10.50 for us.  There are some small public lots about the same distance from the museum and I think the rate I saw was $10 bucks for the day, which might be a better value if you're planning on exploring cannery row before or after.FOOD6.50 for a large slice of (what seemed like frozen) pepperoni pizza.  Sandwiches had better quality ingredients, but at 8.50, you pay for it.  There is a restaurant and a cafe that are co-located.  We ate at the Cafe and, as with everything else, it was crowded.  After standing in line, and paying too much, we were standing around with two trays of food trying to find a table. RECOMMENDATIONS--Peak season is the summer and it's no joke even in the middle of the week.  I talked to one of the museum guides and he said the best times to avoid crowds were winter months and the local weather is best in late Sept and Oct.-Bring your own food or eat at one of the other restaurants along Cannery Row.  I don't know about the other restaurant prices, but the food quality is probably better.-Bring a jacket there are a few minor outdoor parts of the aquarium and even in Aug it was in the 60's and overcast.-Don't miss the jellyfish, the seahorses, and the kelp forest.  The exhibits really were very nice, even if not enough to justify the ticket price."
3212,2010-09-17,5,"What can you say about the Monterey Bay Aquarium?  It's an exceptionally unique experience unto itself and something just about anyone who lives in the area (or California as a whole) should go do.Since a lot of people give great input to the place itself, I'll focus on a few tips...1. Buy tickets in advance online.You save time, sometimes money, and you don't have to wait in the MASSIVE ticket lines at the front. My wife and friends went on Labor Day weekend and just waltzed in ahead of over 100 people because they have a separate line for the advance ticket buyers.2. Don't plan on a full day.Unless you're the sort who moves really slowly, or has a BIG group, you don't need to be at the aquarium right at opening time.  Got in at 1pm and out at 6pm having seen it all. Tons of photo's and experiences, saw some of the movies, and hit the gift shop while listening to a jazz band playing for the festival.Side note that I know the big shark section is still under construction, maybe I'd take a lot more time once that's back...but I doubt it.Hope everyone has a great experience there!"
3213,2015-04-20,1,"My nephew was visiting from Scotland with his girlfriend and paid $75 yesterday (Sunday) at 4:30pm only to hear a loudspeaker announcement 15 minutes later that the aquarium closed at 5pm. The only words spoken at the ticket desk were ""are you enjoying your vacation?"" and ""what are your plans for tomorrow?"" This is the kind of sleazy business practice i'd expect from a freakshow at a circus, but then again this is a place filled with so called marine biologists who would tell you your carbon consumption and not Fukushima is killing the Pacific - IMHO they truly demonstrated they are charlatans and con artists to two unsuspecting tourists."
3214,2011-09-15,3,"I guess I'm in the minority for this one.  For myself and my husband and two kids (one is under 1 yr so he's free) but $30 per adult and $20 for a kid over 3 yrs and parking...you're looking at $100 for looking at fish!  Not to mention food on Cannery Row.Yes, I understand that MBA is non-profit and it takes a lot of money to keep up a place like this but I personally think my son would have been just as happy seeing fish at the Japanese Garden in San Jose.  There are tons of fish there too - albeit not nearly as pretty and nice as the ones in MBA, but still.  If you have older kids that are really in to fish and learning about marine life I can see this place being more educational.  Maybe it's because I'm more of a doer and not much of a watcher.  I wouldn't mind paying double or even triple this price if I got to put on a wet suit, some flippers and got to feed to fish in that big tank. ;)Don't get me wrong, the place is neat and all, but for $100 I can find much better things to entertain my two kids. If you decide to go anyway and are looking for some sort of discount:-AAA members get a $2 discount per ticket.-Military service members also get a discount so if you are in the military don't forget to ask for the discount.-If you are traveling and staying in the hotels in the area, I believe they have some sort of package deal that offers a discount.-Occasionally...or more like RARELY they will have discounts on their website."
3215,2015-07-13,5,"Must see if you're visiting Monterey, with or without the kids.  Interesting, fun and educational.  Amazing exhibits, some interactive.  Beautiful and convenient location near shopping and restaurants.  Allow 3-5 hours to see most everything."
3216,2010-06-16,5,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? This is an incredible aquarium, great for the whole family. It's educational and entertaining, with special kids' areas that let them touch and feel and splash and have fun.Until I came here, I never understood the fuss about otters. Then I come and--wham! I get it--THEY'RE SOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE!I had to say it.Schedule no less than half a day to see the aquarium; there's enough here to fill a day.Love the free admission for locals, though it seems that about 27 kajillion of my closest friends do, too.Here's a tip: ask a volunteer for explanations. Some of them are more knowledgeable than the staff--and that's what someone on staff told me!"
3217,2010-09-22,5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place..The aquarium was a little small, but worth every penny. The seahorse and jelly fish exhibits were the best. Parking was ok, we had no problem paying since we would be walking the row anyway; it was a perfect ending to our perfect weekend..."
3218,2008-08-03,4,"Great place to spend the day with kids. There are a lot of interactive exhibits and activities and tons of cool sealife they can feel in the touch ponds - bat rays, sharks, starfish and more.  The staff is very, very friendly and took the time to tell my son all about the various sealife he saw and touched.  You can spend a long time watching the sea otters too - they are so adorable!  The penguins are pretty darn cute too. It can get very crowded on the weekends so I would recommend going during the week if you can.  You can see most of the place in about 2.5 hours.  Jellyfish exhibit was very cool.   The Portola Cafe (the full service restaurant) has great food, it was nice for me to sit down and have a ""grown up"" lunch with a nice glass of wine."
3219,2012-06-03,5,This aquarium showcased aquatic creatures from around the area and the oceans.  It is very nicely designed and interesting.  I haven't been to aquariums in a while and it was a real treat for me to see all the sea creatures again.  I happened to be there during a food festival and they were giving out free samples.  This is a place you must visit if you're in Monterey.
3220,2010-03-07,5,"Wow!  This place is so fun and this time we stayed for a record 5.5 hours before our son tuckered out.  He spent a full 45 minutes just staring at the giant tank with the sting rays, sharks, tuna, sardines, etc.  It's so fun to see how the experience for a child changes just in a matter of months each time you go.  He loved the touch tanks this time, too, and insisted on touching every single seastar he saw.  :)  I was surprised there was no line when we arrived at 10:30am....that was nice!  It did wind up getting very crowded around noon, so I'd definitely go before that time. We'll be back in a few months, I'm sure."
3221,2006-04-15,5,"Even with the horrible, panic inducing crowds on weekends the Monterey Bay Aquarium is worth a visit.  Some of the exhibits I could do without (I agree that the penguins look sad and the new shark thing was lame), but I'd go for the jellyfish exhibit alone.  For my family of five it was actually cheaper to buy a family membership than pay the individual admission fees for each of us.  The membership also has some nice benefits like being able to skip the entrance line and getting invites to their special events.  Also, my friends and I used the membership passes a couple of times and they didn't seem to notice that we obviously were not all  family."
3222,2009-08-26,5,"i don't know why i never reviewed this place cuz this is my FAVORITE aquarium of all time. I've even been to this aquarium in Japan that was supposedly the best aquarium in all of southeast asia, and Monterey still beats it by far. It's so big, and the exhibits are so clean and beautifully displayed. i also love how much i learn and am made aware of the ecosystem each time i go there too. when i was a little girl i always wanted to be a mermaid, and would pretend in the pool, but this is my grown-up version of getting to fantasize about that, being engulped in all this ocean beauty. my favorite is the jellyfish, which they used to have an AMAZING exhibit that is now replaced by the Seahorses. Please bring the jellyfish exhibit back Monterey Bay Aquarium!the only thing that's hard is the fact that i love to EAT seafood, and it's a battle w/in myself to learn and try to do the right thing by not eating the fish in the 'red zone' of the Seafood Watch guide. i love the ocean and marine life, so i have to be good! I'm going to try really hard to be good, but there will probably be some slip-ups..."
3223,2015-07-08,1,Heavily priced for what it has got. Very simple exhibits and nothing great about it. It is just like any other acquarium. Definitely not worth the ticketed price. 39.95$ for an adult is way toooo much. We went there reading positive reviews and thought it will be good for the price but terribly disappointed
3224,2007-12-26,4,"- My friend got really hungry for sushi whilst looking at all the fish. - The jellyfish exhibit is the best one to take photographs of. It's a bit difficult to catch great digital pics of the faster-moving sharks in the dark, murky water in rooms which are dimly lit.- Kiddies, splashing your fingers in the water at the stingrays will not make them want to come hither.- And yes, the sunfish is extremely ugly. It looked like 3-4 other fish smooshed into one - a frankenstein of fishes. Everyone who saw it said ""What...is that..?!"""
3225,2012-08-25,5,"even for the non-oceanphile, one cannot fail to find something offascination at the monterey bay aquarium.the jelly exhibition was outstanding & inspiring & a surprising riot of color.the petting tank for baby stingrays was both strange and mind-blowing.the happy staff is tireless & excellent at fielding questions & even dealing with errant children.the short lectures, about 15 minutes each, on jellies, sea otters, and more, are informative & crisply presented.even the steep entry fee, at $30 per adult, is well-spent for such a fantastic museum & general cause: the well-being of the ocean & its inhabitants.  particularly at this trying time of extreme stress for animals.worth a trip even if it is out of your way."
3226,2006-08-02,5,"I love this place. I love marine life. Of course, everyone's favorite is the jellyfish exhibit, where people stand around for hours taking the perfect shot of sea nettles on their digital, but I'd have to say my favorite exhibit is the humongous million-gallon Outer Bay aquarium, with the lazy-ass sea turtles and the crazy-looking sunfish, thrown in with the school of tuna, vicious sharks, and other random sealife. I could sit there and stare for hours, patiently waiting for the sunfish to make its round. Tips: Best to come here on a weekday to avoid lines (and uncontrollable children). Recently, I went on an early Friday morning without having to stand in line. By the time I got out (~1pm), there was a line around the block! And don't forget to bring your student ID for a discount!"
3227,2007-12-02,4,We haven't been here in a few  years. We went this past week during a weekday. No crowds!! I think in the past we use to go during the summer and possibly on a weekend. It's so crowded that the kids don't get to see much. They've changed some. Now there is a loft walkway connecting the two ends on the second floors. I'm glad to see they have 2 new sun fish. But the penguins are gone!!!! grrrrrrrr One of my favorites! And the Outer Bay exhibit was closed! GRRRDefinitely will go back...more often.
3228,2008-12-29,4,"It's been almost a decade since I last visited this place and it's still a great place. The kelp forest is the crown jewel here, no one has one like it and they have an extensive otter exhibit.  They have a beautiful jellyfish exhibit and it's easy to be entranced by these pulsating beauties, like fluttering, fragile, transparent white angels in the water.  Did you know otter droppings are pellet-like?  And that jellyfishes actually inject a barb into you when you're stung & venom is excreted to paralyze you and many can live up to 7 yrs in the ocean?  Or, the giant sunfish gets to be over 200 lbs in it's 1st yr of life and can get as huge as a ton?  It was fun to see the otters groom themselves and tumble in a circle in the water to clean and fluff their rear end.You can get thru the whole place leisurely in 4 hrs.  It was full of families and little kids. I think I got my big toe stepped on no less than 4 times and had to nudge one kid off my toe because he couldn't tell he was stepping on me!  He gave me the ""Why you pushing me, lady?"" look.  The feedings are worth watching especially the otters and kelp forest fishes.  If you stay outside on the deck area, you can spot a cluster of otters hanging onto a kelp and float all day long in the water.   A special treat was the pod of over 20 dolphins frolicking and jumping in the distant waters.  Next year, the aquarium plans to open a seahorse exhibit.  They do a great job promoting sustainable seafood education and political activism to save our oceans.  (Write your state senator to support SB 21)  If you're a AAA member,  you can purchase advance tickets at $2 savings for each adult ticket from an AAA office."
3229,2015-05-17,5,A MUST DO if you're going to be in Monterey!  Fantastic place.  Even the food was good.  Everyone was really helpful and courteous.  I bought tickets on Ebay and saved a bit on admission too. The ocean views are spectacular!   Highly recommend!
3230,2010-10-16,5,"What can I say? The place is located in Cannery Row, a cute little area with little shops and a bunch of photo opportunities.  I love the museum, it's huge! I learn a lot too, and the jelly fish are always, always my favorite.  The only thing I hate about this place is that it's so crowded I can't see anything cause it's full of little children that love to put their grimy slobber hands over anything, push you, scream and cry.  The admission is pretty pricey, but it's totally worth it!"
3231,2010-07-23,5,If you are ever in Monterey you definitely need to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and support them!I love that they use the aquarium to educate the public on conservation of our oceans!Their exhibits are one of a kind! Kelp is very difficult to grow in controlled settings and the kelp in the giant kelp forest tank is 100% real. Previously they temporarily had juvenile great white sharks on exhibit. The aquarium even sets certain marine life back into the wild if they are suitable and healthy.The marine life at this aquarium are all so amazing. If you visit multiple times you get the opportunity of seeing new and different marine species each time.I also recommend supporting the Sea Otter Research and Conservation (SORAC) program. They have done so much in helping the western sea otter population survive from extinction.This aquarium does all that they can to promote and live in a sustainable way in order to preserve the beauty of our oceans!Go check out their seafood and sushi watch guides so you can do your part to live a much more sustainable life!montereybayaquarium.org/…
3232,2010-03-29,4,"I feel bad for the critters being molested all day in the touch tanks, but the jellies, fish, and seahorses are mesmerizing.  I love miniature things, so the dwarf and shrimp seahorses were adorable, and probably my favorite.  I also appreciate their pointing out the detriments of littering and eating unsustainably.The place was built in the 1980s and it shows in the exhibit captions and signage.  As a crowd averse only child turned caustically sarcastic adult, I got much more entertainment out of over-analyzing and poking fun at similar observations about the place than actually getting learned, but I still love seeing the exhibits when I can filter out the sound of screaming/crying babies."
3233,2013-04-04,3,I enjoyed Long Beach aquarium better. This one is more educational for kids.
3234,2011-07-03,3,"Clean, interesting exhibits and shows plus it's easy to find, even if you've never been there before.Parking is difficult in summer and don't expect to see the whole place in 3 hours if you're methodical or want to see every little thing. It's well ventilated, modern and a good place to visit for all ages but pricey and if you're not into sealife it will get boring after an hour or two."
3235,2015-06-30,5,"This place was absolutely amazing! Great for kids, teens and adults. I got to see both the sea otters and penguins during feeding time for no extra charge. This was such a great experience and you get to see them up close, see them interact with one another and learn about the animals. All the exhibits were very cool and it made for a very fun date!"
3236,2011-07-01,5,"WOW! The Monterey Bay Aquarium is beautiful and amazing! Growing up near the ocean I have always admired it! The sea horses, jelly fish and penguins were the best! There are so many different things to see and read. It is right next to the bay so the view is amazing. The only bad thing was children who were not being watched by parents. They made if difficult to read signs and enjoy all the amazing information. Next time I will plan to go in the off season!"
3237,2007-09-04,4,"This is one of the best and most well known aquariums in Northern California.  I have been lucky enough to go here several times without paying a dime for admission.  A friend of mine used to work here so she would put me on ""the list"" so I could explore the aquarium as often as I could.  I even go to go ""behind the scenes"" on a college field trip.  Feeding the seals outside has never been more fun.  You can literally spend hours looking at all of the different exhibits here.  I know my friend said a lot of celebrities visit here too.  See, even people like Gavin and Gwen and Nicolas Cage love sea creatures too.  Just make sure to be in the mood for lots of children, families and other loiterers in the aquarium because it gets really busy, especially on weekends."
3238,2005-12-20,5,"I went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium when it was kids-for-free day. I'm not sure I've ever seen a place so packed. Yet every one of them was totally enraptured by the sea life that makes up the place. This is definitely a place to go if you have kids. From the penguins (who doesn't love penguins?) to the fish petting pond (no, really) to the gorgeous iridescent jellyfish, I think there's something for everyone. The only problem is that if you are like me and love sushi, you'll constantly be thinking about how many maki rolls you could make from one of the huge tuna they have swiming around. Ok, maybe that's just me. My ex-girlfriend slapped me after the second time I mentioned it. Still..."
3239,2013-08-28,4,"My boyfriend and I had a pleasant Sunday morning at the aquarium in Monterey. It was a little bit smaller than what I was expecting, but it was clean and educational. The seahorses and jellies were the biggest hits with us."
3240,2006-08-25,5,Try holding your crushes hand in front of the outer bay tank.  Not usually one to be a cheese-ball---this still got my heart all aflutter.  This place is truly special.  Take a day off some time and come here NOT on a weekend.  Walk slowly through it all.  Loose yourself.
3241,2008-09-07,5,"Conservationists and beyond... this is the single greatest aquarium that has ever been .. in the history of human kind.The otters are cute as the dickens... I can't stop watching them.  After what.. 25 years, I can't stop.The recent jelly fish exhibit is mind blowing. wow.. writing that word... I didn't realize the word fish was in the concept of the animal.  And animal?  It is totally just a blob.  Surely not a fish, at the very least.Anyhoo... GO.  GO NOW.  The cost of the ticket goes to saving the universe, so shutup your face and go."
3242,2005-05-08,5,I can't believe I am the first one to rate this place.  It's amazing!  You will learn a lot.  The jellies are mezmerizing.
3243,2006-09-07,5,"A true legend and deservingly so.  Fantastic exhibits. Lot's of hands on for both adults and kids. One of the finest educational institutions in the nation. See what's new on their website:mbayaq.orgFavorites are otters and penguins.  Great fun watching them and their playful antics.  The outer sea exhibit is inspiring.  They just added a great white shark again (the first one got ejected back to the ocean because it was eating the other fish-imagine that).  Buy your tickets online.  Best to go during non-tourist season.  We went on a weekday in October, and there was hardly anyone there. Take a look at the membership packages if you are able to go several times a year. MBA does California proud!!!"
3244,2008-03-10,3,"Yikes - what happened here. When I was 12 this place was exotic, clean and thrilling. Now it's vintage (not in a good way), smelly, full of kids, and i hate to say it- boring.After seeing the California Academy of Sciences, the Monterey Aquarium  just can't compare.Sure times have changes (and so have I) but man, this place could use a face-lift!"
3245,2006-05-19,5,"I want to live here! I read on their website that they have sleepovers once every couple of months, where you can bring your sleeping bag and sleep under the Jellyfish, or the tuna fish, or whatever other fish you want to sleep under. Isn't that awesome?!I was lucky enough to be here to see the Great White Shark when they had her. That was pretty cool. They also had a shark exhibit in which they played the land shark skit from Saturday Night Live with Jim Belushi. All the more reason to love this place. I could stand in the jellyfish exhibit for the entire day, it's my favorite, but there's so much more to see! Try to go on weekdays or other non-peak times. It can get pretty crowded. Yes it's expensive, but totally worth it. An amazing view of the bay. A great place to go on a stormy day, the waves crash up against the windows and it's absolutely beautiful. This is such a great day trip!"
3246,2006-08-02,4,"The animals aren't the ones in the tanks...Someone mentioned ""no children days,"" and I totally agree. This place was so crowded with little people running back and forth, forever unmoved from the displays, that my mental energy was shifted from learning to walking.I love aquariums and I love anything that has to do with the ocean (I'm from Hawaii), but I don't think I would be as willing to drive two hours just to come here again. I think the hype made me expect too much. I was really looking forward to one of those moving walkways where you're transported under a tank full of sharks and rays, like at Sea World. Those are the best. I also crossed my fingers for dolphins, but wasn't too hopeful. The coolest area is the jellyfish exhibit. They're hypnotingly pleasing to watch. If you have the time, the exhibition shows are also very good.  You also can't beat otters and penguins. The pamphlet says the average time spent here is 3 hours. If you're there to learn, It's not hard to envision spending the whole day at the aquarium. If you're not into learning and don't like to wait for kids to move to see stuff closer, I'd give the whole place about 2.5 hours tops.I still prefer the old Academy of Sciences in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. The marine life area was nowhere as big, but offered a lot in a small area. They even had a whole display of penguins (dolphins at one point). When that place is reopened, it will rule the universe (in terms of learning stuff).The Portola Cafe is actually pretty good. $8 gets you a toasted California Club sub that is much better than Quiznos (but then everything is... stupid subs with your stupid sock commercials...). The restaurant also uses sustainable produce and supplies (no soda lids).The $22 price is fair for the world's supposedly best aquarium. You get $2 off if you're a student. Long lines out the door. Parking lot nearby charges $0.75 per half hour, which is awesome if you're from SF."
3247,2008-09-02,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is to Black Truffle Gnocchi as Baltimore Aquarium is to Chili Dog. I think one of the reasons the Monterey Aquarium is so amazing is because they have such an enormous endowment which allows them to create such breathtaking exhibits (Sea Kelp, Jellyfish, etc.) and integrate science and art seamlessly. I went to the Sea Kelp feeding (scuba diver was able to communicate with the audience via microphone), which is one of the only (I think) living sea kelp exhibits in the world. The kelp grew to about 25 feet, and was home to many sea creatures including bottom feeder sharks. Sea otter feeding was fun - but try to arrive early to get a decent spot. They have touch pools (starfish, sea cucumbers, spikey crabs...)Jellyfish exhibit was by far my favorite...appropriately termed ""living art"". The are really quite intriguing and fun to watch. Jellyfish - the 'new' lava lamp."
3248,2009-05-04,5,"AMAZING!!! the best aquarium I've ever been to! The Jelly fish exhibit is my favorite.. but I couldn't miss the massive deep water aquarium, or the seahorse area, or the octopus, or the otters, or the... get the point? This is a great aquarium!If you can manage to get up early and be there at opening... it's worth it. Try to start out in the jellyfish area and move to the deep water area. Both of those are wonderful to experience when there's only one or two people in the room."
3249,2012-07-27,4,"My family visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium for the first time a few days ago.  Here are some pieces of advice, based on our experience:1) Look for ways to buy advance, discount tickets.  We got ours through AAA and saved about $24.  2) Go as soon as the aquarium opens, even if you are going on a weekday.  We were at the Aquarium from 10am-1pm on a Tuesday in July.  The first few hours we toured were relatively uncrowded, but by noon, the crowds were starting to get unbearable.  I wish we'd been at the aquarium when it opened so we could have seen everything by noon.  3) Reconsider taking toddlers here.  For one thing, it's difficult to get around with them.  The aquarium is vast.  If toddlers walk, they will eventually get tired out and want to be carried by their equally tired parents.  If they ride in a stroller, you will constantly have to be hunting down escalators to get to and from all the exhibits, and will also have difficulty getting through crowds.  Another problem with having toddlers here is that some exhibits are very dark, and it's hard to keep track of a small child in them.  4) Bring quarters so you can park at meters both in Monterey and Pacific Grove (the Aquarium is on the border of the two towns).  The meters in Monterey take credit cards, but the ones in Pacific Grove only take quarters.  There is a parking garage for Cannery Row, but it's a rip-off:  it offers only daily rates, of $20 a day.  That is overkill if you're only going to the Aquarium, and after touring the Aquarium, you will probably be too tired to go anywhere else."
3250,2008-03-17,5,"Considering 292 people beat me to the punch I won't go into detail. All I have to say is that it's 40% less than what I expected to get in and as long as there aren't massive crowds this place is awesome. If the line's out the door, I would think again though.My favorites: the otters, particularly the super laid back one; the feeding show at the kelp forest (I want to be that guy one day), and the view outside."
3251,2010-07-05,5,"Spent the day here with the kids yesterday and had a great time.  We haven't been in a few years and it's always a delight to see the sea otters once you walk in.  That made my heart smile- seeing how happy they are, and they love to delight the kids by doing flips for the kids.  What was really funny was that when we were leaving, we said goodbye to the otters and saw that they found the bucket, so one was hanging out inside the bucket, and other one was leaning against it just chillin'.  So cute!The best exhibits:The seahorse exhibit is amazingLove the jellyfishFlamingos were cutePenguins were funnyLove the anchovies and sardine tankThe music from 6-7 in the lobby with the wine tasting weren't bad either.  8-)I think I'll buy a family membership next time we're here!  This place is very well done and so educational for the kids."
3252,2013-03-22,5,"This place is breath-taking.  The large tanks are what dreams are made of!!  My 3 and 1 year old really love it.  It is just the right size for a few hours of walking around.  If you have little ones and can go during the week, I highly recommend it.  On the weekends this place is CROWDED, warm, and stuffy.  The new additions that they have been working on are really neat!  If you haven't been recently, it's worth checking out again."
3253,2014-11-17,5,"From the first time I got the opportunity to see the first great white in captivity (10 or so years ago) to bringing my little one every chance we get today...This place has been a favorite for years and is nothing short of magical! Especially the jelly fish exhibit! Which seems to change (I have noticed they change things over the years, it's never boring!). My absolute favorite exhibit is hard to pick...but im going with the kelp forest! :) I highly recommend getting a good seat to watch the feeding by the scuba man who will be talking to you from inside the kelp forest. Amazing! I have seen this up close at least 8 times and it never ceases to amaze, entertain or teach me something new. :)  The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I was very impressed with their staffing. They must have great management! My son is also fully enamored and we really look forward to our next visit! THANK YOU MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM for the years of nothing short of EXCELLENT experiences!!! Ps this spot is beyond kid friendly, they really go out of their way for the little.ones! :)"
3254,2013-09-30,4,Great place to take the family. I love watching them feed the fishes in the big tank. My favorite exhibit is the otters!
3255,2009-08-17,1,"Not all its cracked up to be.The day we went it was packed.I think there was a field trip or something.So you're screwed both while school is in because there are field trips,and also when school is out because everyone is taking summer vacations.There werent that many great exhibits when we went.Alot of attractions were closed down.At least  didnt pay.My ex did,since it was my birthday weekend.And I wouldnt have paid anyways.I kinda thought it wouldnt be worth almost $30 a ticket.I can go down to the wharf and be face to face with a sea lion for free and be happy with that.And theres not quite as many people there either."
3256,2013-03-21,5,There's truly no better aquarium in the entire United States of America as it matches for quality the one in Boston but then exceeds the major metro and well funded tax dollar alternatives by providing a geographic location that's daunting.  Without a doubt it's a tourist trap in the middle of a tourist trap but it's well worth it.  If you can stomach the fried food and the taffy you have to wade through entoute then do your best to get this aquarium
3257,2010-05-13,5,This is as good as it gets.  I cannot ever get tired of this Aquarium.  The exhibits are always well thought out and educational while still entertaining.  They have a new Pinkk Flamingo exhibit that is very well put together and provides some key aspects of environmental change - and its effects.  They are doing so much to educate and protect our environment - not just the oceans.  Check out their website too - always fabulous new information and studies being published.
3258,2012-04-06,5,"This is one of my favorite places in the entire world. I could come here every single day and not get sick of it. It's a little expensive but it makes me feel good to know that they use those funds to do so much for marine life conservation efforts. Plan on spending an entire day here so you don't feel rushed. My favorite part is the giant aquarium, I believe it's called the Open Sea, with tuna, sardines, turtles and sharks oh my! One of the most amazing natural things I've ever seen is watching the sardines school and then break apart and come back together when the tuna get too close for comfort. Again, and again, and again..... I also really like the jellies exhibit and the otters. Oh the otters are too adorable for words. I haven't been fortunate enough to see a whale in the Bay yet during one of my visits but the last time I was there I missed it by just 45 minutes. Someday."
3259,2012-12-07,3,"Came here during Thanksgiving day with my daughters. Tickets are expensive just to see the aquarium!  I went on craigslist and got some good deals.  This place is nice for a one time thing. Can't really go for more than once. Once you've seen it, you've seen it all.  The one thing that caught my eye was all the different shapes of jelly fishes they had. I like the Canary Row, nice little street to walk around and check out the different stores."
3260,2009-04-15,5,"This place is amazing!  How cool is it, that it backs up to the Monterey Bay?  Not to mention the views of the bay are pretty damn good.  This is easily THE BEST aquarium I've been to, hands down.  Yes, even better than the Charleston Aquarium.  Monterey Aquarium is like a Bugatti Veyron, and the Charleston Aquarium would be like an Austin Allegro.  No comparison."
3261,2012-11-08,5,"I've been coming here since i was a kid and I still love it. Of course I would love it more if I can be here with no one around, but that's impossible. The crowd can get insane, but everyone seems civil enough to look just long enough and let someone else get a turn. And when I want to snap a picture people usually back up and give me a minute. Even though I think it's pretty expensive to come here, I still give in because I love this place so much."
3262,2010-08-11,4,"We heard about the crowds and arrived before 10:30 to beat 'em. The place was already filling up so I'm glad we didn't wait another 30 minutes. Our goal was sea otters, so we hustled over to that exhibit first, but even then we couldn't get too close what with the kids smashing their little faces against the glass. They really were adorable (the otters) so we left that satisfied.Wandering around more or less randomly we found the enormous variety of exhibits. The deep sea tanks, the tidal touch pools (with awesome employees to explain things), everything was fantastic. But what really stole the show was the jellyfish tanks. It was shockingly serene between the waves of stampeding children. And those tanks, with their soft blue lighting, are built to be photogenic. Between shoving kids we managed to snap a few great photos.After two hours the aquarium was so full that we couldn't even approach the main exhibits. Even in the quieter rooms we still had kids running into our legs. I usually like kids, but this was out of control.Anyway, the aquarium itself was perfect. The only thing that could have improved our experience would have been be a mild oral paralytic, administered to all children on admission, to temporarily relieve them of their vocal cords. Seriously, look into it."
3263,2013-08-10,4,"So we have not been here awhile. Parking is always a major pain. Everybody, bring your jackets, always, even if it is mid-July and 120 degrees in your town next door. When you walk in the place, it looks not that large: a shop, a cafe, and a couple of fish tanks, albeit big. Once you start exploring, you can really spend a day here, get lost, get tired, etc. So they price does not seem that bad after a long day. The cafe, though, they have to do something about. 40 minutes of waiting for a coffee! And then they don't have the sleeves, don't have the lids, don't have your cookies anymore..."
3264,2008-10-16,3,"No distinguishing factors placing it in a league of its own; like any other aquarium I've visited. A word of advice to anyone who desires to actually see any of the exhibits: go on a Sunday morning, when the hordes of mothers backpacking their squealing toddlers are fewer and farther between. And if the photographically-inept aren't wedging in to sabotage your shots by saturating your frame with blinding auto flash,there are photo-ops a-plenty here."
3265,2005-12-13,5,"Really great aquarium! A bit too crowded, but I still love it! It's pretty big, and they have a really fun section where you can touch all the weird ocean animals. Favorites: jellies [OF COURSE!] and the huge tank with the big tuna and moon fish, or whatever they are called [though this is a bit weird for me, I catch myself looking at the tank thinking: ""hmmm, maybe tuna does sound good tonight!""]"
3266,2007-04-13,4,"It's quite possible that I could have spent the entire time watching the otters.  Whenever I feel like I'm about to start stressing,  I just picture myself floating on my back like an otter.  Perhaps I'm knawing on a fish, or playing with my chewie.  Afterwards, I'd probably rub my own belly or take a nap.  I'm totally a good swimmer when I'm an otter; and I love showing off for the pale, curious-looking animals on the other side of the glass. Life is good.Take your time.  Stick around for the feedings.  Stop and read the info on the sealife that looks less-interesting.  It may be a lot more interesting than you think!  Oh yeah, and don't miss the sunfish.  Holy crap, that's a weird fish.  The last thing I was expecting was to see some prehistoric dino-fish swimming around with my old favorites!There's more to experience than the aquarium when you're in Monterey, and when combined with a little sight-seeing and sampling some of the local cuisine, you're in for an incredible day.  Weekend.  Week.  Whatever.  Just have fun, kids."
3267,2008-05-27,5,"I absolutely LOVE this place.Every child and child at heart must experience this aquatic wonderland full of amazing sea life, hands on exhibits, and much more.  Definitely make a weekend out of it if possible, and get there EARLY to avoid big lines.  Better yet become an annual member and avoid the line all together. ****BIG TIP****You MUST take the behind the scenes tour!  For a measly $10.00 per person you will see the aquarium in a whole new exclusive way.  It was definitely the highlight of our visit.  You must make reservations in advance via online or telephone as spots are limited.  Definitely well worth it!  I can't wait to go back!!"
3268,2009-01-01,3,"I almost feel bad giving this legendary establishment only 3 stars. Okay, so the fish were great (obviously), and the Portola restaurant was great ... the problem was the CROWDS. It was crazy!We couldn't get anywhere near any of the feeding times, amazing fish are only so amazing when there's a crowd 3-deep between you and the fish,  and I lost count of people taking flash photos zapping the eyes of poor little seahorses (despite clear signage).Did we choose a bad day? (perhaps the Monday of New Years week was a bad choice) but I've hear mutterings about crowds before.  Is it always that bad? I might give it another go sometime, but not soon.Suggestion for the aquarium: have evening openings for people without kids."
3269,2012-11-02,5,"Amazing and Interesting and fun! I love it here, have seen it many times over the years and love it every time. The newest exhibit, the secret lives of seahorses is spectacular:-) we had a wonderful, romantic day together and we are always impressed by this Aquarium."
3270,2008-04-07,5,"All hail the Sun Fish.  God's little joke on the aquatic world.  Dumb as a post and with all the poise and grace of a large rock the Sun Fish looks like someone cut off the tail of a regular fish and the fish failed to notice.  They have one at the MBA and it instantly became my very favourite fish.  If you have never seen one of these then you must swing by because it really has to be seen to be believed.Monterey Bay Aquarium's ethos seems to be education as well as entertainment.  I like the way they have a very wide range of fishes for you to see and touch!  They have petting pools where you can tickle stingrays as well as dancing Penguins.  I kid you not, they play caribbean music in the Penguin pool and they dance away in perfect time to the music.They also run the excellent Seafood Watch programme.  You can pick up little pocket guides that sit in your wallet (I have mine with me at all times) showing the types of fish we should be eating.  Graded in red (avoid), amber (ok in moderation) and green (go fill yer boots sunshine) categories, I use this to ensure I am respectful for the seafood stocks in the world.In fact I have become so proficient in this I now consider myself a Seafood Watch Ninja.  It does mean though that my friends don't suggest seafood restaurants any more lest I lecture them over their Monkfish."
3271,2013-05-30,5,I've been to this aquarium 3 times.  They don't change much but they don't have to because it's perfect the way it is.  I just wish there were less strollers!
3272,2010-10-11,4,"My experience here was a little different since I came here for a private event. It's a great place for events! I went back on Saturday afternoon to see the seahorses and flamingos. I was expecting it to be busy but WOW.I love that this aquarium is committed to conservation and history of Cannery Row. The only downside (for me) is the amount of technology. I know it's 2010 but I LOVE traditional aquariums and this one has too many displays of movies, I came here to see animals!"
3273,2008-03-04,5,"Lay on the floor....not kiddingLay on the floor by the jellies, the sardines and the BIG Aquarium in the dark with the sunfish.You cant do this on a busy day obviously, but on chillin days this is the best! You get a much needed perspective alteration if you LAY ON THE FRIGGIN FLOOR . You know you want to .....because your momma would have been pissed if you did it as a kid. No I sound like a freak but this Aquarium is great and it is nice to mix it up. So take advantage of the off season and experience the quiet alien world that is found here. There are lots of beautiful creatures and fun exibits.The food here is even decent if not a little disturbing (macking fish at an aquarium just feels wrong)"
3274,2015-02-25,5,Worlds best and a local treasure.I could never tire of the inspirational beauty and opp for education.Saving our Ocean through awareness and sharing the Vast magical beauty of the Water and its inhabitants.nothing better!
3275,2008-03-05,4,"I took a last minute trip to Monterey this past weekend, so of course I had to visit the Aquarium.Don't be discouraged by the long line to buy tickets; it goes quick!!Everything looks so clean and well maintained here.  You'll see beautiful fish, sharks, sea otters (so cute), octopus, the kelp forest, and my favorite, the jellyfish.  They are so beautiful and soothing to watch.  The schools of anchovies were fun to watch too.Don't miss this place."
3276,2011-02-23,3,"A great place to see the marine life. However we went on a bank holiday weekend, the place was packed with families and kids and their stroller. It was difficult to get close to any of the windows. The jellies were great . I am disappointed that the sea otters section was closed.Great for kids, lots of interactive things to do. Would rather go back on a week day to appreciate it better."
3277,2010-11-10,5,"Love this place! Pre-medicate. Great for kids and adults too! My friend had her birthday party in the jellyfish section, it was cute. I love coming here. I have a season pass and it's renewable so you don't have to waste a new card every season. It never gets old and they have new exhibits all the time! I love petting the sting rays, that's my fave. They tease you; pretend like they'll let you touch them then they swim off. It seems all too amusing when you're baked, but nonetheless it's loads of fun!! And please, dress accordingly. No muffin tops or high heels :)Oh, oh, oh, did I forget to mention??? THEY HOLD SLEEPOVERS HERE! Sucks for me, because I have no sleepover-proof stuff since everyone likes stealing my wares lol. montereybayaquarium.org/…WOOOHOOOO!!(And the ""Good for Kids"" question? LOL ARE YOU KIDDING ME)"
3278,2009-09-01,5,"I have loved this place as a child and still love it now. I remember my parents taking us as kids and feeling amazed, I still feel that way today.  We are truly fortunate to have this aquarium so close to the bay area!We came here to see the Secret Life of Seahorses and it was such an adorable exhibit! There was a good variety of seahorses and some that I never even knew existed. The displays were interactive and I love their cameo-like graphic artwork. The seahorses themselves ranged from brown, to vivid colors, to even some that resemble plants. So beautiful!Their other tanks are still so breathtaking. Including the school of fish swimming in circles above you, the vivid variety of jellyfish (so amazing!), and now there is temporarily a great white shark that (only five feet, but still, very cool!) swimming around in a HUGE two story tank with tuna and other sharks. And of course, who can forget the adorable penguins and otters! They are so adorable and they are actively swimming around playing with toys and lounging in buckets. Too cute! One of my all time favorite things at this aquarium is the bat ray pool where you can stand along the edge and pet them if they swim by. It was feeding time and I was so excited but since we were on the edge, none of them were swimming by. Whenever one would come in our direction, the kids in the front would get excited and pet them and splash around and caused them all to swim away. SIGH! Eventually, I had to unleash the inner princess in me and squeeze my way in when I saw the opportunity, pet the ray, and zip right out of splashing kiddie hands! When you can't pet a ray, turn around and head to the pool where there are star fish to be touched. They are cute too!The aquarium map has a schedule of feeding times so you can arrange accordingly. That is really handy and nice to have! Also, if you cant seem to snag a photo of a real otter, you'll be able to go outside and catch some staff members dressed in otter and turtle suits! ;) If you look in the distance, you just may seem some seals enjoying their day laying on some rocks!I am truly thankful that we have this aquarium, makes for a great getaway that's not too far away!"
3279,2012-02-14,5,Still the champion of aquariums. That Packard money is sure being put to good use!
3280,2009-07-13,4,"I visited this aquarium on a saturday in July, so you can imagine how crowded and busy it was. Tons of children everywhere, some crowds in front of choice exhibits, and a bit of a line out front. That being said, I had an absolutely lovely day. You can easily spend a couple of hours here--there is a lot to see! This is a great place for kids because there are learning questions and little games to teach kids about different fish they are looking at. The sea otters were adorable, and can be viewed on two levels, so you see them cavorting underwater as well as floating on their backs, snacking on tasty seafood. Some of the habitats weren't as nice as I have seen at other Aquariums, but the Aquarium in my hometown was recently renovated so I am a bit spoiled by that. The downside here? $29 to get in for the day, ouch."
3281,2010-06-30,5,"I am used to the Birch Aquarium which is super small, but only costs 8 dollars. So, when I went to visit my bff in Monterey and saw the prices my reaction was something like this:""Thirty dollars for an AQUARIUM!?! This is a joke, right?""This aquarium is like Seaworld!! I have never seem such a copious amount of tropical gorgeous fishies! They even have where you can pet the sting rays, which is one of my favorite things to do with my free time. The displays are fantastically done and there are so many fun things to do! Monterey Bay Aquarium is a great time! I am only slightly disappointed that I missed out on the great white shark."
3282,2006-12-17,5,"I took my 5 year old cousin here today.  It was a beautiful cloud free day.  The sun was out and there was a brisk chill in the air.  I totally recommend coming during December.  Today we got prime parking (first row)... and there were NO crowds at all.  My little cousin got to be front row for the shark feedings, the penguin feedings and every other exhibit.  There were not a lot of kids around so she got to stay at the touch pools for a long time and really get to observe everything without a million people waiting in line.She was in heaven.  By the time we left, she magically had ""turned into a Sea Otter"".  =)We had a great time!"
3283,2009-08-30,5,"We were fortunate enough to win 4 tickets to the Aquarium for the second year in a row.  When we heard there was a Great White Shark on exhibit, we high-tailed it down the coast to see their latest resident.Our good luck streak continued as we pulled up in front of the Aquarium.  A primo parking place that even had a little bit of time left on it opened up right in front of us.  Word to the wise: parking is metered, pricey and well-patrolled even on a Sunday.  Be prepared and bring lots of quarters.  $0.25 buys you a whopping 10 minutes, so you will need 12 quarters at a minimum to enjoy a nice visit to the aquarium.There is a long line to purchase tickets, but people who have already purchased (or won) their tickets can walk in another door without a wait.  Our first stop was at the far right of the Aquarium.  The lower level of the Outer Bay exhibit.  This is the best place to view the new Great White Shark - she likes to hang out at the bottom of the tank.  Of course, there are all sorts of awesome fish in there: ginormous tuna, Hammerhead Shark,  Galapagos Shark,  and a brilliant school of anchovies.  I'm not really sure how that school of fish survives, but they swim around unmolested by the predators in the tank.The new Seahorse exhibit is awesome too.  Make sure you carve out some time to hang out in there.  It is located right next to the shark exhibit.  There is so much other stuff to see in here, but with 600+ reviews, I think only the new stuff warrants mention.  This place is very kid-friendly, but keep a close eye on them.  There are hoards of people milling about this place and children can get lost in the shuffle easily."
3284,2015-07-14,5,My wife and I spent the majority of a day at the Aquarium and absolutely loved it.  We were able to be there while the fed the Open Sea exhibit and the staff that were comentating on it did a great job and the whole process was very exiting to watch.  The exhibits themselves are amazing.  This is definetely a spot worth visiting if you are in the area.
3285,2010-09-17,5,"Best freakin aquarium in California. Yes, I said it... and it is found on Cannery Row. There are a handful of restaurants and shops in the surrounding area and in comfortable walking distance so take advantage of that.I've been coming for over a decade and the exhibits never cease to amaze me... from the kelp forest to the adorable penguins. Each exhibit is well crafted and most enjoyable when the kids are in school. The gift store is filled with typical stuffed animals, post cards, etc. as well as unique jewelry and other sorts of souvenirs.They are also pro-active about ocean conservation and research. Being a biology major, I thoroughly understand the importance of encouraging positive steps toward a healthier future for our ecosystems. Spending a few hours at the aquarium is a great way to learn about aquatic organisms!"
3286,2006-07-06,5,"They have a huge tank of tuna just schooling around...HUGE tuna. My husban and I just sat there and drooled at the potential maguro that was to be had. Overall, amazing and surprisingly educational. Great place to get away from the City! Just try to avoid the weekends when it's mad crazy. Go when you can during an off day when school's in session. You might have some exhibits for yourself!"
3287,2007-08-14,4,"I mean how can you write a bad review on an aquarium that was built to educate and show the world what lives under the sea? I mean maybe if they had a mermaid swimming in a tank I'd be a little more inclined to run and stand in line for an hour but no, there were no mermaids..Instead, it was very crowded with lots and lots of families, small screaming children, and strollers. It smelled like germs and was hot in there. I didn't want to touch any hand rails or doors and probably went to the bathroom to wash my hands 5 times. There was also an LOOONG line to get in afterall it was a Saturday, BUT, we had some special membership pass so we got to go in a different door and without a wait!The last time I went here was in high school (like 1995!)and I had just the same reaction this time as I did back then, at first a wow, then a 30 second skimming of the educational mumbo jumbo on the signs and then on to the next thing. I'm just not much of a museum person. I did however like the giant tank with the SunFish in it. Those things are so weird, yet so calming to just sit and watch. They look like solid tons of granite, so it almost makes you wonder how in the world they glide through the water so effortlessly with just a twitch of thier 2 funcky fins. What was hilarious is the 'educational' portion of this tank (because there were tuna's in the tank too) where there was a plastic sushi plate, the can of tuna and the fake grilled tuna steak. It did make me start thinking about sashimi..mmmmm maguro...oh well I had salmon that night instead.Anyhow have fun at the aquarium if you are babysitting, old or on a field trip. I'd rather be in the water swimming around with the fish than staring at them through a tank.  I'll likely pass in the future to go back unless they get the great white shark back.....or a mermaid!"
3288,2007-09-27,4,"I love this aquarium and had the privilege of seeing the juvenile white shark on display.   It was well staffed and clean with very carefully presented exhibits.  I especially appreciated the nod towards overfishing and the historic artifacts from the site's sardine cannery history.  It wasn't as large an aquarium as I had thought it would be, but it certainly is one of the best.  The sea otter exhibit was every bit as good as everyone says.  My only concern was the general lack of parenting skill on display by other visitors.  People, control your damn brats.  They're cute to you, but not to the rest of us.Advice:  School groups hit this aquarium during the week, but are generally out by 2:30 PM."
3289,2009-10-15,5,"Last came here five years ago with my husband, and I thought it was pretty nifty.   This time around we have two kids, so now it just seems awesome!  It did seem a bit pricey.  But I kept telling myself that if we didn't pay admission how could they keep up the good work that they are doing?  It's not like it's a museum with paintings, this is a living breathing museum.  I don't quite remember everything I saw on my last visit, but I swear there are some new exhibits.  I think the Seahorse exhibit is new.  And it was sooo neat!  I love seeing the baby seahorses.  So cute.  It was pouring rain when we went (and yet it was still packed!).  So we didn't get to (or want to) do the outdoor stuff.  My son was so amazed as soon as we walked in.  He's only 4, so he wasn't too interested in learning anything.  My daughter who is 1 also loved it.  I think she just loved walking around and following her brother though.  It's not a ginormous place, but I was surprised at how long it takes us to get through an exhibit.  The kids just don't want to leave.  Towards the end, they were pretty aquariumed out and seemed less interested in seeing anymore fish.All in all it was a good experience, and I'm glad we stopped by on our way back home from SF, despite the storm.  Apparently they are building a new flamingo exhibit next year.  So we will definitely be back to see all the new changes."
3290,2010-06-26,5,"First time back in 15 years Since my first two kids were littleI remembered thinking This was the best aquariumBut I don't remember whyI walked in to see The massive kelp forest tankWhere leopard sharks, fish and eelsWeave and sway through the frondsI took a left and sawA huge reddish-pink octopus6-feet acrossSlithering across its glass enclosureI almost passed the leafy sea dragonsHidden amongst the leavesWith heads like horsesAnd bodies like leafy kelpI stood in awe before the jellyfishGiant pinkish umbrellasPulsing and dancingAgainst a blue canvassWho would have thoughtI'd be entertainedBy 20,000 sardinesMoving...   as one...Til... BANG!! They exploded from one another like buckshotOnly to returnTo their underwater balletI remember now Why the Monterey Bay Aquarium is best Because they don't do ordinaryThey do extraordinary And they do it in such a wayThat when I'm thereI feel comfortableAt peaceAnd at home"
3291,2008-02-08,5,"I find marine life boring, but this place is awesome.  I came here last spring.   One of our group had the Entertainment Book and printed off Buy One, Get One Free coupons, so admission wasn't too bad. My favorite experience was watching the sardines swim around and around (you stand beneath and in the middle of an enclosure...you'll see). Very zen. We were there only a few hours and didn't see their exhibit of seals, but hey, I've visited and now live in SF.  oooo, I also learned about the otters' latrine dance-so amusing.I like their conservation viewpoint and picked up one of their seafood guides.  After that and watching Al Gore present ""An Inconvenient Truth"", I was so tempted to become a vegetarian. Alas, seafood is too delicious (and I'm allergic to soy)."
3292,2009-07-15,3,"My kids 1,4 and 6 y/o loved this place. Every exhibit is cool, especially the jellyfish room. They have shows throughout the day, and plenty of benches to sit in when you get tired. I didn't see a restaurant in the aquarium, but you can get your hand stamped at the exit, eat at one of the dozens of restaurants on the same block, and re-enter. However, for the price of admission, you can get into a theme park like Great America or Six Flags. We spent a little over two hours in the place, and about an hour of that time was ""forced,"" so I could feel that I got some value out of the money I spent. I brought my family here on a Sunday, so the place was packed, (why aren't you guys at church or something?) and if I ever decide to go again, I would probably aim for a weekday morning when there aren't as many people. On another upside, it's located on Cannery Row, and there are some stunning views of the ocean on the boardwalk inside the aquarium. Pebble beach golf course is less than 15 minutes away on the historic 17 mile drive, and a Pebble Beach Golf store is ON Cannery Row.I give this place 3 stars because a. it's way too expensive for a place you spend a couple of hours in, b. there are not enough activities inside for the price to be that much, and c. there are WAY too many people paying the full price of admission for them not to be able to relax the price a little. But I guess you can't put a price on your kids' happiness and learning, and they will get plenty of that here."
3293,2011-05-09,5,"A five star review of this Aquarium does not even begin to show what is going on and how magnificent the experience is. Started in 1984, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a world class exhibit of all things relating to the sea. The current special exhibit is the sea horses, which are unusual piled on strange piled on weird. My favorite was the leaf sea horse, which looks like a piece of yellow spotted kelp floating around in the tank. I am sure in the ocean these creatures would be near indistinguishable from the real stuff. That's the point of camoflage, right?The otters and penguins are also my favorites too. My inner kid loves to pet the sea skates in the touch-pool, and I like the shore birds exhibit. This time I noted there was a heavy environmental message relayed with many of the exhibits. Showing what can be done to help the oceans recover from Human excessive use of the resource and pollution clean up. For instance there is a mass of plastic floating in the Pacific Ocean called the Garbage Patch, and it is now twice the size of Texas in area. Wow."
3294,2013-03-20,5,"Best aquarium I have ever been to, period! I could have stayed the entire day with my daughter but unfortunately could not.  I will absolutely be back.  maybe next time I will arrange a behind the scenes tour!"
3295,2008-04-08,5,"It has been over 10 years since I've been back to the MBA I have to say it was totally worth the $24.95 entrance fee.  All of the volunteers and employees were very helpful and courteous and the exhibits were AWESOME!!!!  If you are in the Monterey area, this is a definite stop to make.  My favorite part was deep sea exhibit.  LOTS of large sharks, tuna and other cool creatures!Just be aware that parking is a issues and go on a weekday if you can as the weekends are packed."
3296,2008-07-14,5,"Love Love Love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! Hands down the best Aquarium around! I haven't been here for years and we decided to go and take our 13mth old with us. I'm still amazed to see all the ocean life in this place...oooh otters, peguins, and jellyfish close up without getting stung! That's a plus! Love seeing the ginormous fish in the deep ocean section. What's not to love.They have a great area for toddlers and babies on the second floor. My lil' man is still a little to young to enjoy all this stuff, but he did find it entertaining seeing all the little kids playing. He enjoyed touching the starfish and seaweeds, but i dont think the lady helping us enjoyed him splashing the water around in her face. OOps!Prices sure did go up since I was here, but soo worth it.adults $24.95, student id saves ya $2 bucks.kids (3-12) $15.95, kids under 3 is FREE!bring the grandparents 65 & over and they are student price $22.95The Jellies living art exhibit is there till Sept 1, so if you haven't seen it...ya gotta go!!"
3297,2008-07-30,3,"My family and I used to go to the Bay Aquarium quite frequently when I was younger.  Going to the MBA was always an adventure...especially with my parents whom are both Filipino and are constantly thinking about, in search of, and eating FOOD.  Filipino family trips to the aquarium were not like your usual visit where one learns about the different sea life in the area, partakes in the exploration tanks, or are even amazed by the kelp forest feedings. No!  When this family goes to the MBA, there is this sick fascination about what would compliment that fish in a dish perfectly...tomatoes, cilantro, and some citrus?  Upon looking at one exhibit, Mom and Dad would spin off into how they would go fishing   and eat fresh fish everyday when they were in the Philippines.  Sadly to say, I seemed to learn more about the various of ways to prepare fish/seafood on my trips here.With all that said, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a fantastic time if you can avoid the mass of children/families during the summer rush.  Parking is a bit of a pain in the ass, but what makes the walk to the aquarium a bit more bearable is Cannery Row where you can buy things like a Sea Otter T-shirt or a glittery Starfish magnet that gives you the current temperature.  All valuable memories in the making, if you ask me.How did my family usually end our trip to the MBA?  I believe we walked over to the near-by Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurant because we all had an intense craving for Seafood.  YUMMY!!!"
3298,2008-10-22,5,"This is one of my favorite places EVER.My friends and I came here last Saturday afternoon. There was almost no line to get in and it wasn't too crowded throughout the place. The only time I would not recommend coming is holiday weekends, because then there can be up to a hour wait just to get in!I put on my ipod and ZENed out as I cruised through the place taking in all the exhibits. In the Kelp forest they have added magnifying glasses to some of the smaller exhibits, like the anemones, so people can get a up-close look at some of the beautiful and fascinating creatures. I pushed through hell of little kids at the Jellyfish tanks and pressed my face against the glass to get a better look. The tanks are lit with fluorescent lights and it helps to see the sinewy, translucent bodies of these incredible organisms. I could watch them float around for hours. Jellyfish are so alien to our everyday life. Watching them makes you appreciate how complex our world is.The big tank has my favorite fish ever: the sunfish! They also ave a huge turtle and a white shark! Per usual, the otters and penguins were adorable. I actually got to watch an otter eat and abalone out of its shell and I tried to cook up a way to kidnap a penguin and take it home for a pet.Coming to the aquarium is an incredible learning experience for kids and adults, alike. Conservation efforts are truly aided by institutions like The Monterey Bay Aquarium. When kids get the opportunity to  experience the unusual and varied natural beauty found in their backyards, I think it makes a huge impact on their young minds about the importance of nature's care and preservation.This is wonderful place that has never gotten old, despite the many times I have come. The Bay Area is a better place for great institutions of learning like this. Fun, fascinating and beautiful!"
3299,2008-12-02,5,"I love this place. I'm a big kid and heart and I  loved all the little exhibits. My most favorite were the jelly fish. I don't know why... being in the dark, surrounded by colorful fish is just relaxing. All the stress disappears when you're here. I love the excitement, being surrounded by water, and seeing all the little kids enjoying themselves. One thing, be prepared for the stinky penguins ( iLOVE penguins, but boy do they stink!) : ) And how cool is the water flushing thing? So cool! haha.. A lot of fun and learning opportunities. They have the most wonderful volunteers and staff. Very passionate about what they do kinda folks. Ask questions, they know the answers. I wanna take my nieces here when they're old enough. Check out the website:http://www.mbayaq.org/"
3300,2009-08-01,3,"I dunno, maybe my expectations were too high: I'm a Marylander and well the National Aquarium in Baltimore is pretty dang deluxe.  And I agree with Riza, $30 a pop and we were also through in about 90 minutes.  If you need to save some bucks, considering checking the listings in Craigslist.  I understand the aquarium issues discounted tickets to the big California employers, so people are almost always selling.My other complaint is that well, there are way too many kiddie exhibits.  We went midday midweek and the rugrats were crawling all over the place.  Seahorse exhibit was interesting and well done but my fav is the jellyfish tank.  Super cool.We found metered street parking ($1/hr) on Dewey near Wave St."
3301,2008-09-27,4,"Aw, I love this place.. ever since I was a kid. Now that I am more grown.. I still enjoy it every time. I love seeing all the beautiful fishes and of course the JELLY FISH.. they're awesome! The exhibits are great for kids, they always have a fun time.There are also plenty of other things to do and see in the area."
3302,2008-09-28,5,"WOOHOO!!! The best aquarium I've ever been to. I wasn't expecting the ticket fee to be the price it was, but oh well... it goes towards a good cause and I'd rather be giving money to establishments like these anyway. LOVED IT here. I will be back with my own children, one day. LOL"
3303,2010-08-30,5,"I love this place.  I love it more than our own Academy of Sciences in SF (sorry).  This place is amazing.  Of course, on the weekend, it was stroller/toddler city - so if you don't want to squeeze your way through the exhibits and avoid stepping on children, go on a weekday.The aquarium is very nicely laid out with lots to see and do for young and old alike.  The various exhibits are done with lots of care and well taken care of.  We were able to get up close and personal with many sea creatures and you really come away with an appreciation of how beautiful life under the surface can be.  We were lucky to see an otter pup playing with his mother close up.  Truly a wonderful place to visit.  Totally different from the 'place with the big tanks' when I saw it as a kid.  This place has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best aquariums."
3304,2008-03-11,5,"I don't think my review can completely cover the excellence of the MBA.I remember when this place first opened...it was a little smaller, a little cheaper, and so was I.  =)I really could spend the rest of my life in the Outer Bay room...peaceful is the only way I can explain it. The huge tuna, sharks, sunfish, sea turtles, barracuda, etc. are just amazing. I was a little disturbed about the new otter exhibit. They were cute, yes. But what is up with all the artifical material in there with these animals? Hmm...I just found it weird that the MBA couldn't throw some real branches and stuff in there instead of carwash scrubbers and plastic hoses. It also kinda sucks that they don't offer discounts to members of other accredited animal institutions...other places like this offer discounts. It's for a good cause though.Keep up the good work though...I'll keep coming back."
3305,2008-09-24,3,"Jellyfish exhibit is eerie; it really transports you. But I did wonder, are they happy in a space with absolutely nothing but water. I mean, arent there usually some other living creatures (like plants) near them in the wild? Perhaps I have revealed too much jellyfish ignorance...Moving on...The building is so well designed. You can stand under these awesome water features--my daughter found water wooshing over our heads more frightening than remarkable. There's also a great area where you  can handle starfish--I dont think the starfish enjoyed my daughter's enthusiasm. We learned not to take them out of water too long or they will never trust you again. When I think back  though, I remember these events from a distance as if  I'm looking at the exhibits through  a sea of backs and arms and strollers. Indeed there were people people people everywhere. I found myself constantly waiting for my chance to make it through the throng of families to the glass.  I would recommend going 1000% if only I could guarantee you there'd be fewer people. Of course, we went on a holiday weekend. This review is totally biased in that experience."
3306,2009-02-05,5,"The newly remodeled aquarium looks fantastic! My daughter LOVES it here. What's there not to love? The sharks, otters, penguins, sting ray, etc. all fascinate her plenty, and then the kiddie areas dotted all over the aquarium made her giddy beyond belief. She was so enthralled by this place, I practically had to drag her kicking and screaming just to get something to eat. It was a good thing there was a cafeteria and restaurant here that served good food. I recommend the cafeteria, since the restaurant was a bit on the pricey side. The only downside that I could see was that it was so far away, but I really can't hold that against the aquarium. FIVE stars it is."
3307,2009-03-14,5,"""Hairy Otter""...the wild about otters took the cake, but touching a sea cucumber was second (who knew they were soft?).Not sure if it's worth $30 (I might have liked it better cause we had free passes), but there were many happy kids running around.I would recommend it for a rainy Sunday."
3308,2010-08-08,4,"Get there when it opens to have about an hour of crowd free time.  Get to the big tank to watch the feeding about 1/2 hour early, either sit upstairs on the benches or sit on the floor in front of the tank.  The docent told me the tank is closing at the end of August, so see it soon!  I really enjoyed the seahorse exhibit and the kelp forest.  It does get awfully crowded, so it can be difficult to see some of the exhibits.  I think it's best to get there early or go later, after 3 or 4pm, when some of the families and double wide strollers have gone home.  The docents are all friendly and helpful."
3309,2007-07-08,3,"It's definitely a good aquarium and you should see it at least once - or whenever your out-of-town friends and family come by.  But it is expensive (I think it is roughly $25/head now) and it is crowded!  The crowds are enough to ruin the whole experience.  I recommend either arriving just at it opens and doing a mad dash through in order to get out by 11 or so, or coming after 5.  One of the workers confided to me that evening was the best time and that the crowds began to wane about 4ish.  I think it is open to about 8 on the weekends, so that could be a plan, too.  For me, next time I visit, it will likely be early on a weekday (though there probably will be a lot of school groups!).Update 10.10.07:  still lousy with crowds, even on a slow day.  Much more manageable after 3, though.  And get tix in advance if possible, so don't have to wait in big line!"
3310,2012-09-05,5,"Although I still feel bad for some of the bigger fishies trapped here, none the less this place is amazing and 10X better than a depressing zoo visit. It's huge, took us 4 hours to see everything. The jelly fish exhibit was the best part, made me wish I could handle taking drugs around so many people."
3311,2008-06-18,5,Everytime we would get a chance about once a year.i will add photos soon & update.
3312,2013-04-15,4,"I loved it, a great experience and the staff is very nice and friendly. But the parking is as expensive as in SF, outrageous and the ticket too."
3313,2008-12-11,5,"Downright impressive. I've been to Monterey a dozen times, but this was the first trip where I had time to check out the aquarium. Glad I did, but I was sad that my wife and 3 year old daughter were not along for the ride. Outstanding layout, and both breathtaking and interactive displays. Great for kids, but very much adult-friendly as well. Can't miss."
3314,2009-03-07,5,"I made a special trip here while visiting family and friends on the mainland.  This is a world class aquarium.  While somewhat expensive (just under $30 for a ticket as of 2/2009), this is a fun, educational experience for adults as well as kids.  Otters, jellies, sharks, penguins, rays.  I could go on and on.  Here are a few tips:-poke around for parking and you might get lucky;  while it was a weekday, I found a nearby lot for $5 all day and didn't have to leave the aquarium to feed the meter-try to grab a late breakfast  or early lunch before you go; while I am an admitted aquarium nerd, I ended up being mesmerized by the various exhibits for close to 4 hours-go outside and enjoy the aquarium's beautiful overlook of Monterey Bay, especially because you might see animals in the wild;  in a relatively short time, I saw a sea otter trying to crack some sort of shellfish for a meal, a seal basking in the sun and numerous jellies floating around"
3315,2007-05-16,5,"This place is, hands down, the absolute favorite Bay Area destination of our family.  We've been members for 8 years now and it's the best (tax deductible!!) money we spend every year.Our recent visit may be one of the best ever.  There's nothing like visiting the aquarium with a curious 2-and-a-half-year-old and seeing it through his eyes.  He sees awe in everything and wants to know what everything is and what everything eats and what everything does.  I wish I could loan him out to all of you to really enhance your visit, but I need him around here to point out the awe in everything else for us, like garbage trucks, garden hoses and ""pineapple trees"".My 8-year-old also had a great visit.  He's been here so many times and we've had visits where he didn't seem that interested in being here, or ones where I felt that he talked me into driving 150 miles round trip just so he could visit the gift shop.  This is the first visit where he could really READ everything for himself.  He kept running up to me with facts about various sea life and was especially interested in the ""Sea Food Watch"" card they prepared to let people know which fish are okay to eat and which fish we should all be avoiding because they are endangered or for environmental purposes.  It was a joy to see a renewed fascination with, and love for the ocean in him.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium exists for this exact purpose and they are pretty darn successful in achieving their goal.  If you are encouraged to love the ocean, you will take care of the ocean."
3316,2009-07-16,3,"Lame. L-A-M-E for an aquarium that advertises so much about wonderful their seahorse exhibit is. $29 is a steep price to pay for hardly any attractions or lack of interactive displays for the kids. There's a jellyfish room, some seahorses, a small corner devoted to penguins, and a tiny display for the Sea Otters which had to be one of the main attractions sadly enough. On a Wednesday afternoon, there were so many strollers and small children running in front of people and smearing their snot filled little hands, it almost made a germophobe out of me. There isn't enough space to accommodate the strollers (that mainly house the sweaters, toys, snacks and blankets), the kids and the noise from the parents telling their kids to behave. Most parents didn't pay attention to the stroller parking signs for the smaller darker cavernous rooms and it made for an awkward time looking into the glass aquariums. It also isn't very stroller friendly in the Otter feeding area when 50 people are trying to crowd around 4 glass windows that hardly give you a peak above the water levels. I'm used to museums and aquariums that require an entire day to explore and at the same time, not cost more than $25 for less than 2 hours of sights. We drove over an hour for an aquarium with such great hype that we were only let down in the end. For an aquarium that's right on the the bay, you'd expect more sea creatures and a better environment for the animals. You don't even get a dolphin show or a variety of exotic fishes. It makes me wonder if there's a lack of funding here or if this is the best the area can offer."
3317,2009-08-13,4,"My Ratings:Quantity - 4 StarsQuality - 5 StarsPrice - 4 Stars Location - 5 Stars Service - 4 Stars My Opinion/Story:For my 200th review, I choose Monterey Bay Aquarium where my husband and I celebrated our 1st year anniversary.  Since we couldn't plan a vacation to another country, we opted to stay in the bay and do some local sightseeing.  I've never been to the aquarium so my husband decided to take me here instead.It was a beautiful day - not to warm and not to cold either.  It's the perfect weather.  We found parking at a nearby parking lot and walked towards the place.  Tickets were a bit pricey but it's understandable since they use that to care for the animals.  The aquarium is quite big and there are so many shows to see.  There's a show almost every hour but also gives you enough time to walk around and see the wonders of the ocean.  It was quite crowded that day being it's a holiday and a weekend, but we managed to see all the attractions.I love the huge aquarium at the center of the building, the jelly fishes, and the anchovies that just keeps going round and round.  There are other attractions that are pretty cool.  You get to touch some and actually get closer to others.  I also love the cool breeze you get when you step outside and watch the ocean.  I love searching for animals in the water.  The aquarium has loads of information and there are always someone willing to explain whatever confuses you.  Alot of interactive things to do so you're never bored.  We didn't eat at the shop inside because they're quite pricey and not much selection.  It's rather odd to be eating something that you just looked at so we decided to venture to town to look for something else to eat.  Overall, our trip was fun.  I'll definitely come back here again."
3318,2010-04-26,5,"Aquariums are one of my favorite things, ever, and yet I hadn't been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in something like 20 years. How is this possible? I was particularly in love with the Bat Ray petting pool, which is still there and still awesome, even if the rays seem shyer than I remember. Honestly, I'd probably hide in a corner all day if I was a Bat Ray in a petting pool.I suggest coming on an off day if you aren't enamored of crowds and if you can manage it - my sweetheart and I went on a Friday and I loved it but found it a bit busy. But then we walked by on Saturday! O my starfish and oyster's garters!"
3319,2007-03-01,4,Wait until your kids are over 4 to come here.  Otherwise it might not be worth the price of admission...The amount of time my son was willing to spend didn't make up for the price tag.I still think it's cool and I'm waiting for him to enjoy the experience.
3320,2010-04-29,5,"The best Aquarium yet built!!   I love it, the science the displays.... it's so beautiful. #1 kelp forest tank#2 open water tank#3 Jellies You have got to go if you haven't been!"
3321,2007-05-14,4,"I absolutely enjoyed my Sunday afternoon visit to this aquarium with my family. I enjoy aquariums and the magnificent sea life you get to see, but I was very disappointed with my previous visit to the San Francisco aquarium. The Monterrey Bay one on the other hand had so much to offer. The whole facility was big and well worth our money.My favorite displays here were the glowing jellyfish, giant tuna, and seahorses. If you ever get the opportunity to stop by here, don't pass it up!"
3322,2007-10-19,5,"The best aquarium in the bay area......a must see if you are in Norcal. My favorites are the jelly fish exhibit and the ginormous 1 million gallons tank of the ""Outer Bay"". I could sit there for hours appreciating sea life."
3323,2008-02-21,5,"My family has a love for the ocean and we just can't get enough of MBA.  ""Aren't you tired of seeing the same exhibits over and over?"" coworkers ask us.  Our answer, ""NEVER!""  In the two years of being  members we've seen so many changes through the aquarium including the new otter exhibit and now we're waiting for the new splash zone opening next month.  We can't wait till our children are older so we can use all the benefits that a membership offers including the sleep overs and tours.  Last year we really gave the aquarium a run for their money by purchasing the member plus package (back then it wasn't much more then the member package) and lending out our 2 passes to everyone we knew and their grandmas.  They must have realized that this is what everyone else was doing resulting in doubling the price plus 10 more dollars.  Today we saw the Albatross for the first time which was awesome.  We were also lucky enough to see a mother otter swimming in the bay cradling her tiny baby.  Every trip has been a new experience and I hope we never get tired of MBA."
3324,2008-07-05,3,"I've been here several times and it's one of the most stunning aquariums I've ever seen. (It had a lot of start-up funding if you know what I mean). It was a bit crowded for  a Tuesday afternoon (4pm) but it was a summer day. It has expanded so there's much more to see. A bit expensive -- four of us (1 adult, 2 students, 1 child) and it was $86.00. We only stayed less than 2 hours. Fun but will wait a few years to go back again."
3325,2009-09-28,5,"They outdid themselves w/ the Secret Lives of Seahorses exhibit.  Def. worth a trip to Monterey.  I also read on the news that they caught a Great White Shark in August 2009, so when we were there, they had someone who would help point it out to us.  Impressive!FYI, the sunfish is no longer there.  It got too big and they had to let it go.  Boo. =(  They told me that they are currently looking for another sunfish to replace the previous one, so... I guess we'll just have to wait."
3326,2010-09-29,5,"If I were a kid, I would absolutely clamor to return!  It'd be like a magical fairyland...a very well-done educational fairyland.  As it is, I'm easily amused so it works out quite well for me visiting the Aquarium!AMAZING.  The kelp forest is stunning and beautiful and I'm happy to have visited the exhibit.  I've never seen anything of the sort replicated elsewhere so far so this was great.  We got there in time to see the fishy feeding at the kelp forest and we stayed for most of it, watching the scuba diver feeding the fishes and talking to us from her mic as well as the volunteer outside the tank in front of the audience clarifying stuff.  The sea otters were notable, as were the penguins.  I'm happy I got to see one of the penguins swimming under water (because the perspective the tank allows us is great.  That really impressed and entertained me (and the little boy who kept squealing with delight in front of me).  Can I just say...I LOVE THEIR EXHIBITS FOR CHILDREN.  I really do.  I swear I bee-lined to most of them, much to the exasperation of my poor boyfriend-creature, who suffered patiently as I flipped through boards or yanked on things and swirled knobs-to-swirl.  They were super fun!  All in all, very impressive and knowledgeable.  They are really pushing a ""green, sustainable"" lifestyle all over.  It was present in several exhibits and we even picked up free mini-pamphlets telling us which fish were more sustainable to order/buy from restaurants/stores, alternatives, and most harmful to the environment.  Go and be a kid again!"
3327,2012-06-12,5,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is famous and it's so obvious why!! this place is amazing and so fun to visit! I'm lucky because I live right up the street and can go any time I want. I feel like the aquarium is pretty big because I'm always discovering something new every time I go. It's very clean and everyone that works there is friendly!
3328,2015-01-07,3,"It was really FUN! We used the guest pass so didn't pay for tickets but it was definitely worth our time. The otters were VERY CUTE, and the exhibits were interesting & educational as well. The thing is, we went on a Tuesday but it was still fully crowded to an inconvenient degree. Try looking for free street parking if you don't mind walking 5-10 minutes. There is plenty, with no time limit. Especially if you are from SF, and are accustomed to continuously searching for parking, then finding free street parking near this aquarium should be a breeze."
3329,2016-06-30,4,"This aquarium was nice but was expecting more. I had always heard such good thing about this aquarium saying this was the best aquarium ever, so I had high expectations. I have been to several other aquariums in Southern California including Sea World, and didn't think this one was better than those. It is also very pricey so thought there should be more. All of the feeding times were very crowded for a weekday. We got to each one around 30 minutes early and then were pushed and prodded by guests who would show up at the last minute. The Open Sea feeding was pretty neat. We also liked the Sea Otter feeding but if you are claustophobic you will be squished up there. We were right in the front on the second floor and could see well. Anyone who showed up last minute for the Sea Otter feeding couldn't see much. We got 2 day tickets for the aquarium from staying at the Intercontinental hotel that were cheaper than one day tickets. That was the only discount I could find besides AAA northern Ca offices. We got there close to 10am and stayed almost until closing at 6pm. We felt rushed in the one day, but my kids can stay at exhibits forever. My kids liked the special Octopus exhibit. They liked the sea otters the best. My son also liked the special summer show that told about fishing in Monterey Bay. My daughter was also lucky enough to spot a whale in the Bay. My 3 year old liked the play areas. My 3 year old liked the Hammerhead sharks. ""shark hammers"""
3330,2012-01-13,5,"Don't stop by if you don't want to hear about how we are destroying the world. Plastic bags, pollution and people are all threatening the world we live in.Walk softly. I especially recommend the feeding times - make sure you get there for morning feedings - the jelly fish, the million gallon tank. So amazing!"
3331,2013-07-18,5,"It is the most beautiful aquarium that  I have been to and I have been to a lot of them. We went there with my family and we had the most amazing time and the kids just loved it so much being able to touch the starfish and other things . It  was the best for all of us and to learn about the fish and how they live and eat was so exciting . I got very sick and the staff made sure that I was ok and took very good care of me and they also gave me tickets for my husband and I to come back any time . The care they give for people and animals is amazing , a must see and do if you are in Monterey CA. . My husband and I plan to go back with my grandson very soon . Thank you staff, you are all amazing :)."
3332,2006-09-07,4,"1. buy your tickets online and save the ridiculously long line2. go during the school year and avoid the family trips3. remember that the aquarium is in the heart of the tourist districtwith these three small things, i think you can absolutely love the aquarium. the place is huge and filled with great exhibits. TONS of hands-on stuff that i would probably get into if it weren't filled to capacity with people that are as tall as my waist. and seriously, i could stare at any of the tanks for hours - the jellyfish - did you know they could be club decorations? (they can light up!) the turtles swimming, the tuna... try as i might, i couldn't get hungry looking at them, but i did get sushi for dinner."
3333,2007-05-19,5,"We are now members of this aquarium.  It was actually cheaper for our family of 8 to buy an annual membership than to buy tickets for just a one time visit.  In addition, a portion of the fees were tax deductible.  We also get discounts at the gift store and on programs that they have.  One of the programs that I want to have my children do is the snorkeling adventure where knowledged staff guides them and teaches them of the local habitants.  I'll write a review when we get to check that off of our list.  The family favorite area is the touch pools.  There is always something more that our family didn't catch the previous visit so we never tire of going.  My favorite room is the jellyfish room.  The kids also love the shark exhibit.  I really recommend a visit if you are in Monterey ....we usually can spend the whole day here."
3334,2008-03-16,5,"This place made my childhood. I'd roll into Monterey in the back seat of my parent's minivan and then spend the rest of my day oggling the fish, otters, jellyfish, sharks, stingrays and other glorious exhibits at the aquarium. You can TOUCH starfish here. It's the stuff that fond memories are made of! Oh, and even though it's been about 15 years, I still want to take an otter home with me every time I see them."
3335,2008-09-07,5,"My family has always frequented the aquarium. It hasn't really changed much over the years, but why mess with perfection? The exhibits are always informative and interesting. I think the current sea jellies one is my favorites.I just advise coming on a week day because the lines can get pretty packed on the weekends."
3336,2010-01-18,5,"After spending more than I care to admit to get my car fixed, I was itching to head outta the city for a day trip this weekend. My first thought was San Diego, but many times I like to go too big. After mother nature decided to throw the coast for a rainy one, my roommate and I decided on Monterey for a visit to the Aquarium. The road trip began with a stop at In and Out... after around 2 hours we ended up on Cannery road which resembled a less crowded classier version of fisherman's wharf in San Francisco. My trip to the Aquarium can be described as a trip back to some of my favorite movies:Exhibit A: Finding Nemo, not only did I see nemo, and most of his friends, but I was also proud to show off my knowledge of jelly fish and how you can bounce off the top of them and not get stung.Exhibit B: The Little Mermaid, no there were no mermaids or mermen (other than ornament ones dressed up like the village people in the gift shop) but there was a sneaky eel that came out of his cave, I gave him a piece of my mind for the way he treated Ariel. Typically the octopus was unfriendly as well. Following my reminiscence I began to view some of my favorite food items... I didn't realize how big Tuna fish actually are, and that is a WHOLE LOTTA sandwiches there. The shrimp and prawns were looking mighty tasty too.. needless to say I also left the Aquarium feeling hungry. In Conclusion:  you are NEVER too old to want to pet the not so stingy sting ray... we all want to get our hands wet and giggle like children when we get to touch its velvety skin! :)"
3337,2011-04-05,4,"This place brings back many memories for me, as it probably does for many other people.As a kid, the aquarium astounded me with the diverse exhibits it has, and i was amazed with the creatures. As an adult, i am still get hit by those feelings as i walk around. I love the aquarium.My only knock on it now as an adult, is the price of the whole experience. Parking around the aquarium is expensive, the restaurant is overpriced, and the gift shop prices are ridiculous. That being said, it is a non profit so it all goes to a good place, but still, it hurts the wallet. Plus, the shark exhibit was closed.Take your wife, take your kids, and take your husband too because everybody loves the aquarium.:D"
3338,2013-06-02,4,"I went on a vacation to Monterey mainly to see the aquarium I went as a teenager and really wanted to go again because I loved my original visit so much. I liked my visit a little less this time around as it appears we came on a school field trip day. A ton of snotty, germ filled, bad mannered and poorly watched kids were running around causing havoc. I came in the morning on a weekday in an attempt to beat the crowds and that failed horribly. I was run into, coughed on, a kid yelled in my ear, I saw a mother breast feeding and a child break expensive items in the gift shop. While this is not the aquariums fault I feel some of these families should have been asked to leave if they cant watch their children. I still enjoyed they aquarium and would just warn future visitors for be prepared for  children behaving badly."
3339,2007-06-04,4,"The 8-year old in me wants to give this place 5 stars, but the much bigger 21-year old me knows enough about money to realize how much a $23 ticket is, so I can't give this more than 4 stars.  Some of the exhibitions are just kind of childish to me, and listening to the announcer leading the penguin feeding was just straight up like watching Sesame Street. I guess that's the price of growing up. The gift shop used to be amazing to me, and I couldn't leave without getting something (I also realize now how much of a brat I was). Now walking around the gift shop just makes me realize how overpriced all that crap is (a $12 face towel with a sea turtle on it? a $53 shirt with a sea otter picture? $4 jellyfish pencils?).That said, it's a place that's pretty awesome still, just even more so when you're a kid. The tanks are surreal, and the tidepool where you get to touch starfish and sea cucumbers and stuff are still great. My favorite animal is the sea skate which swims around in this large shallow pool and you can stick your hand in and hope to cop a feel as it swims by. It's kind of like a sting ray except it's harmless so you don't have to worry about going Steve Irwin in front of the kids."
3340,2013-03-30,5,Came here on Vaca from Seattle. LOVED the aquarium. The jelly fish were mine and my daughter's fav!
3341,2010-06-09,3,"My husband and I came here for our 1st anniversary two years ago and had a blast. We did get a discount on tickets with our AAA membership and we found street parking about 1/2 mile away. Walking for us was no problem especially since it was a beautiful day.Our favorite exhibits were the Jellyfish and the touch pool. Being back at the MBA reminded me of my elementary school field trip and took me back to my enjoyable childhood experience.Why only 3 stars? Well, being from San Francisco I'm a little biased and think that our California Academy of Science in Golden Gate Park is awesome! Yes, even more awesome than Monterey."
3342,2010-08-28,4,"This place is spectacular.  They've got enough new exhibits to keep it interesting for repeat visitors.  And there are plenty of demos, and kid friendly displays.  That's not to say that adults won't enjoy it, too.The jellyfish exhibit never ceases to amaze me, and there was a giant tank with anchovies(?) and sharks swimming around.  That was my favorite attraction.  The glass is floor to ceiling, which is two stories, and angled inward slightly from the ground up, giving a feeling of immersion.  To watch those sardines(?) swim around in a giant school, switching direction every few seconds is truly mesmerizing."
3343,2006-08-23,4,It has been quite some time since the last time I have gone but this is truly a fun place to visit if you have some extra time!!!  For those who think the aquarium closes at 5pm....it actually closes at 6pm so you don't have an excuse to not go right before an early dinner. I was however a little disappointed the Giant Octopus was not visible or not as GIANT as I had hoped for!  But the best part was watchng the jellyfish exhibit and seeing the HUMONGOUS Sunfish!! IT was sooo funny!  They can grow to be 10 feet long and weigh a ton!!Heard the jellyfish is only a limited time so hurry n go check it out!
3344,2008-05-25,5,"Yes, Monterey Bay Aquarium is incredible. The 1,000,000-gallon tank is incredible, and the jellyfish exhibit is mesmerizing.But what really makes the Monterey Bay Aquarium so incredibly cool is its direct connection to the ocean. The whole aquarium itself sits *on* Monterey Bay, and has lots of outside areas - including a tide-pool amphitheater where you can sit and watch waves crash against the rocks.  The hands-on touch pools in the children's section are directly fed by the sea.  Every volunteer and docent in the place is extremely committed and knowledgeable.The Monterey Bay Aquarium walks the walk of conservation that so many other sideshows (see: Downtown Aquarium in Denver) hold up as a shield for their for-profit activities.Hot Tip: If you are staying in a local hotel, purchase your tickets to the aquarium from the front desk, or buy your tickets in advance online. You'll avoid the always-long line, and hotels offer two-day tickets at one-day prices."
3345,2010-09-17,5,"""What do you expect: Pirahnna feeding, a Titanic exhibit, and Shark Week in tank 3? ""Going to Monterey and not seeing their Aquarium is like going to San Francisco and not trying any Chinese food or going to New York City and skipping Italian cuisine. How un-American is that?I think the accolades and praise heaped on Monterey Aquarium may have given impossibly high expectations for some first time visitors. (I'm talking to you Yelpers who rated the Aquarium 1 star.) What do you expect: Pirahnna feeding, a Titanic exhibit, and Shark Week in tank 3? (Granted that would be the tits.)For $30 ($18 for kids, free for babies/really stunted brats) you get a state-of-the-art, world-class aquarium, with exhibits teeming with sea-life accompanied by soothing, atmospheric music, and numerous educational, environmentally aware attractions that make learning fun. Kids were having a blast.Friendly employees, amazing exhibits, and you'll have an even greater appreciation for the ocean. My friend and I had a lot on our plate for the day, so we ran through Aquarium in just over 2 hours. Highlights included the seahorse exhibit, featuring their cousins the sea dragons (we were like, what the HELL is that?), the adorable sea otters, cool seahorses, beautiful jelly fish, the mesmerizing octopus, and of course penguins. We were even blessed to see 2 cuttlefish procreating! (Cuddlefish!)What are you waiting for? Dive in! (Though not literally into tank 3.)"
3346,2012-01-05,2,"WAY TO CROWDED!There is an overwhelming ""Me First"" mentality at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Rarely do people patiently wait their turn.  Which isn't the aquariums fault, but it is something to be aware of if you have difficulty with crowds.OVERPRICED!The Aquarium is located on historic cannery row, which means everything is obscenely overpriced! There is no ""free parking"" and the aquarium doesn't validate.  Be prepare to spend about $20.00 for all day parking and $30 dollars for admission per person.  If you want to eat anywhere on cannery row... sell your kidney on eBay.Because the Monterey Bay Aquarium is so crowded and overpriced, I avoid it and take visiting friends and family to other attractions.  It's a nice place to see once, but I'd leave it at that."
3347,2008-03-31,4,"This is by far the best Aquarium I've been to. But it does get crowded on weekends so be prepared for loud annoying kids and the mysterious odors that they produce. There were times we couldnt even see anything due to the crowds. The food was expensive and so was everything at the gift shop.My favorite exhibits were the Otters, Penguins and the Jellyfish. They didnt have any seals which was a bummer but you can catch them in the wild nearby."
3348,2009-08-05,3,"I love this place but it's pricey, to be honest. You gotta really love fish, I suppose. I remembered spending a full day there many years ago. This time I took relatives, and we were in and out of there in two hours, so it felt like there was a lot less to see(?). My relatives really loved what they saw, but I'm just not sure it was worth $30 per person, especially if you're dealing with the ridiculous weekend crowds. (Sorry but elbow-to-elbow people while tripping over baby-strollers in the darker exhibits is no fun for me)"
3349,2009-09-16,5,"I've dreamt of seeing a great white in person and this aquarium made it possible- she's beautiful! Worth every dime to see this mysterious and grand creature with my own eyes. The other exhibits were totally eclipsed by the great white, but they were still awesome. I like the layout of the aquarium feels much bigger that it is. They even had a jazz band and free wine tastings the afternoon/evening I was there.Looking forward to doing the ""sleepover"" there soon.The only thing I think I like more about the local Long Beach aquarium is their out door area with the petting ponds.5 billion stars!"
3350,2010-09-12,5,"One of the best aquariums in the country! The exhibits are great and educational. The facility is well-maintained, with high-def tv screens showing video clips that are almost hard to determined if its recorded or real at first glance. My favorite exhibits were the secret life of sea horses and the jelly-fish. It doesn't seem like a big aquarium but it can easily take an entire day to go through. I highly recommend visiting if you're in the area, but keep in mind that when you're done, a lot of the surrounding stores will be closing up shop!"
3351,2009-08-01,5,"Monterey Bay Aquarium holds a very special place with me man.  I still remember being 10 and dazzled by the various forms of sea creatures, and the dodging seagull poop while eating sandwiches on their terrace.  Those were the days.  Anways after all these years I visited again about three weeks ago and this place is still a blast.  Its a ""highly reccomend"" from me, for parents in search of place to take there kids, for educational, interesting fun.  Or if you just rather see all the crazy stuff in the ocean  in real life, as opposed to discovery chanell this place is very cool.Thouroughly a 5 star experience."
3352,2012-04-27,5,We thought the $ 32 admission fee is a bit steep but then found that this was the best aquarium we have ever been to. Highlights are the kelp forest tank and the jellyfish exhibition.
3353,2011-05-19,5,"This place is definitely fun to be at once every two years.  Nothing really changes, but its definitely nestled in a city where you can plan a relaxing weekend vacation if you are in California.  Here for the Cooking for Solutions 2011 and I am happy they are a supporter of sustainable food production and organic foods."
3354,2009-07-19,3,"Ehh... Long Beach is much, much better.   Nevertheless the location of the aquarium is excellent and it's great that people take the time to educate and learn about the ocean and the creatures in the ocean."
3355,2012-07-31,2,"I'll preface my review by saying that aquariums really aren't my thing, though I went to this one because a visitor wanted to.  I love sea life and being able to see some of it up close was cool.  I loved the seahorse exhibits and the giant tank with the sharks and sunfish.  The aquarium store had some neat souvenirs and I picked up an adorable glass stingray ornament. The 2 star review is because of what an uncomfortable hour and a half experience I had while in the aquarium.  It's ridiculously, horribly, unbelievably, unfathomably jam-PACKED with people.  When I say I liked the above-named exhibits, it's because they're some of the only ones I was able to wedge in and get a good look at.  I gave up on trying to see the octopus because of all the pushing and nudging from the crowd.  I didn't even bother walking over to the stingray touch area.   I got shoved in the butt by several children whose parents couldn't have cared less.  It's a shame, because I would totally be content to just watch fish all day if I weren't being jostled around and didn't have screaming kids in my eardrum. I truly don't know if I've ever been in any building quite as packed as this one.  It was horrible.  Maybe they should cap how many people are allowed in the building at once.   And if you aren't familiar with the area, parking is a nightmare.  Just FYI. If you're more patient than I am then maybe you'll have a better time.  And if you're a terrible parent, you'll fit right in and probably love the place.  Personally, it wasn't for me."
3356,2012-07-09,3,"I checked this place out recently and i would say its ok. Place is kinds old and outdated. However, the exhibit is top notch. Place is clean and workers are helpful. I only gave it 3 stars because i think the sf art museum is better and updated. I would only go back if im in the area"
3357,2009-11-01,5,"This is a fantastic aquarium to see Jellies, Seahorses and Sharks. Way to go Monterey. They have managed to make this place kid friendly without dumbing things down. (OK so my husband spent quite some time trying to catch plastic fish with the claw hand in the kids area but we really did appreciate the live shows and people on hand explaining everything).  The cafe serves good quality food (if you avoid the fried menu) at moderate prices and had a pleasant sitting area to eat. It's quite amusing that you can also go into a seafood bar right beside one of the large tanks downstairs. Talk about interactive menu.Sidebar: I notice a lot of people get run out of here by people's ill behaved children. It would be nice to have 16+ evenings or maybe a later 21+ time slot with cocktails? The Academy of Sciences does the latter and it's very popular."
3358,2010-08-30,5,"Now I gotta be honest, a friend let us use her membership card soo we got in for free. I don't even know how much it costs. So this is not in comparison to what I got for my buck.That being said we loved the place. The M.I.L. took so many photos her battery died. And that was after charging it all night. We found the lay out slightly confusing. At the end we got in the elevator with a stranger and can you guess how many times we hit the first floor button trying to find the exit only to have the elevator doors keep swinging open before we figured out we must be ON the first floor? Of course the kind soul that was patiently waiting and watching the doors open and shut told us when we got off that we needed to go to the second floor to leave. I'm sure all the while he was thinking ""idiots"".Love the jelly fish exhibit. Amazing colors against a back drop of blue. The hubby got to pet the sting rays a bunch of times. I stuck to the star fish and other creatures exhibit. Penguins, sharks, otters and more."
3359,2013-05-08,5,"By far the best aquarium I've ever been to. As a child it was my dream to train Shamu, and walking under the life size orca whales suspended from the ceiling made my dreams came bubbling back to the surface. This is beautifully appointed aquarium with the perfect location right on the bay. You can literally walk out the door and see sea otters and sea lions. I would recommend anyone young or old to stop by and fall in love with the ocean."
3360,2005-05-27,5,This is my favorite aquarium on the West Coast and one of the best in the country. Put the top down or jump on your motor bike and take a scenic ride to Monterey and enjoy this jewel. This is such a beautiful natural and living museum. I promise you will love the time spent here.
3361,2009-11-22,5,"Surface Scuba Dive for kids 8-13 was the coolest thing my boys did on this vacation!  Scuba gear, tanks and all; they got up close and personal with the marine life in the cove.  All the exhibits are beautifully done and the touch pool is so fun for the kids.  We love that Monterey has kept the quaint feel of the town around it even though it's a major tourism spot."
3362,2006-09-16,4,"This is a cool place. Highlights for me: The jellyfish displays, the small fish swimming in a giant circle above your head (sardines?), the penguins and sea otters, and that huge tank with sharks and stingrays and everything else in it.Did a 3-day weekend mistake here once. Will never do that again. Agree with all the others: Do a weekday if at all possible; buy tickets in advance; just be ready for crowds.Take time to wander outside for the fabulous views. Pack a lunch and eat out on the stone amphitheater-like steps overlooking the bay."
3363,2009-11-06,5,"Quite possibly one of my most favorite museums here on the West Coast. There is just SO much to do and see here and all the docents are super knowledgeable and friendly. There's always something new to see and learn here and everything is super interactive so it's a great place to take kids and anyone who wants to learn a little bit more about marine biology. Despite how great all the exhibits are, I couldn't help but notice there was something amiss in the Outer Bay exhibit. Where are all the TUNA? Sea turtles? Or the giant Sunfish? In such a great big tank and all this species missing, it was a little too obvious. The aquarium is looking to remodel this exhibit sometime Fall of next year and possibly will not be completed until 2011. I cannot wait to see this exhibit back and better than ever!"
3364,2010-09-27,4,"I loved the aquarium!  It was my first trip down to Monterey with friends, and we spent the entire afternoon leisurely browsing the place.- Loved seeing the sea otters feeding- Learned a lot just talking to one of the aquarium staff about what kind of fish to eat, and not taking for granted where your sushi comes from.  Did not know the difference between Alaska Salmon VS farmed Salmon!  Couldn't be more perfect for children if you have any."
3365,2012-12-03,4,Huge Octosquishy's and other beautiful fishies! I love this aquarium! The family loved it too!! Would definitely come back again!
3366,2014-05-12,3,Disappointed :( they got rid of the flamingos and seahorses :( parking was $15 for all day. Spent $100 on souvenirs. Spent $105 on tickets and had no discounts for moms on Mother's Day which I don't think is right.. Thy should have gotten some type of discount. I don't think it was right I couldn't see the sea otters because the elevator wasn't working.
3367,2008-03-04,5,"Will write a proper review later. For now just wanted to point out that:- the white shark was set free in the middle of January so its too late if you were hoping to get a glimpse.- new Splash Zone reopens to the public march 17th (march 15th/16th if you're a member - Can't wait). They're bringing back the cuttlefish, blackfooted penguins, seahorses and tropical fishes and theres a new kelp forest display."
3368,2009-04-23,5,"I try to make it down the Aquarium at least once a year.  I just love it.There are some exhibits geared towards children.  I think it's a great idea to get kids interested in wildlife and conservation while they're young.  I only wish parents made an effort to play and learn with their kids instead of just letting them run amok through these special areas (though, the Aquarium can't really do anything about that).This is a great place to come learn about the California Coastal Marine Life and Marine Life from other places around the world as well.  There are exhibits on kelp forests, the outer bay (the sea creatures found way out in the ocean), otters (both sea otters and river otters), jelly fish, penguins, coral reefs, life found on the California beaches (the aviary), rays, touch pools, and a lot more.They also take great care of their exhibits, making them as natural as possible and keeping the animals well fed and happy.  And, I have never seen a dead fish on the bottom of any of the tanks, unlike at other aquariums.I definitely recommend making the trip, even if it's crowded with tourists.  The exhibits are great, the views from the observation decks are great, and the scientific shows are great.  Great.  Great.  Great."
3369,2010-02-18,5,"The BEST place in the bay area as far as wildlife/zoos/aquariums goes. They have something for everyone here. Unique exhibits, such as sea horses, jelly fish, large petting area for the kids (sea cucumbers, strayarfish and rays (stingers removed!) are always a hit with the little ones) and the sea otters are adorable. They have huge tanks with thousands of fish and sharks that you could stare at for hours. Their assortment is beyond anything other local places have. Also they have a large area educating the public on what seafoods are healthiest to eat, mercury content and what is endangered. Gotta love social responsibility.  And finally they discuss what makes Monterey unique as far as oceanic life goes: kelp forests, ocean currents. There is something here for everyone. You can explore science and education, to just sitting and admiring the pretty fish. On top of that they have the standard stuff: You can watch all of their animals being feed at different times of the day. A great gift shop. Best of all it is literally in downtown Monterey! You could spend the day here then walk to lovely restaurants. For a casual meal, Bubba Gumps is right next door to the aquarium. Or you could plan a weekend here! Lots of high end, boutique hotels nearby taking advantage of the beautiful views."
3370,2010-08-22,5,"What an amazing place!I spent all day here. I was a little wary of the small children that ran freely about as they did make many very hands on, touchable exhibits that teach kids about oceans and saving oceans and also what kids can do to save oceans. The touch aquarium part was fun. Rays are actually so soft and silky when they fly under your fingers through the water.I saw the penguins feeding, the kelp forest feeding and the deep water feeding. Fantastic. Their more static exhibits of jellyfish and cephalopods were so enjoyable. I love cephalopods for so many reasons: super intelligence, complex vision, skin that changes color and so much more.Best tour was the behind the scenes tour. I recommend everyone try that.My boyfriend thought of everything! He nailed this place right on the head as something I would so love."
3371,2012-07-09,4,"I think that this is the BEST aquarium in the world (although I haven't been to all of them, I love how beautiful these exhibits are and how you can really tell its a science institute as opposed to a ""human amusement"" institute). They have exhibits of a variety of habitats, but have a strong emphasis on the local habitat and on our footprint. They are known for their science, research, and conservation programs. As someone who works in the environmental and conservation field and has some ethical issues surrounding zoos, aquariums, and in general, keeping animals in captivity, I am in great support of the monterey bay aquarium .  The facility is nice, the animals, for the majority, have lots of space, and the aquarium is very clean and appealing.The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is for a few reasons. First, the price is pretty high. $35.00 for an adult is the highest I have paid for any zoo, aquarium, or museum. Now don't get me wrong, the monterey bay aquarium is not like any old zoo, aquarium, museum, however $35.00 is still very steep. I know I am supporting a good cause, but is another reason why you only come every 5 years or so.The main reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is due to the crowd. The majority of the visitors are families with young children. I like children, but a lot of parents let their kids ""run wild"" and this may mean cutting adults in line, pushing them out of the way, etc. Parents, I paid $35.00 too, please have you kids follow the same polite manners that others are following and have them wait their turn and not pound on the glass or shout.  I agree with Stephanie L's comment below, that they should have an adults only day or night.Another problem related to the crowds is that people go right up to the glass, press their face against it, etc. and are pretty much blocking the whole exhibit for the rest of the people behind them to see. I understand that getting a close look is one of the best parts, but if the aquarium had more people around monitoring exhibits, or put up lines on the ground about 2 feet away from the exhibits asking people to step back, it would improve the experience for everyone. Rather than leaning against the glass, if everyone stepped back about 2 feet then the people behind them could actually see the exhibit (by looking over or between them). I know that the problem stems from the rude attendees who block the glass for minutes upon minutes, but there has to be some sort of system so that everyone gets a chance to see the exhibits! If there isn't going to be a cap on the amount of people that can attend, then there has to be something to keep people in check! That was my main complaint, that I paid $35.00 but had trouble seeing a lot of things.Overall, an amazing aquarium, never regret going! I have gone 5 times in my life and feel as though the exhibits never change, which shows you how great the exhibits are in that you can keep returning and never get bored! I was about to list my favorites and then realized that they all are my favorite! The sting rays (that you get to touch!), otters, penguins, reefs, jelly fish, etc.!My advice is to not come on a weekend and either come early in the morning or in the evening. During the summer they are open until 8pm! We left for lunch at about 3:30pm, came back around 6:00pm, and from 6:00pm to 8:00pm the experience was much more enjoyable because about half of the people had left! You can also park at a metered spot and the aquarium will give you a stamp to leave and come back. Depending on how long you stay, it could save you a lot of money to take breaks, feed the meter, get some food, and come back! Just make sure you get that stamp before you exit! Do keep in mind that the aviary closes at 6:00pm, so we missed seeing the little birdies :( .Another note, this past Saturday they had ""jazz at the aquarium"", meaning live jazz performances, beer, and wine (and free wine sampling!). That was awesome!"
3372,2012-02-27,5,Expensive but amazing.  Everyone else's reviews are pretty much spot on so I won't write tons more just to fill space.  Monterrey is beautiful and the views outside the aquarium make a great place to take pictures.  The only one chintzy piece of this entire aquarium is the fact that I felt that they used anchovy fish as filler fish in very non-descript aquariums.  They put them everywhere because they are eye catching and plentiful.  Poor guys.
3373,2012-03-30,3,"I have to agree with others who have taken issue with the ""hordes of unruly, rambunctious and loud children at every turn."" That is a spot-on description, even on a Tuesday when local schools are not on any sort of holiday. Yes, it's a wonderful place for a field trip; but it would be nice if there was a ""senior time"" or something like that. My grandfather has mobility issues and getting him around the place was a nightmare. For instance, the downstairs part of the otter tank has several steps down. There is a ramp; but one has to search for it and travel to the far side of the tank thru a cafe to access it. The obnoxious children constantly stepped in front of his walker or edged him out of spaces. I recognize the aquarium has no real control over ill-mannered children, which is why I say a senior time, or field-trip-free day would be helpful. In terms of the wonder and beauty of the exhibits and the number of interactive exhibits...the place is top notch! Being able to relax and take it all in, not so much."
3374,2009-09-09,4,"I had been here once with my family when I was about 7 or 8, and was so excited to go again.I went during the special Secret Lives of Seahorses exhibit and it was amazing. I saw seahorses being born, tiny seahorses, large seahorses, glowing ones, etc ...The aquarium itself is very nice, clean, and organized in a way that I know how to get to see what I am interested in, however ..... It was very expensive and not in my opinion worth the ticket price. Student discount is $27.00, but full adult price is $29-$30 which doesn't save me much. There is a lot to see but it is nothing that I think should be $29-$30.HOWEVER ... that is the only negative I have hence the 4 star rating. I wish that there were more food places in the area of the aquarium instead of souvenir shops but what can you do ..The sea otter exhibit was so cute and there are more otters than anywhere else I have seen, even Seaworld. The Jelly fish floor is amazing and not to mention the kidzone that is so cool and definitely worth taking your little one to.  I recommend looking for deals through AAA maybe or coupons in travel books because this aquarium is not something you want to pass up but you should try and save money since eating in Monterey is expensive and so is parking .."
3375,2010-01-09,4,"Parking at the lot out front is pretty cheap.  We saw the sign say $15 maximum all day.  Whoa, you never see that in San Francisco.  I forget the hourly price, but we ended up paying $7 from around 9.30 to 2 or so.  It's not a big aquarium.  We finished it in two hours.  It's very educational and pretty, etc.  Like all good, solid aquariums should be.  It's fun for kids.  As an adult, I would have liked more to see.  Some areas are not stroller-accessible.  Very clean.Very friendly atmosphere.Our kid loved the Splash Zone.My husband did not like the confusing queue system.  We had printed tickets and still had to wait in the will call queue for the personnel to scan our tickets.  The scanner should be at the entry with a sign saying ""Pre-purchased tickets please form line here.""It was fun.  I would come back here when our kid is a bit older."
3376,2010-05-03,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is something everyone needs to see. Depending on the time and day the Aquarium can be a very tranquil place. I highly recommend going after 5pm on a weekday. These are the times that the families with over-sized strollers and 5 kids running in front of you, will not be there. If you are one such family-go any other time and enjoy the fact that your child is not the only one running around and enjoying themselves. To couples and others who wish to experience the exhibits listen to me and go after 5pm on a weekday. I give the newest exhibit 5 stars! I love the focus on global warming. so many people visit the MBA, I think that this is a great way to spread the good word of preserving our planet. My favorite exhibit?? Of course its the Outer Bay with the Sun Fish. I have never seen anything so ugly, yet adorable."
3377,2011-10-05,4,"It has been awhile since I have been to this aquarium and it has yet to disappoint me. This time I got to share it with my husband and bring my 7 year old son.  It was awesome.  I could watch the jellyfish ALL DAY they are so beautiful and peaceful. But really how can you resist the Great White exhibit. They are spectacular creatures. So massive, powerful and downright fierce! We even got to see them feed, which was a treat.  It was a bit rushed as we were in Monterey for other business and had to cut the tour short (3 hours). It was enough time to see all the attractions, participate in a few of the the interactive events, but not enough time to really get into the learning experience of the creatures. If I had to recommend a few things it would be:  1) Look up the best settings for your camera (if your a photo junkie like me). The data mobile service is very spotty so it is difficult to google it on the fly.  2) Comfy shoes and clothes - layers (it's the coast after all). 3) Be prepared to pay for parking. 4) Pack extra patience ;o)  ~ it can be crowded and many people check their common courtesy at the door (if they had any). People WILL push to get in front of you, let their kids barge in front of you or worse yet, barge in front of your kids. People WILL stand for long periods of time in front of the glass even though you and a bunch of others are waiting for them to move on so you can get a peek.  All in all it is worth a day trip or make it a weekend and add Cannery Row and Carmel :O)~Cheers"
3378,2012-01-16,5,"I've been coming to this aquarium for years, and I'm constantly surprised by all the new exhibits they have. I recently came here to see the sea horses exhibit, which was awesome. Clean, beautiful, and spacious, with gorgeous views of the bay. The highlights are the kelp forest, the otters, the jellyfish exhibit, and the open ocean exhibit (with the 50 year-old sea turtles, oceanic sunfish, and huge, bullet-shaped tunas). Plan your trip carefully since it can be super crowded with tons of people taking pictures on their smart phones. Recommend checking out the 15-minute videos in the auditorium and the kelp forest feedings. Parking can be tricky in the immediate vicinity, but are plentiful a few blocks away. Avoid the restaurants in this area, and check out Vivolo's Chowder House if you want reasonable prices and decent fare."
3379,2015-04-20,4,"A little pricey, but an awesome experience for kids and adults. Don't miss the jelly fish or the octopus! Dynomite!"
3380,2007-06-04,4,"Five stars for  the Massive industrial canning sheds converted into a world class aquarium.  Has the most realistic exhibits- sets the standard by which I measure all other aquaria.  Focuses on local ecology primarily, but has other exhibits which connect visitors to other regions on the planet.  The newest additions are the penguins and river otters.  They do a very good job of comunicating with the kids and have enough detail for most adults.  Minus 1 star - Crowds can be overwhelming at times.  I find myself going at odd times to try and avoid people.  I think that the fish in general are well cared for, if a little plump.  The great white shark was quite awesome.  All the fish in the outer bay tank lost 25% body weight from sheer nervous swimming  every time the shark even twitched.  I'll defnitiely be back."
3381,2008-11-10,4,"I love Monterey, CA, so pretty much everything here gets at least 4 stars just for being geographically close.  I had a great time here celebrating my daughter's 13th birthday.  It's costly, so save up your money ahead of time before you go!  I liked the gift shop's selection of unusual things.  It would've been nice to see a few shows or something, but they didn't have any going on that day.  TIP:  go BEFORE the end of September, because starting the first week of October, pretty much everything fun is discontinued because the water gets too cold.  Check their website to see the current events BEFORE you plan your vacation, because you don't want to disappoint the family!"
3382,2009-01-23,5,"Fantastic place. All of the enclosures appeared to cater well for the fish/animals whilst also providing excellent viewing for the general public. The shows/staff were informative and catered to all levels of interest as well as being very well maintained. Many of the exhibits were very impressive on the basis of scale, enrichment, appearance or all three. Great day out.Further tip, if you go down the night before the day your booking was for you get a short preview trip round the whole aquarium before it closes for free!"
3383,2010-11-16,4,"Wow, I'm not normally a person that likes to go to the zoo or place just to watch animals, but this place is really great. My boyfriend suggested that we go here on a Sunday afternoon. I really liked the fact that it wasn't too crowded, and that I didn't run over any children. The exhibits are done very well. They have areas for flamingos, penguins and lots of other stuff. The animals seem to be well taken care of, which is not always the case. It's a little bit expensive for adults (I think 27 with our student discounts), but if you have kids, it would be a great place to spend the day. They also have a coffee shop where you can buy food. We didn't have a chance to drop by there. We were only there about 2 1/2 hours, but it felt like we had spent the whole day there. They stamp your hand for same readmission, which is nice if you decide to leave. I would definitely recommend coming for an hour or two, leaving for lunch, and coming back. It would be a little overwhelming to spend the whole day there. Overall the experience was nice, although I am not too sure how often I would come back. Definitely worth a day trip from the valley tho."
3384,2010-05-04,5,"I love this place! There is so much to see and the atmosphere is amazing!The best part of my visit there was watching this sea horse do some crazy swimming and when I looked closer, he was spitting babies out... there were probably hundreds of little white things swimming around... it was awesome... that father is a trooper... that is the kind of thing you don't see everyday! It was amazing.A little expensive... but awesome!"
3385,2015-04-11,5,Great interactive place  to bring children of all ages visiting from out of town.
3386,2014-12-19,3,I love going to aquariums and Monterey Bay Aquarium is no exception. The only thing prevents from getting a 5 star is the price of the ticket is just outrageous. It is almost as much as going to Disneyland at one time.
3387,2012-08-28,5,Really amazing place!  Be sure to check out the jelly fish and sea horse exhibits.
3388,2013-04-05,5,"I live three-ish hours away, so it's rare for me to go that often (once every 3-4 years). Honestly, I love this aquarium the most out of all the ones I've been to around the world. It's large with so much diversity, and as a child, I use to wander around dazed by how many species of fish, sharks, etc there are there. And of course! The coastline is beautiful. It's hard to explain to out-of-towners why MBA is so famous/expensive (indiv tix are $30 each), but once they go there, they quickly change their minds. I definitely recommend going here at least once in your life. The gift shop and restaurant inside are pretty charming, but parking is a pain in the butt though. And the hours are rather short, so go during the summer!"
3389,2013-02-02,5,"Excellent aquarium! The exhibits are amazing, lots of hands on things for little ones to do. Best advice-if you are moving to the area, buy a membership. We have lived here for a month and have been three times. Also, weekends are a nightmare; kids everywhere, impossible to really REALLY appreciate this amazing place. A nice little hidden bonus was the recreation of Doc's lab. Its an amazing place."
3390,2010-04-17,5,"This was my fourth time to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and I have to say it leaves me impressed.  The facility is beautiful, the staff is energized and attentive, they obviously care a great deal for their aquatic charges, and it makes for a great day trip. Don't miss the Seahorses, Otters, and Jelly Fish.  Take your time, there is more to this place than meets the eye. Ask questions from the friendly staff.  One shocker was the price, it was kind of expensive ($29 per adult), but once you get in the door and see what goes on, and how they keep the place you realize where the money is going.  The aquarium is clearly not a cheap place to run.Go and have fun, but do yourself a favor, pack a lunch, the restaurants around the Aquarium are expensive and not really that good."
3391,2010-07-25,4,"Yessss! It's much bigger than the Aquarium of the Pacific although there's less touch pools which kind of makes me sad! :(It's located around the cute little Cannery Road with touristy shops and food. I think it's around 20-25$ admissions and you get a few dollars off if you're a student. It's actually a really informative place because it educates you on the conservation of fish and the ocean, not just some aquarium you just breeze through with your eyes glancing through the glass. There's a little section for kids too, I believe you go around stamping stuff related to the different ocean life habitats. Yeah, there's also some nice photo opportunities. Monterey bay is nice and the water around the aquarium is beautiful."
3392,2012-01-09,4,"A little pricey, but well worth it if you have never been!  Kids of all ages will enjoy it too, they have touch pools and even stuff for toddlers to play with.  Staff is amazing, very helpful and always has a smile on their face!  We were able to see an Albatross in person that has a permanent home at the aquarium since she can't fly, very interesting!  The auditorium shows are informative and short, which is a plus for all ages!  We went on a weekend and it was crowded, but if you aren't in a hurry (which, why would you be if you plan on going anyway?) you are more than able to wait and get ""to the glass"" on every exhibit.  Will definitely go back again."
3393,2007-08-03,3,"If you live or are visiting the Silicon Valley area, this is a great day trip.Quick Note:    admission is not cheap:  $25/adult   $16/child(3-12)Travel:There are two options from the San Jose area:  1.  taking the 17 to the 12.  taking the 101 to the 156 to the 1.Mapquest or Yahoo or such will tell you Option 1 is the shortest distance, but time wise it takes longer!  The 17 is very twisty, so you're constantly slowing down.  Option 2 is longer distance wise, but is not curvy and has a faster speed limit.  We agreed we'd only take the 101-156-1 route from now on.Fisherman's Wharf:Our first trip to the Aquarium area, we parked downtown and sidled over to Fisherman's Wharf (or as I like to call it:  ""50-different-men-selling-the-world's-best-clam-chowder-street"").  Everyone will claim to have won various clam chowder awards.  Everyone will claim this loudly whilst stirring their pot of chowder on the side of the street.  Chowder review:  delightfully creamy, but slightly chewy clams.  Extra points for the bread bowl.Trolleys:We thought we were at the aquarium site, but no, it's about a mile away from the Wharf.  You may take a trolley from the Wharf to the Aquarium, but I don't recommend it.  The one time we did we waited 45 minutes, and then were packed in like the sardines that used to lose their lives on Cannery Row.  There is a big parking garage around Foam St. and Prescott.  Park here if you can.The Aquarium:The aquarium is beautiful and big and especially full of great hands-on exhibits for kids.  Come prepared to share your personal space with many many kids.  Some of the stand out exhibits are:1.  Vanishing Wildlife:  Outer Bay:  Watch out for the sun fish:  they're so ugly they're cute!2.  Coastal Aviary:  You can get very close to some really beautiful and strange birds.  I particularly love the little ones who swim in circles all day long.  3.  Wild About Otters:  Do I even need to go into how I want to adopt one and have him live in my bathtub?Any downsides?  There are a lot of frisky children running amok, so patience is a virtue.  While the penguin exhibit is okay, it did remind me of the scene in the movie ""Happy Feet"" where all the penguins in the zoo are totally depressed and delusional.  All in all, this a beautiful day trip.  Around the aquarium there are plenty of touristy shops and restaurants.  A great place to bring out of town guests."
3394,2010-04-03,5,"Hands down the BEST aquarium in California.This is as good as it gets. Basically the best and biggest aquarium California and probably even the west coast has to offer. There are so many different species of aquatic life here. The exhibits are big and crowd friendly. Just by the bay, which looks great anytime of the year. Great for all ages. Even if you are not interested in ocean life at all. Just a note though. Everyone should realize that fishes and everything else aquatic are lifeforms too and hate to be bothered just as much as humans. I see way too many visitors tapping the glass and trying to ""scare"" the poor creatures away... That's sad, don't do it. Otherwise, come here to take photos (WITHOUT flash), for school assignments, or just for casual looking. It's great here!"
3395,2015-06-24,5,"Always fun place to come!  There even a tide pool where children and adults can touch (with guidance and certain rules from the docents) the creatures!  I touched a sea urchin, some sea stars, even abalone!  I say children and adults, I always see many children doing, not too many adults!  A few but not too many!  I guess yes I adult but I do look young!  The one big tank, he or she no longer there, but there used be really big mola mola!  Some say HEAD FISH, as if you look at them, mostly head!  I can draw mola mola, mostly head, one big fin on top and one big fin on bottom, squggly line for very short tail!  Did you know femal octopus when she lay her eggs, she cannot eat during that entire time!  Soon after they hatch, she dies!  I asked a docent, he says that the way their hormones are, what happen if you try!  He says they tried feed her a crab, she vomited it!  I guess if I had an eight week pregnancy or nine week pregnancy (give or take of course), without being able eat, I would die soon after!  All that eight week or all that nine week, she very protective of the many eggs!  No wonder she dies within hours after the octopettes hatch!"
3396,2010-10-27,4,"One word: FUN!.  Ok, fine, that's one word and a symbol.If you don't have fun here, then you don't deserve to have fun...ever. Unless, of course, you're deathly afraid of or allergic to water, fish, children, penguins, flamingos, seahorses, otters, sharks (maybe those are legit), jellyfish, kelp forests, walking, stairs, friendly greeters, aquatic information, sea air, the ocean, great views, and FUN!.Just kidding, you don't have to like this place. I hear playing World of Warcraft in a dark, stinky bedroom for hours on end is...FUN?  No offense to gamers.  Just saying. :-P"
3397,2013-03-26,5,"if you can survive driving here from the bay area with young kids on a weekend day, they are guaranteed to have fun. nice friendly staff. Plenty of variety in the sealife exhibits. Expensive store. Plenty of culture and great shopping area right next door. best time to visit in terms of weather is late fall or early spring (oct or feb, march)"
3398,2013-03-25,5,"Amazing.  Seriously, I could spend all day just watching some of the large aquariums inside.  It is a very spectacular place, and way better than I recall from several years ago.  This is a must see!  The value for the entry price is good.  The staff are all extremely knowledgeable and friendly!"
3399,2012-08-14,5,"Very crowded the day we went, but all in all a wonderful aquarium. Love the Otters. I would go early b/c it gets crowded fast. Lots of kids. Very family friendly."
3400,2012-08-13,5,There isn't much else to say besides this is the coolest aquarium in US.  The open sea exhibit is the best part and you can't miss it.  Enjoy!
3401,2010-10-22,4,Great for kids but very touristy. It's so busy here that it's hard to enjoy. Try to go on an off-weekday when it's not so busy and you'll enjoy the many exhibits the Aquarium has to offer.
3402,2010-07-11,4,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BUT PRICEY!I give it five stars minus the $30 admission which I think it is a bit steep and the gazillion gift shops.The sea horse exhibit must be one of the most magical things I have ever seen in my life. I could have gazed at those beautiful creatures all day.  I also loved the playful sea otters and the jelly fish. All of the displays were beautifully and tastefully displayed.  Some of the best exhibits I have seen in my life.  I also loved how the place was filled with knowledgeable volunteers who were ready to answer any questions one might have.This place is filled with information through volunteers, movies, on hand exhibits, signs etc.  What a great avenue to learn fun information!"
3403,2012-11-29,5,The best Aquarium programming ever!  My sun love the feedings and the staff were out of this world friendly.  My wife and I enjoyed it as much as my son and daughter did.  It a bit pricey but well worth it.
3404,2012-10-20,3,"Definitely smaller than I expected.  I have heard that this is one of the bigger aquariums, and oh boy, was I disappointed.Beyond that, I think that this aquarium's exhibits did a good job gearing towards kids' short attention spans."
3405,2008-07-06,4,"Kudos the the curator and team who designed these exhibits! They done such a wonderful job at combining art, technology, science, and education. The Jellies: Living Art exhibit was a highlight as were the sea otters, penguins, and octopus tanks. The giant octopus tank would have been a better experience had it not been for the people taking photos with their flash. Despite the fact that there are clearly signs all around that indicate NO CAMERAS WITH FLASH there were still the few that disregarded it.  At one point I thought that a riot was going to break out. Here is what it was like:(Enter the Giant Octopus) The crowd: OOOOOOOO, AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhIdiots with cameras with flash on: CLICK, POP, CLICKThe crowd: STOP USING YOUR FLASH!!Idiots with cameras with flash on: CLICK, POP, CLICKThe crowd: STOP USING YOUR FLASH!!!!!! STOP! YOU WITH THE FLASH - STOP! At this point the crowd divided. Not by language spoken, gender, race, age or home land but by the flashers and non-flashers. I have never seen anything like it. People were grumbling, yelling, pointing until the flashers group was narrowed down to one. Finally a random man in crowd taps idiot with camera with flash on the shoulder. ""Sir, please stop using your flash, it is frightening the octopus.""Idiot with camera with flash: ""It wasn't me.""Uhhh-hmmm.(exit Giant Octopus) The crowd unanimously groans and walks away. We walk up to the tank after crowd dissipates. The giant octopus returns and displays it's full regalia. New crowd rushes in.The crowd: OOOOOOOO, AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhIdiots with cameras with flash on: CLICK, POP, CLICKThe crowd: STOP USING YOUR FLASH!!Idiots with cameras with flash on: CLICK, POP, CLICKThe crowd: STOP USING YOUR FLASH!!!!!! STOP! YOU WITH THE FLASH - STOP! REPEATThat poor octopus!"
3406,2012-02-11,5,"This place is one of the benefits of living in Northern California. My family went during the special seahorse exhibit ...that was quite fun, amazing creatures.  We visited on a Tuesday so there was plenty of options to park, eat and room to walk. Bathrooms are everywhere and are clean. The staff and volunteers were friendly. The food options inside were good for a quick bite to eat. Outside offers even more options. Highly recommended for families!"
3407,2007-04-12,5,I grew up going to this place almost once a year for field trips in school! I love the sea otters best though....they are like the Golden Retrievers of the ocean! The jellyfish exhibit is amazing....and the underwater sea creatures are fantastic!!!One strange thing about Yelp...when i typed in restaurant and Monterey Bay... Monterey Bay Aquarium showed up amongst the list of eateries. : (
3408,2009-12-27,5,"I can't scream louder about how this is one of my favorite places in the entire world. It is probably one of the best Marine exhibits on earth and every time I have visited, I leave in complete awe of the displays, the creatures and the many incredible, tireless workers that work 7 days a week to preserve what is this gem on earth.The newest Secret Lives of Seahorses exhibit is incredible and worth a trip across the country, in my opinion. If you have even the tiniest curiosity about these magnificent creatures, and what they do, how they do it and why they do it, go with an open mind and be prepared for your expectations to be blown out of the water.In harsh times, it's places like this that should remind us that there IS good going on in the world and these are places worth spending our hard earned dime (or unemployment check)!***We went the day before Christmas and it was very empty---a wonderful way to experience it. If you want to experience it this way, go close to holidays or on earlier-in-the-week weekdays."
3409,2010-06-07,4,"Fun place to visit, especially for hands-on exhibits.  Although I would have to say that the aquarium at the Academy of the Sciences in San Francisco is just as good, if not better.There's lots of little things to check out, including lots of hands-on stuff for kids.  There were a lot of electronic games scattered around the place, of questionable educational value, but I guess they're just there to keep the kids occupied.The worst part about this place is the parking situation.  I came later, a while after it had opened, so that probably wasn't the ideal time.  However I was lucky enough to get a spot in one of the parking lots, had an early lunch, and started checking out the aquarium while everyone else was heading out to lunch.  So the timing seemed to work out well for me.  It wasn't nearly as crowded as I remember it being, but then again I went on a Sunday on a normal weekend.Best parts:-jellyfish-seahorses-hands-on stuff-nice big viewing windows on the tanksWorst parts:-lots of people (and kids)-parking"
3410,2009-08-18,2,"This was a bittersweet experience. Well, mostly bitter. It truly is a world-class aquarium, certainly the best one in the US, but they let so many damn people in the place that it was the biggest disappointment of my entire trip. You have to be really patient (or really pushy) if you want to see even half of the exhibits up close.The jellyfish display is a must-see. Don't be afraid to throw a few elbows to get your money's worth."
3411,2012-02-20,5,"This was our fourth visit to the Aquarium and it continues to amaze us.  No matter how many times we go we are always able to appreciate something different and continue to learn more about the ocean creatures and conservation.  This time we took advantage of the unpublished feedings whereby you are texted several minutes before they begin.  We were able to see the puffins and common murres being fed, as well as the new otter pup.  The staff and volunteers are top notch and always so willing to answer anyquestions.  My husband asked a staff member a question and she admitted she didn't know but she got on her walkie-talkie and had the answer in a minute.  It is always so educational and fun.  My favorite exhibitsare the penguins, open see, the seahorses and the giant octopus.  We are amazed at how spotless the entire aquarium is - both the common areas and the exhibits themselves.  Alot of time and effort is put into keeping it clean.  This is the best aquarium we have been to and we look forward to our next visit."
3412,2014-04-07,1,"It's too expensive to see posters. There are not a lot of sea creatures, more of a presentation...tv, cardboard. You could see better watching it on planet earth! Don't waste your money and time. We've visited 3 times and I thought that they would get better but I was wrong! TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!"
3413,2007-07-11,5,"30 kinds of jellyfish but no dolphins.Anyhoo, come here if you are a fan of:1.  Otters2.  Jellyfish3.  Huge tuna that will scare the bejesus out of you"
3414,2010-07-06,5,"The Monterrey Bay Aquarium is a must see for kids of all ages. Kelp forests, jellyfish, seahorses, oh my! Wish I lived close enough to get an annual pass."
3415,2006-10-23,5,"I was just watching Nature on PBS today, and they were doing a special on Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA).  I have to say, it brought back so many memories and makes me want to back.  Coming from a poor, sheltered family, I didn't know stuff like this existed.  My opportunities to explore the world would come only during elementary school field trips. MBA is perhaps one of the reasons I pick the field of study that I did.  My first time at the ocean and I have to say, if I wasn't in awe then I was astonished.  I was one of those kids who listened to all the presenters with a tentative ear and touched everything that was allowed, (some not allowed as well.)  In fact, it is here at MBA that I learned that some toothpastes use sea kelp.I've been there twice since my first time there, and I am a kid again everytime.  Now, my goal...to go in with a camera for the first time.  An opportunity I never got to do.  Take your kids, your neighbor's kids, your inner kid because the world is getting smaller and this is one of the places that will make you stop in time to enjoy what beauty really is."
3416,2008-02-18,5,"Everything has been said about this place already. If you have never been here and your visiting the Monterey Area, this the best reason to even go to Monterey. (Unless you like wine tasting, overpriced hotels, snobby locals, even snobbier out of towners, expensive restaurants, shitty parking, cold weather, golf, golf pants, scenic drives, 6 dollar beers, or bird shit on your car.)If none of the above matches your description then head over to the Aquarium. It's a once in a lifetime experience. (Unless you have been there 23 times like me. Then it's a 23 times in a lifetime experience."
3417,2012-02-15,5,Great aquarium. Fun and informative exhibits. Volunteers and staff were nice and helpful.
3418,2008-01-21,5,Great underwater aquarium!  Entry fee for an adult is about $25.  I was most fascinated by their jellyfishies and their sea otters.  You walk outside and you see the view of the entire bay... so beautiful.
3419,2013-01-06,5,"The price of admission is a lot, however this place is spectacular. The jellyfish exhibits are truly aw inspiring. It's great for kids and there are a lot of them there. The giant sea turtles and enormous schools of fish were another favorite. A must see if you're in the area. Parking is questionable, we parked at the outlet mall lot which is about two blocks away from the water, opposite from Cannery Row."
3420,2012-06-28,5,"It's touristy, and it costs $10 to park blocks away, but do it anyway. You could spend a day here. We hurried (at a leisurely pace)  and we out in just under 3 hours. The sea otters are the top attraction.  The building is a great design with decks, and we had great views all the way to Santa Cruz.  The best Aquarium you're gona find."
3421,2007-01-03,5,"how can you NOT like this place?You can't really miss the aquarium even if you're in Monterey for only a short time. Kids will love it, and I acted like a big kid for the entire day there.me: look its NEMO!bf: its not nemo, its a clown fish!little boy: mommy, its NEMOOOOme: see, i told you it was nemo.my favorite things are the HUGE...actually ENORMOUS shark tank , NEMO, sea otters and the adorable penguins."
3422,2007-12-02,5,"Huge and fun! And WET! Love a fun day out, under the sea... Sure you have to stand in line to buy a ticket but then after that, you can spend hours exploring the otter show, watching waves (simulated and real), the sun (go outside and enjoy the view), the jellyfish (surreal), the penguins (hours of waddling), shows and trivia at the auditorium, the museum about the cannery... (deep breath)... shop at the shop... and so on! So much to see. Also, it's kind of like therapy. Human beings find water calming... apparently because it reminds us of our beginnings inside the womb."
3423,2008-12-15,5,"I went here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend. They offered free admission for Monterey County residents for a few weeks in December, so we decided to take advantage.Of course the place was overrun with young children and families, but we still had fun checking out the kelp forest, jellyfish, sharks, and sea otters. The text describing each exhibit was short and concise, which I liked. There were also lots of take-home pamphlets available. Bring your camera and I promise you'll get some great shots. Oh, and they have free WiFi."
3424,2009-11-03,5,"If you visit any aquarium this is the one you need to visit. Set right off John Steinbeck's Cannery Row is a magnificent palace of learning. It is also set in the beautiful city of Monterey also. One of their trademark exhibits is their kelp forest. It's just amazing.My favorites are the huge two story aquarium with gigantic fish swimming in it, the penguins, and the otters. I could watch those things all day! Call ahead to see when all the feeding times are, the diver talks while in the exhibit.It can get busy here, so I would go early. Parking is in one of the many structures in the area. There is plenty of places to shop and eat in the area as well."
3425,2012-06-27,5,"How can this place not get 5 stars? No matter how many times I visit I always find something new and fascinating here. Then again, I am a nature lover and I find ocean life mysterious and eerie! There are movies/presentations in the theatre and outdoor musical shorts for the kids. More stuff for the kids include the Splash Zone and the kelp farm. Yes, it can get crowded even on ""slow days"" during the middle of the week, especially during the summer. That is a sign that people are coming and coming for a reason. Come early to find parking in the nearby public pay lots. Check with the local hotels. Many of them sell a two day pass to anyone who will ask for the price of a one day pass."
3426,2006-09-07,5,"Guys, if you want to get lucky, do not, I repeat, DO NOT, bring your girl to the Monterey Bay Aquarium during a long weekend. The sight of all them crazy kids, high off salt-water taffy, swarming everywhere will scare the chastity belt onto any sane woman.  Consider yourself warned. Okay, the sardine tank is breathtaking.  And the otters are pretty damn adorable, all floating on their backs and stuff. But not nearly cute enough to risk fishing your own crazy rug rat out the bat ray touch pool in 40 weeks and 3 years."
3427,2007-01-02,4,"Four.  You heard me: Four.That's because I could Swear there were more jellyfish last time.  Also, while I was looking at the jellies, a young man of approximately FOUR years of age PUSHED ME aside to get a better look.  And the bat rays weren't into being petted this time.  Hell...3.75 stars."
3428,2009-07-12,4,"I love the aquarium. It allows an ocean-skittish person like me to get up close to sea life without being submerged. If you have never been (or even if you have) -- GO!......Just go on a weekday morning in the middle of winter to avoid the hordes of shrieking children. As an adult, I feel guilty if I try to get up close to the sea otter tank when there are children waiting, but those kids have no shame. They'll shove right past you and get snot all over the glass."
3429,2014-03-29,5,My husband and I came here a few years ago for a weekend get-away and spent the most wonderful day here. The exhibits are enchanting and there is more to see than you can fit into a day - almost. We came back a few weeks ago with our toddler and he loved it too!
3430,2007-08-21,4,"California's Best Aquarium.5 Stars.California's (and possibly the world's) most obnoxious children's attraction.- 500,000 stars.I'm completely with Sassy S. on this one.  This place is a nightmare.  The children scurry about like the vermin they are.  Now.  You might think that based on the current and previous reviews I've written, that I hate children.Not so.I just hate rackin'frackin' children who clamor up to me and jostle and push and crawl around me like I'm an obstacle in their way.  News alert: PARENTS - teach your kids some F'ing manners. CHILDREN - Contrary to what you may have learned in elementary school, the sea-fricking-otters are NOT going extinct in the next 5 minutes.  Wait your damn turn!To you kids with good manners, I'm sorry I lumped you in with this sweeping generalization, but it had to be done.  The many ruin it for the few.  My advice is to grow up.  Fast.  You can't get away with being a rude little varmint for much longer."
3431,2009-03-24,4,"This place is the bomb (like tick...tock).10 YEARS! It's been 10 years since I was last here. Aquariums are pretty exciting. It's nothing like walking through an art museum or any type of exhibit. It's huge, so don't forget your walking shoes. But if you're like me, Vans are good enough. My favorite parts were the shark exhibit, the jellyfish and the Manta Rays. HOH yea. But for some downsides: it was a Sunday. So obviously big crowds galore. Nonetheless, it was a sunny day and that added more to the fun.So if you can get past the excessive walking/ standing and the weekend rush, you'll be fine. For a place that's home to so much underwater wildlife, it's not so bad. Seriously, the aquarium kicks any museum in the face. WADDUP."
3432,2009-05-31,4,"This aquarium is a ""must see"" when visiting the Carmel/Monterey area. Unfortunately, it can be incredibly crowded at times, but overall the experience is enjoyable. I've been maybe 5 times in my life and still have a good time when I go. My advice is -if you can- go on weekdays. Weekends are the busiest and children have a way of crowding exhibits, rendering them nearly unobservable. The BF and I had the unfortunate luck of coming here last time on a radio station-sponsored Dora the Explorer day... we could barely see anything. I was tempted to hand out birth control pamphlets or condoms at all the exits, just in case these families weren't aware that 7 children is 5 too many. Oh, and your pregnant, too? Yeah... here's a brochure for -you-!"
3433,2011-10-25,4,Damn you sting rays for being fatty lil bitches.  I just want to pet your fatty asses.  These bastards are smart.  They just hang out on the other side of the tank so they can't be molested.  I've been coming to this aquarium since I was a kid. Tickets are at $30 a pop are expensive.
3434,2006-11-09,5,"What a fabulous day to spend with the kids and a great place to discover new things.  I think that as we get older we forget that the simple things in life are the most beautiful things.  There's something enchanting about a place like Monterey Bay Aquarium that I can't describe in words.  I only go here on the weekdays because coming here on the weekend is means for suicide hanging off the rafters, due to the crowd of families with their double and triple strollers with their 8 year old sitting on them! WTF.But when I do go during the week I have a pleasant experience. I think my most memorable moment was coming here with my boyfriend the weekend before my daughter was born.  I guess that three hour walk around the aquarium really got her excited to come out 2 and half weeks early."
3435,2007-11-01,5,"I love this place. Bodies of water and sea creatures have always fascinated me, although they freak me out a bit too. My sister is a member, so we go to this aquarium often. I took a couple of my friends here for the first time, and it's great to see how they react to the exhibits. They have a lot of members-only events here, which I haven't had the pleasure of attending. And coming here is a good excuse to eat at the Fish Hopper, and vice versa."
3436,2008-04-07,5,"This place is nothing short of amazing. Every time I come here I'm in complete awe of the exhibits they have.  There isn't much I can really say that hasn't already been said, but since some exhibits change from time to time I can talk about the new ones I've seen.The newest addition to the aquarium is ""Wild About Otters"" which is fantastic because I know very little about river otters.  The exhibit is new and fun.  Keep an eye out for the otters chasing each other back and forth in their ""river""The jellyfish exhibit is my absolute favorite. There are so many different kinds than just your basic sea nettle. I love how the aquarium contrasts art and glass sculptures to the grace of the jellyfish. Check out the mirrored room!The gift shop here is pretty great.  You can get some wonderful pieces of art or just a keychain.  They have some really cool prints of different sea life that are hand drawn. Every time I go I eye the turtle one, but I haven't bought it yet :(The price may be a little high, but you can spend all day here.  I suggest going in the morning during the week to avoid the zoo it becomes on the weekend.  My family has a membership and it allows us to just pop over there anytime we want.  I highly recommend getting one because the aquarium has special member days that are less crowded and not open to the public, and you hear about the new things they are doing before anyone else.Bottom line: This place is a beautiful and amazing learning experience."
3437,2009-05-27,5,"This place should bring out the child in everyone. This aquarium is head and shoulders above any other I've been to. Long Beach, Scripps and some others are nice but they have some unique and truly amazing exhibits here that blow the others away.I love the jellyfish. Every time I come here I wish I could have a tank in my house. So beautiful, one of the most amazing things you can see in an aquarium. They've added a seahorse exhibit that is almost as stunning. Add in the kelp gardens, sharks, penguins and otters and you've got nature gold.We went on Memorial Day weekend and it was a little too crowded, but on any other weekend it's a stunner. The museum itself is architecturally quite interesting too. The views from the decks are beautiful.Not to be mean but if you think this is a one star destination you are truly an idiot and have no love of nature and life and probably shouldn't be let out in public. I mean if you can't appreciate the sea dragons in all their delicate beauty, or the jellyfish and their hypnotic rhythms, or the penguins and their hilarious posturing, or the sharks and their stealthy stalking there's something seriously wrong with you."
3438,2009-11-28,4,"One of the best museums in the world. If you're visiting the area - this is a must see. They rotate their exhibits to keep it fresh too. I've been 4 times in my life.To sum it up:-it's huge, has a ton of diversity in creatures and things to see-the three otters and the otter feeding is a blast-the shark feeding is a sight to beholdKids and adults alike will like this place. I could definitely go back every few years."
3439,2006-02-26,5,"I was lucky enough to go to an evening event hosted here, and had an amazing time. Sadly, not all of the exhibits were open, but the jellyfish had me in raptures, and the huge plexiglas wall (it must be 20x30 feet) showcasing giant tuna, nurse sharks, and even a sunfish, possibly the weirdest and coolest fish ever, was awe-inspiring. We stood there for at least an hour. Undying gratitude to anyone who can figure out how I can have my own tank of light-up jellyfish."
3440,2007-06-19,4,"I am pretty easily entertained.  A goldfish in a bowl will do it for me.  An entire space dedicated to fish of all kinds, sharks, penguins, massive tuna and dorado (yum! haha), otters, marine birds, and jellyfish will REALLY do it for me.The highlight was definitely the jellyfish area.  I loved the lack of lighting in here - it made the jellies really stand out and look very alien and cool.  So mezmerizing.  I could watch them for hours.  Also, who knew sand dollars were living things?  Sa-weet.  Not too much action going on in that tank though.The sunfish is like a bad car accident.  You want to look away, but you really can't.  Seriously.  What IS that thing?  God, did you have a brain fart?"
3441,2007-09-05,4,"I love this aquarium!  Before today, I hadn't been here in almost 7 years.  I can definitely say that I enjoyed it more as an adult. We went up today to see the Wild About Otters Exhibit.  It was incredible.  I love Sea Otters, and this only confirmed my love for them.  We got to see the feeding and training session twice, and it was a ton of fun to watch.  the otters were adorable, and I learned that the otters were saved from the wild, most when the were abandoned as pups, and for health or behavioral reasons are not released back into the wild.  They also use these otters as surrogate mothers for other pups they save, which makes it easier to release them into the wild.I could have spent all day in the jelly fish exhibit... as the lady in front of us said, ""it's better than TV!""  We went through every room in the aquarium, and It was fascinating.We stayed here for a good 3-4 hours today.  The best time to go is during the week.  It's less crowded, and easier to see the different things."
3442,2010-01-05,5,"Actual conversation:Me: ""So I'm going to be visiting Monterey for a conference and the people running it suggest we check out this aquarium there. I dunno. Should I go? They didn't make it sound so exciting.""Roomie from Bay Area: ""If you are in Monterey and you do not visit the Aquarium *I will slap you across the face*.""Luckily for my face, I decided to check it out. Luckily for my mind, soul and sense of wonder, I was absolutely dazzled by what I saw! The facilities were spacious, clean, and well-maintained. All of the exhibits were outstanding, particularly the jellyfish and the current (as of this review) seahorse exhibition. The kelp forest is amazing, the otters are charming and I love that they have very kid-friendly ways of explaining sustainable seafood. These are the people who created the Seafood Watch guide!The conference people also arranged us to go on a ""behind the scenes tour"" which was informative about the Aquarium's history and led by a nice, funny woman but it could be skipped. Tours run about an hour long.As I was there on Christmas Eve it wasn't too crowded but I heard later that usually it's packed (like sardines, har har) with school groups. GO ANYWAY, WHATEVER AGE YOU ARE. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
3443,2010-02-17,5,"Can I say... I LOVE SECRET LIVES OF SEA HORSES! Amazing... the entire exhibition is purely amazing. Over time the aquarium really hasn't changed much. I love the fact that every time I go here I can find new creatures within the tanks; however they are always located in the same area. My cousin spent like an hour at the bat ray touch tank... it was really funny. The price is kinda outrageous. For a family of four it can cost upwards of $110.00. If you live in the area and have small children, it is almost stupid not to get a membership for $250.00."
3444,2010-03-19,4,"Amazing aquarium. So much to see. Seahorse exhibit fantastic. Staff nice and knowledgeable. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars in my book is it's EXPENSIVE to get in. I think they could definitely cut back on their prices a bit.Also, the food in the cafeteria was a bit disappointing... aren't aquariums supposed to have clam chowder as an option by rule??"
3445,2009-02-11,5,"I heart this place. It is always fun, a little crowed depending on the day. Always doing something new. I like the free local days. They are mostly in December for a week. The new splash zone that opened back up last year is really neat with all the touching pools. you can never go wrong with the aquarium."
3446,2009-08-04,5,"this is one of my favorite places on earth!i grew up going to monterey bay aquarium at least once a year.  I've been to my fair share of aquariums but NOTHING tops monterey bay.  I'm always the nerdy one that goes ""OoOo did you see that fish? ...o wait look over there!!""  i can literally spend everyday for a whole week in this place and not get tired of it.  It's not only HUGE but it's got TONS of stuff that other aquariums don't have.  hello! THEY HAVE OTTERS!!! and if that doesn't make you want to get in your car right now and drive over there, i don't know what will!? monterey bay aquarium is up there with the 7 wonders of the world...definitely a must see/experience before you die."
3447,2011-10-31,5,"Who doesn't love aquariums?!Informative, educational, relaxing and fun, Monterey Bay Aquarium really is mother nature's work of art gifted for us to enjoy. I'd come here again and again. You leave feeling in awe of the creatures that live around us, and you can spend hours here! Fit for ages of all types, for all kinds of people, and you definitely gain more than you pay for. The only downside is that you won't want to come when there are field trips by schools here, but it's understandable why there may be! This place is affordable, and you really won't have enough time to enjoy every exhibit because, like I said before, you can spend hours here!Love it! :D"
3448,2009-06-23,3,"A trip to the aquarium reaffirmed several things for me:1. I am not ready for children. Not ready to batter my way through throngs of people, young and old, just so that Junior can get a better look at the giant plastic model of plankton. Not ready to navigate 5,000 other children while Junior, in his stroller, hollers his tonsils onto the floor of the octopus exhibit, with a look on my face that says he'll have to reach at least 140 decibels before I'm fazed.2. I like furry animals. Though I realize each scaly, cold blooded, crusty, little guy is equally important to our ecosystem, I could breeze on by unless it learns to clean its fur in a cute way and rap its frozen fish on the viewing window. Awwww!!3. Expensive tickets start me out on a bad foot. There was going to have to be some serious otter action in order for me to find paying $30/person worth my while. The jellyfish and penguins almost did it for me...but not quite."
3449,2011-10-12,4,"Pretty cool aquarium. Granted, I'm partial to the ones on the East Coast but this one is kind of amazing. The exhibits are very well separated and each different area has a very unique look. I absolutely loved the sting ray pool (especially when one of them appeared to wait until the woman next to me had her head turned before DRENCHING HER and swimming away quickly). My friends and I were here on the cheap for a GF getaway and the student IDs definitely came in handy. The bus stop is right by the aquarium and you cannot miss the building. Fun, informative, and a great place to take some awesome pictures."
3450,2006-06-05,5,"Pure Bliss. D'ya think dying here increases your chances of being reincarnated as an otter?If so, I'm jumping into the outer bay exhibit with rocks in my pocket."
3451,2008-12-29,4,"Holy starfish I didn't review this yet!?  I went here a few months ago and was so excited because I LOOOOOVE ocean animals.  My expectations were high so I was kinda disappointed at how many people there were on a tuesday.  I was expecting a few tourists here and there but it seemed like it was a huge daycare center with animals in the background.  I hardly had the chance to see my favorite exhibits because of the many kids that kicked my shins to see the starfish and jellyfish.  But I guess since I'm 26 years old, I had to stand in the background and just tippy toe from behind everyone to try and get a glimpse of an eel's tail.  But hey!  It wasn't really fair that I couldn't just jump to the front of the line in each window!  The exhibits I did closely see were amazing.  I loved the jellyfish and the huge aquarium with all the sharks.  That was the highlight of the day.  It's a really small aquarium.  I really thought it would be larger.  I was looking for the penguins but they were MIA.  The otter exhibit was cool looking at from a few meters away.  It was bombarded by families and photographers from Australia.  I did see the otter swim though.Another exhibit that was awesome was the kelp forest!  That was such a beautiful site.  You wouldn't think plants on top of the ocean would extend down below to such beauty.  Overall, the experience was great.  I had a great time there.  Unfortunately, I couldn't see everything I wanted to see because of the many people that were there.  I would recommend getting a two day pass that usually comes with hotel accommodations at good prices.  If you have children, they will run around and say ""look mommy! look!""  So for the parents, just hold on to them and let the 26 year old Filipino girl go see the jellyfish exhibit first!"
3452,2013-08-13,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a beautiful facility. The entry charge of $35 for adults and $22 for children might seem steep but you need to consider what it takes to keep a place like this running. Not only are many of the tanks huge, there's a vast array of sea life on display and those tank pumps and filters are running 24/7. But if you look closer, and pay attention to the actual DETAIL they put into their exhibits, you can't help but be impressed. I'm not talking about what you see in the tanks per se, I'm talking about room dividers, signs, information cards, props etc. A tremendous amount of work goes into each exhibit even though you might not really be aware of it because it's been done so seamlessly. The aquarium has also been designed not only as a place to enjoy the beauty and the mystique of the ocean, but it's been designed to be an education center. Daily shows, feedings and the touch pools are all great examples. So give yourself several hours to take it all in. It's not all butterflies and rainbows though. The aquarium can get insanely crowded where there are not only lines to get into the aquarium itself, but lines to get into the bathrooms, gift shops and cafe as well. As you might imagine, these crowds can make enjoying the exhibits and the entire experience difficult. My advice? Avoid the weekends, come early and if at all possible, avoid the summer crowds."
3453,2011-10-24,5,"Great fun for the whole family at a very affordable price!  The money goes to helping the animals in the aquarium and I loved that they are very helpful in preserving our wildlife.  They even give out cards which tell you the best fish to eat.  The animals are amazing.  It's educational and fun and very, very well done."
3454,2009-04-05,2,"My boyfriend and I love going to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, but we somehow got the impression that the Monterey Bay was above and beyond amazing. So today, on our way back to LA from SF, we took CA-1 to Monterey and went in. We didn't want to pay 10 dollars for parking in a lot so we pumped $3.00 in quarters into a meter, and set an alarm to come back before the 2 hours were up (25c/10minutes!)We thought we would have to move the car and come back to see the rest of the aquarium, but we managed to see everything in under an hour. There weren't very many exhibits, compared to all the rooms they have at the Aquarium of the Pacific, though I did very much enjoy the otters. The view was also pretty amazing. However, for the price (and the hype), I was expecting better."
3455,2010-07-10,5,"An absolute must-see in Monterey - in fact, if you are looking for a trip idea - Go To Monterey! Just for the aquarium. This is one of the top aquariums in the world. Built right into Monterey Bay, you will not find another aquarium of this caliber.I love the sea horse exhibit - it was truly amazing. The kelp forest and the diver was magical. The feeding of the penguins was so much fun. The sea otters provide endless entertainment!You must go here!"
3456,2012-01-19,5,LOVE this place! I go all the time thanks to membership passes! always something interesting to see! I am a little bummed that the flamingo exhibit is gone but I am hoping that only means that something better is coming
3457,2014-10-25,5,"Amazing family friendly attraction. This is a review on behalf of my husband who brought our 1 and 8 year old while I was doing work in Monterey. All 3 of them had an absolute blast, and the spouse was especially impressed with how many things there were for the kids. Sounds like it just gets better every time we come here!"
3458,2012-07-08,4,"Not going to lie, this was a great aquarium, but it gets only 4 stars due to too-high expectations, I guess. This place is consistently ranked the #1 aquarium in the US, so I was expecting it to surpass Shedd. But it didn't. But that's not a bad thing either, because Shedd is so ridiculously amazeballs. You can pet things, which I always love in an aquarium. The reason I live is basically to watch penguins, and the penguin exhibit was kind of so-so (although there was this amazing moment where two of them were totally getting it on and all the other penguins were sitting around watching). The jelly exhibit was really great, as was 'The Secret Lives of Seahorses'. All around great aquarium, just not the best in the country."
3459,2012-08-08,2,"I live in Cincinnati and we have a better aquarium than this...the only thing better in Monterey is that they have the ocean overlook - but that isn't really a big part of the aquarium and you can get that a lot of places. We spent $150 for 5 of us and got thru the whole thing in 2 hours. I would say the best part was the kids' play area, but it was totally not worth my money, other than it's for a good cause in general. Don't spend your time driving here, but it might be fun if you're in Monterey with nothing else to do."
3460,2012-09-11,5,"I was here again a couple weeks ago and we got a special after-hours tour by security. It was SO COOL. The security guards there are dual-trained as security and tour guides. Our tour included some regularly off-limits places to the public, and a lot of insight into the animals that live there. Thanks to our tour guide, I now want an octopus as a pet! :)  It was really great."
3461,2012-05-08,4,"I love their SEA HORSES!!!! The place is pretty big and clean, It was a bit hard to take pictures because it's quite dark inside. The rest rooms are clean and well maintained.  Staffs are friendly. The entrance ticket is a bit pricey though and no food/drinks allowed inside when their cafeteria only serves very limited on drinks and food."
3462,2012-07-02,5,"I love the aquarium!! It never cease to disappoint me everytime I go. I've gone ever since I was in elementary school to now as a college student.  The aquarium updates certain exhibits as well as having limited time ones. My favorite is the jellyfish room, the room is huge and all lit with the color blue. The workers are very knowledgeable about the fish and sea creatures. It's a great place for children, the area is called splash zone. It gives the kids and adults too, a place to be hands on and have fun. Even babies are welcomed. The view outside is amazing, overlooking the ocean with random sea lions laying out on the rocks. Great pictures to take!"
3463,2010-08-05,5,"I come to this aquarium at least twice a year. The fact is that there is only one major competitor to this fabulous place and that's the newly redesigned San Francisco California Academy of Sciences. However I love the fact that this place is dedicated to ocean life and CAS has other animals. But for someone like me, whose been a huge fan, I will one day bring my children here. I always watch the sea otter shows and kelp feeding. And though I've seen both numerous times, I never tire of learning more about the oceans and its creatures. My profound respect for the ocean is something I hope to teach my children one day. Proof that I'm addict, I use their otter cams as my desktop video wallpaper when my computer is idle."
3464,2012-10-17,5,Awesome Place to take the kids and to go on a date. Loved every minute of it.
3465,2013-02-04,3,It's really nice in here but the price is too high imo especially for large groups.
3466,2012-10-14,5,"Awesome!  Almost a four though 'cause they can be a bit preachy.  I like the science and appreciate the conservation efforts but it's a fine line to walk without becoming all ""Greenpeacey"".  They seem to do an OK job at it though...."
3467,2014-10-11,4,this place is awesome. wish it was less crowded & didn't cost so much. they need to have deals/coupons. Have been here twice & will go back. they have plenty of things to see & do for kids.
3468,2012-01-02,3,"God, I hate children.  Parking sucks.  Sea otters are super cute though.  The sun fish is dead.  : ("
3469,2010-05-16,5,"Simply amazing experience. The facility is quite large and has a many exhibits featuring creatures of the ocean. We were are able to see the penguins and sea otter feedings which was entertaining and very educational. It was also a great experience in that we were able to see wild otters and seals outside the aquarium in the ocean from the observation decks. While the price of $30 may seem high, it is definitely worth it and the money goes to a great cause.Also, while we did not take any kids we did see that there were many sections of the aquarium that were very kid friendly and seem to captivate the kids that were in those sections."
3470,2011-11-20,4,The aquarium is clean and there are many things for children to enjoy. We went on Veterans Day and it was too busy. Normally the aquarium is too expensive but veterans were free today.
3471,2007-09-13,5,Olivia loved this place ... kid friendly and new attractions since I last came.  Seems like more types of animals to touch.  And the jelly fish attraction was cool.   Sea otters too.
3472,2008-04-03,4,"Took my 4 yr old nephew there and he loved it. It was spring break and crowded yet we were still able to see whatever we wanted to see (cept the giant octo, which wasn't  hardly doing much to garner five layer deep attention). The jellyfish are the sh*ts. I think I sort of had my way with a starfish (fingered it, that is) but it was an accident."
3473,2008-05-13,4,"Best aquarium on the west coast.  We saw a baby otter in the outdoor bay exhibit.  If the place wasn't so darn crowded, it'd be better.  I love the fact they have a mola mola aka sunfish there that cruises around the big tank.  Great place for kids and adults alike.  Highly recommend."
3474,2008-08-27,5,How could you NOT love this place?
3475,2008-09-03,4,"This was a great Aquarium.  If you have kids, your kids will have a great time! I thought the Aquarium would be a lot bigger, but it was great to spend a day here!"
3476,2008-12-23,4,"Tickets are now up to $25, but it's still a gorgeous venue.  Helpful staff, too.  They're opening a big seahorse exhibit in April and we'll definitely return to see how that looks.  No line when we went this weekend, but lines can be a huge pain to buy tickets in the summer."
3477,2009-04-10,5,World Class.   I've been to aquariums all over planet earth.  This one is superlative.
3478,2009-11-26,4,"I love this place! The exhibits are great and the space itself can be quite relaxing. I just wish I could remember to come on a weekday during the school year. The difference in noise levels on a holiday or during the summer and during a quiet Wednesday are vast. So, if you don't want to enjoy the exhibits without the crowd in front of the tank being three or four deep. that's my advice. Hopefully you'll pick a time when the otters feel playful and the penguins are inclined to mug for the throng. Do touch the starfish and try to catch a glimpse of the new shark."
3479,2010-03-19,4,Quality: 5Value: 4Definitely worth a visit. There are so many exhibits and animals. Minus one star for always being so packed.
3480,2011-11-19,5,"I'm not adding anything new that other reviews haven't said already.  This place is pretty awesome, but I wished we had went on a weekday so there could have been less people.  We had to wait to closely see each exhibit, and we didn't get to stay too long because there were usually people waiting next to us.  The touch area was pretty amusing.  I was able to stick my hands in and feel several creatures, my absolute favorite being the sea cucumber.  The lady advised us to stroke it gently with two fingers.  I felt like I was petting it.  :D  I was bad and tried to pull a sea star up, but that thing was holding on pretty tight!  The husband thought the sea otters were the most amusing and cute.  We saw the penguin feeding show and also the albatross, was it?  I can't remember.  The presentations were very well done, although obviously aimed at children.  We also viewed a couple of presentations at the ""otter-torium""!  Muahahaha. Get it??!!  =P  We saw presentations on sea otters, inventions inspired by sea creatures, jellyfish, sharks, in that order.  They were only 15 minutes each, and the presenters were so dynamic and interactive.  A++ there!  It was also interesting to learn the history behind the infamous Cannery Row.  For some strange reason, I thought it was named after the bird, but nope, actual canning of fish.   Great experience, great people, and I really appreciated that there were so many dedicated volunteers.  I love the awareness they try to bring, and the reminders of conservation.  Initially, admission at $30 per person seems pretty steep, but considering that this is a  non-profit organization, I think it's completely fine!  :)"
3481,2012-07-03,5,As always - this aquarium is awesome.  We came a few years ago and really enjoyed it.  Paid quite a bit for tickets but our local aquarium is about the same price and you only spend an hour or so looking at everything - we spent all day and still didnt spend enough time.  Kids loved it.  Went in winter last time and wasnt very busy - it is quite hectic in the summer - even on a weekday.
3482,2011-08-11,4,Place is real fascinating.  Not an easy task though on a Saturday.  Best days to go are Monday through Thursday.  I can't tell you how many sticky children I wanted to toss into the shark tank.  Cheers
3483,2006-12-06,5,"You can't go wrong with this place.We were lucky enough to go when that Great White was there.  What an experience all by itself.  Also, outside of the really cool jellyfish exhibit was a display of Chihuly glass.  What an experience all by itself.The exhibits full of kelp and otters that actually move with the tides.  What an experience all by itself.Do you get my drift?  It's great.  I recommend going in the offseason (not during the summer) and going in the morning on Sat or Sun.  If you can get away with going during the week, even better.  The parking is all pay down there, and the parking people are everywhere.  Just spend the $$ and go to a pay lot.  Feeding the meter will get you burned."
3484,2007-10-12,3,"Because one part of the aquarium is closed until next March, there seemed to not have enough to look, though the jelly fish is definitely mesmerizing. I was also hoping to find whales and dolphins but did not at the bay. Driving for more than 2 hours I was really expecting more..."
3485,2008-06-10,5,This place is awesome!!!!!!!!The jellies in my profile picture were photographed on my camera phone here!!!!Also I the fish tank is freaking cool....Who can say no to two hammerhead sharks swimming around and frightening all of the other fish in the tank? It is so entertaining to watch everything scatter every couple minutes in fear of these beasts.One of my favorite moments was standing at the penguin tank and watching those birds just start attacking the glass trying to get at a kid who was wearing a glow in the dark skeleton shirt. Anyone remember that polar bear video of the girl wearing the seal hat? It was like that but with ten penguins trying in earnest to get a five year old........classicDon't miss the petting tanks either. Great fun to be had playing with starfish and sea urchins....
3486,2008-07-15,5,"There were so many amazing things to see at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. They had multiple varieties of otters. One otter section is kinda hidden, so watch out for it.The coolest thing about this aquarium is its large scale. I had never seen large schools of fish swimming by before. They reflected bright, silver light in beautiful and captivating ways. The gigantic sun fish is a must see. It is unbelievably large and floats along so peacefully."
3487,2008-09-16,4,"Great place for first timers! You can spend a good amount of time exploring the two huge separate sides of the aquarium although you'll probably spend more time on the left side which has plenty of fish and large tanks. I always love their visual exhibits, easy to read info and knowledgeable people walking around explaining exhibits. Simply put, a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium is just a simple, educational, and chill experience for anyone.Make sure you check the feeding times for the larger tanks, especially the otters since they are more playful and active to watch. People that work here go out of their way to make the experience and knowledge shared during feeding time, both fun and entertaining. The touching pool is pretty neat if you haven't been to one before although getting a chance to touch the rays is pretty hard since they tend to stay in the far corner.Price might be a bit more expensive compared to other aquariums but it's well worth the admission to check out their extensive displays, especially the jellyfish display which seems to be going away real soon. Only con I can really think about for this place is that once you've seen everything once, there's really no reason to drop by again for another 3-4 years since the displays are relatively persistent.Spent around 3-4 hours to fully explore the museum. Make sure you grab a fish card!"
3488,2009-05-28,5,"I must say that this is a place I can return to over and over again. Unlike a regular museum the life that moves around in this aquarium is breathtaking! Our most recent visit was on a foggy Saturday afternoon during memorial day weekend, it was packed with kids!! The crowds were a little hard to deal with but what was worse were the visitors (and there were many) who took pictures with a flash over and over again!! Now it is the fault of the visitor for not observing the signs but also a big fault to the staff who did not prevent the constant flutter of flashes. We had bought our ticket through our hotel and for $29 each we were permitted to return the next day if we wished, a special deal they do for the hotels. A little pricey for a couple of hours but the $$ goes to the fish! I loved the jellyfish and seahorse exhibits, they were amazing! It is also really nice to grab a drink and sit out on the plentiful decks and watch the ocean, a nice getaway when the kids are running around inside."
3489,2009-11-07,5,"I absolutely love all aquariums, how can you not?!One of the best part of Monterey Bay's is the HUGE aquarium wall (Kelp Forest?) that is at least 4 times your height. They even have pseudo bleacher/stadium seating because you could really sit there for a while and see a million different things. Including some glimpses of large and stunning sharks!This aquarium is huge. Lots of different exhibits to visit and ground to cover. I really liked the penguin habitat and the special otter one. You can even walk outside on an upper deck and look out at Monterey Bay and see the seals. This whole property is just really well done - don't live life without having been here!"
3490,2007-10-11,4,"I have visited this place three times so far, and I fall in love with it every time. Its well worth the journey from San Mateo.The shark tank is my favorite, how many people in the world really get to see wildlife like that up so close. Ad that flat shark thing in the tank...what is that???!!! All in all a great spot to choose when visiting Monterey for the day. i can't wait to go back to see the new otter exhibit. Those animals are just too cute!!!"
3491,2008-04-15,5,"This was an awesome place to visit.  We spent a week in San Jose, CA during the summer of 2006 and this was one of the many places we went.  I had a great time just sitting and watching the otters play with each other.  Their exhibits are extraordinary.  Only downside: SO MANY screaming kids.  If I had the opportunity to go back, I'd go on a weekday to enjoy the place a little better."
3492,2009-05-03,5,"Wow!  I was really impressed with this place!  All except for the price of admission...I guess there are special, time-limited exhibits and the one they had while we were here was the seahorses.  Amazing display and variety.  They came out well in pictures, too!There are so many things to see here, with so much information on plaques along the walls.  I could have spent hours here, but we were on a time budget so we cruised through the exhibits and finished in just under 2 hours.  Unfortunately, as we were walking up to get our tickets, I saw about 4 huge school busses pull up.  I thought the place was going to be crowded with unruly kids--and I was right.  But there are so many interactive things and toys and stuff for the kids, it kept many of them away from the actual exhibits.  Very savvy, Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
3493,2009-11-09,4,"Kelp forest feeding was definitely educating :) the diver was so cool! it was definitely great for kids too since you may ask questions as the diver answers while hes in the water feeding fishes!My favorite exhibit was The Secret Lives of Seahorses, who knew that Male can give birth! only in the seahorse family!The Outer Bay exhibit was also veryy cool. It was crowded with lots of kids! I was pretty amazed.If you bring kids, definitely stop by the touching exhibits too so they can get a feel of starfish and clams!I love Monterey Bay Aquarium, afterwards, you may also enjoy some really delicious clam chowder in breadbowl on the stores nearby. :)Definitely will come again! (since they're opening a Flamingo exhibit in 2010)"
3494,2014-10-26,5,"Love love love the aquarium. It's definitely over priced, but I'm sure the upkeep to keep it as clean and pretty as it is gets expensive. They definitely have a lot to learn here, but you need to take the time to read, not just gander over the pretty sights. Our little girl loved it!!"
3495,2012-04-17,5,We love it here!! A must see! Kids will love it.... Get the schedule ahead of time and see the feedings....
3496,2007-03-19,4,"A definite fun place to explore. It may be boring for some people but for those nerds and curious ppl out there this is the place for them. I went here several times for a bio project and just family outing. At times it can get mundane but thats ok, because then I just start wondering off on my own. There are many things to go ohh and ahh at. If you're ired of looking at things you can go poke & touch at critters such as sea slugs, sting rays and etc. Go here and just let your imagination take over."
3497,2008-04-27,5,"The Jelly Fish Section is my favorite part of the museum!!! They are so pretty to look at!! In addition, there are some crazy looking jelly fish, such as the ones with the blue dots on their tentacles and the egg yolk jelly fish. The upside down jelly fish were funny to watch since they are always pushing against the ground.The aquarium is very kid friendly. Splash Zone is definitely aimed at for kids. There are lots of bright colors and kids can interact with the sea creatures. Tip- buy your tickets ahead of time!!! There was a long line just to buy tickets. Luckily we had a season pass, so there was a special admission line."
3498,2008-08-13,4,"This is a place I loved as a kid, and I'm pretty sure I'll love again when I have kids.It's exciting and informative and there are plenty of opportunities for exploration.  But the tourists get to me...  And honestly, you see it once, you've seen it enough for a few years..  This is a great place, but I don't think I'll be back until I have kids of my own to enjoy it!"
3499,2009-03-18,5,"The best aquarium EVER.I don't know what else to say.The tide pools are excellent. I love the fact that you can touch things here. They have a touching table. You get to feel all sorts of ocean creatures: sea spider, starfish, sea cucumber, etc.Then they have the ray pool. You stick your hand in a little tiled pool and stingrays go flying through the water and you can feel them. When I was a kid, this was the greatest!Not only that, but the food here is actually good. So you don't have to leave the place to take a break and have something to eat.I really don't know of a better aquarium that offers as much.Dolphin/whale shows would be interesting (like at Shedd Aquarium)."
3500,2010-02-18,5,"The best word to describe MBA is ""mesmerizing.""  I could easily spend an hour in front of each tank, just watching.  The exhibits here are so beautiful that you soon realize that you are watching living art.  If you are expecting lots of action, you will probably be disappointed...this ain't SeaWorld!Of course, the one thing that might interfere with your appreciation of the exhibits are the HOARDS of people jostling for a good viewing spot.  If you have a low tolerance for crowds, make sure and visit during a low-traffic time.  We took lots of breaks on the many outdoor patios to escape the chaos, breathe in some fresh air, and admire the views.  Even so, by five o'clock I was ready to choke the life out of somebody if one more person pushed me.My favorites this time were the jellyfish and the seahorse exhibit.  Toddler really enjoyed Splash Zone (by the way, if you are visiting without children, I would recommend that you steer very clear of that nightmare of stressed parents and screeching children).  Sadly, the bat rays were all cowering in the corner by the time we got to them, so we didn't get to pet them, which was my favorite part of previous visits.In short, while there are some serious problems with crowd control, I don't have the heart to dock them a star for it because I love this place SO much!"
3501,2012-10-19,5,"AG and I were stuck in major traffic and did not arrive until 4pm Saturday evening.We got the best surprise of our vacation -it was a nightlife hours at Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was filled with live jazz band and option to purchase healthy affordable food from the cafeteria. We even got to watch and listen to shark experts who track these majestic mammals with satellite technology in a special viewing exhibit.And after all this time, I still heart the jellies and the two story glass displays of the underwater sea life. It is collected Zen moments."
3502,2012-07-21,5,"A great place, and perhaps the best aquarium I have been to (and I have been to MANY).  From the amazing sea otters to the psychadelic jellyfish exhibit--everything was marvelously laid out.  It was all extremely interactive.  Try to beat the crowds, by lunchtime it was pretty crowded with school groups, even on a weekday.  Very helpful staff and volunteers throughout, overall an easy 5 of 5, and a must visit if you are in the area."
3503,2007-04-05,3,"Christ, what a zoo!  The fish have it lucky.  I'm sure there's some significant difference between this place and the Aquarium of the Pacific (yelp.com/biz/4TOmdzSJ9R8…) that the curators are fiercely proud of and defensive about, but I wasn't able to discern it as a lay visitor.  If you love a madhouse of people and seafood - here you go.  3 stars."
3504,2007-06-25,3,"Maybe I'm just rusty with aquariums, but I found this one underwhelming. I was pretty excited to go. I think I knew about the aquarium before I knew where Monterey was. I grew up in Boston which is pretty attached to its aquarium (even though it has gone downhill lately). Anyway, I was a little blown away by the entrance fee, but I figured for an aquarium of its reputation it would be worthwhile.Well, the jellyfish were absolutely stunning. I got a million fabulous pictures. I also enjoyed the large tank with a variety of fish. The aquarium did have some innovative exhibits which highlighted nature's influence on art. I think this is a great place for kids of which there were seemingly thousands. However, I didn't feel like I got my money's worth here. Maybe it was just the hordes of people on a Sunday afternoon, but I expected something more. Be careful when you sign up for any 15 minute shows. I thought that we would see otters up close and it turned out to be a game show format for kids. I guess that was my own stupidity.Anyway, adults looking to learn more about marine wildlife might be a little disappointed."
3505,2007-12-27,5,"This place is incredible.  I could spend all day just watching the otters in the new otter exhibit.  Or the amazing jellyfish.  Or the feeding in the kelp forest.  Or the huge expanse of the outer tank.  Damn, it's a good thing I arrived early.Someone else suggested an adults-only day and I will second that.  The only drawback to this place is the craziness of all the screaming kiddies running wild.  Sensory overload!  If I lived closer, I'd just buy a membership and go more often for less time rather than trying to take it all in at once.  It's sorta like The Louvre that way."
3506,2008-03-17,5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Well done MBA - I almost was scared off by the admission prices - cost over $80 for a family of four including a child under 4! but we are soooo glad we did it. The feel, the lay out, the volunteers, the cafe (which although busy was really reasonable and quick!) - waterside seating watching the waves crash in and enjoying a cold beer midway through our visit was great. All the interactive displays actually worked which was a welcome change. Our kids loved the hands on exhibits.Highly recommend."
3507,2008-03-27,5,"I love otters.  I am thrilled to watch otters being fed.  I adore seeing the joy on my nephew's face as he watches sharks cruising for their food.  The ideal destination for these pleasures?  The Monterey Aquarium.How great is this place?! It has lots of great-looking educational and fun exhibits, right on the bay.  Several Touch Pool areas, where kids (and adults) can touch starfish, spiny urchins, sea slugs and sea cucumbers.  There's a glass-roofed area where waves crash right over your head.  Huge tanks that display different ocean habitats: a kelp forest, the outer sea, wharves, the sea floor.  There's also a whole gallery devoted to jellies, which became my new favorite.  I now desire a salt-water tank in which jellies ethereally pulse and float - a natural alternative to the lava lamp."
3508,2008-05-02,5,"I've been going to this aquarium for years,  in fact, the first time I ever gone here was when I was in grade school. I just paid this place a visit in October of 2007 and I enjoyed it just as much as every other time I visited it. I actually enjoyed it more because i was able to share this experience with my girlfriend. Plus now that I'm older, I have much more appreciation for the work that gets put into taking care of the marine animals. Consequently a couple days after there was an 2 hour special on Animal Planet about this aquarium. It's one of the best of it's kind in the country because of the wide variety of species and researchers that study here. It's really educational and it would be an excellent thing to do with the family."
3509,2009-02-18,4,"Totally worth a visit if you're in the Bay Area. It's not the Biggest nor the Greatest, but it's a good-size, laid-back aquarium right by the Pacific Ocean. I love the jellyfish, sea kelp and sea otter exhibitsBeautiful scenery....esp when yo look out in the ocean and see the sea ottersGorgeous!"
3510,2009-11-09,4,"I think other Yelpers have done a nice job of pointing out all the good things about this attraction. I'll add my own two cents here by saying the price is pretty overwhelming, which makes it a tough destination to visit for a regular middle-class family. Really, there should be a discount for CA residents, or something to that effect ($3 from AAA ain't exactly a massive discount!).I'm lucky enough to have been able to afford to bring visiting guests here recently. $25 per person puts this place in a pretty elitist category, in my opinion. Many families would have to save quite a while to afford that and, if they had the cash, would likely take their kids to Great America since it allows them an all-day experience that lets them get a bit of energy out. Yes, the money goes towards a good cause, but try explaining that to a single parent who is watching every dime.  Beautiful place if you have the cash."
3511,2010-06-10,5,"I have never been to a more amazing aquarium than this. My jaw was on the floor the entire time. I felt like a child in a candy store.There is nothing in this aquarium that was boring. Every is amazing! There is a huge tank known as the Kelp Forest where they do feedings several times a day.This aquarium has also housed two Great White Sharks. Both have been released back into the ocean. I wish I was able to see the the Great White Sharks.Giant octopus, sea otters, sea horses, hammer head sharks, and ocean sunfish! This place is amazing. I highly recommend it!!"
3512,2010-05-06,5,"This place rocks! We came here for a Kaiser Physicians Group Dinner and it was an amazing experience. After hours and closed to the public, you can have a party here; weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, whatever your desire, if you're willing to pay! They had tables set up all over the aquarium and various food stations. I'm not sure who catered the event but the food was just alright, its not easy to serve 1000 people. The experience was definitey worthwhile! We loved the sauteed wild mushroom station set up in front of the jellyfish tank and eating under swimming great white sharks was just amazing! The aquarium is awesome, one of the best. We are season pass holders for the Academy of Sciences in SF but wish we lived closer to this place because it is so much better!! Our kids did not want to leave the kids splash areas! I just love looking at the jellyfish and the seahorse exhibits!"
3513,2012-06-08,4,"Although it does not compare with some of the bigger aquariums in the country (Atlanta springs to mind) in terms of size or species, this aquarium is very special in its own way. Everything is presented in an integrated fashion that makes you feel as if you did dive into the bay and had a tour of the sea-life there. The sea otters are a great exhibit, you can take a close look at them in the aquarium and then step out on their observation deck and watch them in the wild. Finally, I don't have kids, but it did look like an AWESOME place for little humans of all ages."
3514,2010-05-03,5,"We were incredibly fortunate to win tickets to the aquarium and brought 3 youngsters with us.  It is even better than a remembered.  Despite the rain, it was quite crowded with families and tour groups.  They have a bunch of new exhibits that are interactive and kept the attention of the elementary-aged youngin' we were with.  It's manageable to complete the visit within 5 hours, especially since we got a slightly earlier start.  The seahorse exhibit was amazing, the otters incredibly cute and the penguin feeding was fun.As for the food, I'm glad someone else liked the clam chowder because I was really looking forward to some, but it was chunky, lukewarm and unappealing.  The burgers were mediocre, but the fries were a large serving.  Overpriced food, but I figure the proceeds go to the aquarium.  The line was a bit long and tables scarce; I'd hate to see what it was like on a crowded day. I hovered for a table and squatted for a bit while they got their food because I did not want to have to deal with three kids trying to find a place to sit.  The nice thing was it was a window seat - right next to the ocean (which is the same view if we ate at their ""full-service"" cafe)."
3515,2011-08-09,3,"Well, for ocean aficionados and tree huggers, this place is Nirvana.  For the rest of us, it is a cool fishbowl and tourist trap.  Cost $29 bucks for online ticket.  Do this ahead, and avoid a stand in line to purchase it here.  Next, it will cost you $15 bucks to park near the place.  Ya gotta pay the piper so just roll with it.  Many consider this the best aquarium in the world, but I was not so impressed.  On the weekend, this place must be a sea of humanity.  We came on a Summer Tues, and it was still quite crowded.  2 hours should about do it, fighting your way thru getting up close to the exhibits.  Avoid the gift shops as $20 bucks is the minimum damage.  Hey, if you are in the area, check it out, and feel good that your patronage went toward saving the  ocean.  They never let ya forget that here!"
3516,2012-06-03,3,"Only the 2nd aquarium i'm ever been to.  Compared to Vancouver, I though this one was just ok.  Tons of kids (as you'd expect) and kinda small."
3517,2012-06-03,5,"I had a really awesome weekend here not too long ago.  There's so many things to do in the area and the coastline is just beautiful.  The variety of inhabitants of this aquarium is really wonderful.  This place is perfect for family trips, dates, field trips, and for oceanic geeks.  I will definitely be back again someday."
3518,2014-12-06,5,We come here at least twice a year. My kids love everything about this place. As for people  complaining about the steep price. I believe the aquarium is a not for profit so you should be able to make your ticket price a tax right off. Not positive but you can look into it. And I am sure it cost a lot of money to run this place so I don't mind paying because you can see everything is very well kept. Their is plenty to learn and see!!!
3519,2012-12-05,5,"AWESOME!! entry is pricey, but your money is going to support and fund an amazing non-profit organization who's mission is to inspire conservation of the oceans.the monterey bay aquarium is fun, educational, inspiring and an overall great experience AND worth every penny."
3520,2014-07-06,4,"A visit to Monterey always includes a visit to the aquarium.  It's great for the entire family.   Enjoy two stories of sea life and while it can get busy, go early to avoid major crowds."
3521,2006-09-19,5,"I hadn't been to the aquarium in years and I completely forgotten how f-ing COOL it is.  I love this place.  It's actually a lot smaller than I remember, but then, I'm a lot bigger than I was some 15 odd years ago.What can I say about an aquarium?  Honestly.  I mean, I love the displays, but if I had to pick two things that were a must see:1.  The great white shark.  Seriously.  Most of us will rarely, if ever, get a chance to see one.  It's just a baby, but knowing that you're watching one of nature's greatest and most refined predators is mesmerizing.  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  Even the tuna (I had no idea they were so damn BIG) couldn't divert my attention2.  The otters.  Their just fun to watch.  Their like a pack of puppies running around.  If you don't smile when you're watching them, well, you have no hear.The other stuff is cool too, for sure.  The giant octopus, the jellyfish, the  tide pools, the kelp forests, all that.  It's a great time for 2-3 hours, and IMO, worth the cost.  Oh, definitely buy your tickets in advance.  It'll save you the headache I had of having to wait in a line stretched around the corner."
3522,2006-12-12,5,"Love it! I've always loved aquariums and I've been coming to this one since I was little. I recently went and visited the pengiun exhibit. Oh - they must be one of my favorite animals. If you go early in the day you can catch the feeding which is pretty interesting. Again, go early - b/c little kids over take that place in no time - and then you just want to stomp on them all b/c they're everywhere!! And I love kids, don't get me wrong. Or go on weekday."
3523,2007-02-16,5,"GO. NOW.THIS is the AQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC!  not that junk place in long beach.  the admission is pricey but once you take a peep inside, you'll know why (and be happy to support such a worthy organization).  it's like you've been transported into the depths of the ocean...all the exhibits are fantastic!the blue fin tuna was a sight to see.  the sea otters were adorable.  the jelly fish enchanting...oh, just GO. NOW."
3524,2008-01-07,5,"I've only been here once and absolutely loved it. Having also been to the Georgia Aquarium, I'd have to say that the Monterey Bay Aquarium's exhibits are better in general. Yes, the Georgia Aquarium's Beluga and Whale Shark exhibits are too impressive to ignore, but for everything else, I think that the Monterey Bay Aquarium wins hands down. Considering its size, the Monterey Bay Aquarium does a good job maintaining an aquarium feel without feeling overly commercialized. The great whites held in captivity have surely attracted much more attention to the aquarium in recent years, and I remember having to fight through a horde of people just to see the first one they had a couple of years ago.What makes the Monterey Bay Aquarium truly awesome is its location. After viewing everything that the aquarium has to offer, one can take a quick stroll outside around the Bay and see otters and sea lions in the wild. There are also some good restaurants within walking distance, so you can definitely plan a day at the aquarium and its surroundings. The aquarium is on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth the price of admission. If I lived within an hour or two of the aquarium, I'd definitely just buy an annual pass. The biggest drawback to this fine aquarium is its own popularity as you will find yourself literally swimming through a school of people just to view some of the more popular exhibits. However, this is cannot be held against the aquarium as its exhibits are truly in the realm of incredible and worth multiple visits anyway."
3525,2008-03-15,5,"OK. So I haven't been here for a really, really, long time. We did feel a little out of place since there were a million little kids running around the place (I'm sure I was one of them back in the day), but I still found this place great.  I was forewarned that it may be boring, so maybe because I went without expecting much - it made my experience even better. They definitely do a great job on all the displays. The jellyfish, outer bay, and sea otters were the best. I could probably sit in front of the large displays and watch the fish all day - they are all so mesmerizing! I was a little disappointed that a new section was only open to members only for a special preview and we were just 3 days shy of being able to see it. =( Although it was a great experience, I probably won't be back until I have kids and they are old enough to be awestruck by the beautiful sea animals (so maybe not for a long time!). By then, maybe they will change some displays and update the place a little bit."
3526,2008-03-17,5,"Ah yes, this would be my lovely neighborhood aquarium, and I know how to get in for free.  Feel free to hate me.......or bribe me to share the secret ; )"
3527,2008-04-17,5,"I can't wait to have kids so I can take them here! I am a 27-year old woman and I get excited about visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium still.The $25.00 admission is well worth it, and you know that it is going toward a good cause. Their exibits are wonderful and their presentations, if you happen to catch one, are so interesting. If you find yourself in the Carmel/Monterey area I HIGHLY recommend you visit the Aquarium here."
3528,2008-04-21,4,"We really enjoyed seeing the sea otters.  They are SOOOOOOOOOO cute and adorable.  They like to come up to the people standing at the windows and swimming around.  The other part I really enjoyed was the jellyfish.  They were really pretty.   We didn't get there til 4:30 and they closed at 6 so we were in a bit of a rush to see everything.  The 1 star off is 1) on the layout of the aquarium where the children play area is within each exhibit so for adults, I feel like we were constantly walking into a dead end section where the play area was and had to retrace our step out and 2) the admission fee is a bit pricy.This is a fun place to take adults and kids."
3529,2008-07-07,5,"You can spend hours and hours here. It's better than disneyland! and it only costs $25. the food selection is pretty good too and not too overpriced. with all the kids running around it gets pretty crowded on the weekends. i bet they could raise the price a little and no one would mind.the ""live shows"" are pretty interesting to attend; it's this weird hybrid of a slideshow and audience questioning."
3530,2008-07-28,4,"Wonderful place to visit! As close as you can get to scuba diving without getting wet. The three-story tall aquariums are a must-see.The Splash Zone, the area designated for kids, is utter chaos. Good luck to the parents who must take their little ones there."
3531,2008-12-01,5,"This place rocks! I fell in love with sea otters here when I was 10, and I fell in love with them again last weekend. I'm 23, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I was dying to get down here again, and what does my boyfriend do? Puts us up in a gorgeous little hotel (review to come), and takes me to the aquarium. Oh happy day!They have these baby skates (like rays). No, they're not even babies. They're embryos. And you can see them with your naked eye wiggling around in their little leathery pouch, growing and incubating. It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen!! Life in the making. Not on a screen. Not in a text book. Right in front of my face! I was transfixed. We spent hours in the aquarium. They have the most gorgeous jelly fish, and entire habitat, bigger than my old studio apartment for the most beautiful little birds. They go loping across their terrane of grass, and their webbed feet pass right by little fish in the water. This is indoors, remember. They have a kelp forest, with every kind of creature you would actually seeing swimming, scuttling or sucking along in it. 2 or 3 times a day they have a diver go in to feed they fish, sharks, etc, and they talk to you over a sound system while they're in the tank telling you all about the exhibit and it's inhabitants. I could go on for pages, but I won't. I'll finish by saying that this place is amazing for people of all ages. It inspires a reverence and joy in life and nature, and I am truly grateful."
3532,2008-12-09,3,"My uncle use to take me here every year for my birthday as a kid. They had an otter with the same name as me that I loved watching cause I called her ""my otter"".I came back with my mom, another one of my uncles, and my cousin a few years ago when they had a great white shark they all wanted to check out. Didn't enjoy it so much this time as I have a super phobia of octopi. When they all went to check out that exhibit I sat by myself outside. Don't think I will go again cause of my phobia which is sad cause this place is pretty cool."
3533,2009-03-03,5,"I absolutely love this aquarium.  OK, this place is big.  You can easily get lost in the mazes around this place.  They alter some exhibits over time, which makes the experience rather fresh.  I usually come here every 2-3 years.  They maintain the place very well and everything's clean.  You can actually see through the glass unlike some crappy aquariums.   The animals and other marine life look healthy.  The food is decent for cafeteria food.  I think the price was a little much, but I recommend going down Cannery Row (which is on the same street as the aquarium) or the Wharf and eat there.  The staff is really nice.  It's a great place to bring the kids.  There's a petting area for bat rays (they don't sting) and other smaller marine life like starfish.  I went here when I was like 5 and I've been spoiled by it.  I've always set this as a standard for other aquariums, so I get disappointed everywhere I go.  There's a couple of auditoriums that show the aquarium's brief history as well as marine life in the bay.  This aquarium is focused primarily on the Monterey Bay rather than the ocean in general.  There's nothing wrong with that, but don't expect to see a blue whale here.  They actually do a good job partitioning the facility into ""inner"" and ""outer"" bay exhibits.  Since it's a famous aquarium, it can be extremely crowded.  Parking can be a pain.  They have designated garages a few blocks away from the aquarium, which is fine I guess.  I mean, you can visit some shops and restaurants in Cannery Row while you're at it.  Some idiots bring their flash cameras into the dark deep sea rooms."
3534,2009-07-03,5,"I came here with my sweetie on a whim just for fun. This place is amazing. Great for all ages as everything is very age friendly. We went thru all the exhibits and my favorites happened to be the penguin feeding, jellies, and sting ray touch pool, even though I didn't get to touch any because the screaming and splashing children kept scaring them away. For about $30/adult I'd say it's worth it if you come in the morning when they open so that it's not overly crowded like it WILL be later in the day and you can venture in and out on Cannery Row as long as you get a blacklight stamp.The video presentations in auditorium are nice way to rest your feet and learn some things. We watched the videos on jellies and sharks.There was nothing bad about my visit to the Aquarium and I enjoyed every second there, 5 stars!!"
3535,2009-09-29,5,"My husband escorted me on my first trip ever here last week! It'd been about 10 years since his last visit. This is a world-class aquarium, so the high entrance price is totally justified.One practical lesson we learned was: Don't rush here on a non-summer/non-holiday weekday. I think we'd have enjoyed ourselves even more had we waited till about noon to enter. The line was long by 10 a.m., but it moved fast. The downside was the crowds that first entered. Nothing against school tours, but they are loud!  After the kids had gone through their displays, it was a much more quiet experience.So glad the Jelly Fish Exhibit was still on. For as much as I gross out at the site of a jelly washed on shore, I was even more amazed by their beauty behind glass :-) Absolutely amazing colors, textures and movements.The Sea Horse Exhibit was stellar as well. How can you not love a sea horse?!The Kelp Forest was my favorite big tank. And I loved the creative blend of outdoors with indoors via the Tidal Wave pool (outside it looks like a regular display of glass and water splashing over rocks, but inside you get to have the tidal wave rush over your head) and the Bat Ray/Coastal Birds area (you can gently pat any brave rays that come close enough to you - roll up your sleeves - and then walk through an outside enclosure and see birds up close).The Octopus diplay was disappointing since you couldn't really see it. Bunch of suction cups up in corner. I wanted to see it from above, creeping around.Fun exhibits for the kids...young and old. Who knew a sea cucumber feels like air? (I'd eaten a couple bites in China years ago and they are rubbery when cooked.) Great Otter and Penguin displays where you can observe feeding times.Definitely worth the trip and the tickets to go inside."
3536,2009-12-01,5,It has been so long since I have been the MBA. I forgot how fun it was. I had a blast my favorite exhibits were the Jelly fish and the Secret Lives of Seahorses. Both  beautifully created.  Get there early for the otter show people were packed in like sardines to see those little furry guys eat and I only stayed for a minute to let some little kids take my place. I had a great time  we checked it all out and were done with in a  few hours. I think the aquarium is an awesome experience and you should def check it out if you have never been or if its been awhile. Admission is kinda  high but look for coupons on their website.
3537,2011-06-19,1,"Absolutely, choked with crowds to the point where you can't turn around or take a step without being right in someone's face. It was stressful, chaotic and probably unsanitary (a kid threw up in the entrance room and people just tracked all through it). The price of the ticket was unreasonable. Apparently other people--including reviewers here--do not mind wading through hundreds of people and shuffling with shoulder-to-shoulder crowds from one exhibit to the next. This can only be enjoyable for those who grew up in a Third World country and are accustomed to suffocating crowds. We were told--while asking for our money back--that it was not an especially crowded day and that we ""should see it when the school kids come in!"" Yuck! I'm sure the exhibits are interesting but who would know? A great disappointment..."
3538,2010-03-18,4,"I'm a HUGE Finding Nemo fan so I spent the entire day quoting the movie which was actually great because I blended in with the little kids perfectly.  The seahorse exhibit was really cool because they have them at all different ages/sizes and I really liked watching the sea otters play with toys in the tank.  The touch tanks are awesome if you don't mind getting a bit wet from flailing children and the volunteers there are very helpful and knowledgeable.  We also watched the ""deep sea creature"" presentation in the auditorium which had a lot of cool video footage, definitely recommend it.  It was obviously geared toward kids so a little cheesy at time, but still awesome."
3539,2006-02-21,5,"My kids LOVED this place.  I ended up buying a season pass for $100 for two adults and two kids.  We can go anytime for a whole YEAR.  And, we get to enter through the special VIP entrance.  No more 25 minute lines to wait in!  Whoopeee!The Jellyfish exhibit is amazing.  By far my favorite.  I can't wait to go back.  It was really crowded on President's day, but now that I have a pass we can go back anytime for free.  We missed so much yesterday. It was just too crowded and cramped everywhere.The surrounding restaurants are yummy, and we took a load off at the beach down the street,  too.  It was a beautiful day.Can't wait to go back!"
3540,2006-08-29,3,"I will start by saying I am an avid lover of all things marine and enjoy going to aquariums. Everything there was very nice, it just didn't impress me enough to warrant the 2-hrs plus drive (which was beautiful by the way) to get there from SF/Oakland. If you happen to be near by Sea World, the same aquarium-type exhibits are much better.  Monterey Bay aquarium does not offer anything different or interesting. I suppose in this area this is probably the best thing around.  I agree that the Ocean Sunfish was fun to watch and rare, though.To their  credit, they had an interesting ""Jellies"" theme, which was interesting at first, but quickly became tiring after seeing several of the same species repeated over and over in different exhibits. I actually noticed this trend in several other common species though. The overall presentation was nice though, and really gives you the awe-inspiring/peaceful feeling one would expect when watching these animals.The major plus points I believe would be for kids/families -- they have extensive interactive kids areas.  They also have guides that walk around answering questions and giving mini-lectures, as well as short movies and presentations that are held periodically.Word of advice from the view of a day-trip: don't expect to spend the whole day at the aquarium. Allot maybe 3 hours and then park your car along the street near the beach after you are done at the aquarium (free, no meters...i think its called ocean view) and enjoy the serene, zen-like beach. DO NOT eat in the nearby restaurants, they are terrible, and overpriced (from experience).  The immediate surrounding area is an obvious tourist trap and is a waste of time, especially if you are like me and have seen fisherman's wharf a bunch of times."
3541,2006-10-24,5,"Edit: Went here again 4th of July weekend. Go see the new Sea Otter Exhibit. My favorite exhibit is the Jelly Fish. Love this place. I was first introduced to this place when I was in grade school. You know how the school took you there on field trips to learn about the creatures of the ocean. They have the sting ray tank, where you can reach in and touch the top of the sting ray.  Some of the exhibits are very interactive, which is a great thing to expose kids to. As an adult, I still love going to this aquarium because this is the only place in california where you can see a multitude of marine life all in one location."
3542,2007-06-12,4,"What a delighful place to visit, for the most part that is.  For the most part the displays are great.  They  integrate the natural sea water that they are adjacent to to keep a healthy environment for thier residents.  The jelly fish were spectacular!  There is an enormous sunfish in one of the large tanks that is a must see!There is a new sea otter exhibit that is fun to watch.  However the penguin display is a tragedy *%(#($(&^$!!!!!  It reminds me of some old zoo in the 70's where animals go crazy from their limited space and pace back and forth.  I believe that they should either give them an adequate environment or don't have them housed there at all.  Feel free to share your thoughts about the penguin display with me.  I was having a great time until I saw this part of the aquarium.Overall I think that they do try to educate the public about the local area fish, and in general about keeping water clean and safe for the creatures that inhabit it."
3543,2007-06-24,5,"Once every 5 years or so...At about $20/pop.. this is well worth the money...  but really only about half a day of looking around, enjoying the exhibits...  I've never been anywhere like this place(ok.. maybe sea world) and they have some REALLY cool stuff... I've been here during the clear days, the cloudy days, and in the evening a couple years ago for a company event.  All times were exceptional.  The whole cannery row area is pretty nice.. definitely a day trips worth to go and spend time."
3544,2007-07-11,3,"I hate to post a lower than average rating, but after the second visit in 3 years, both me & my wife agreed that we will definitely return to Monterey, but NOT the aquarium.Every aquarium needs at least 1 or 2 unique exhibitions to stand out.  Monterey Bay Aquarium has two -- Sea Otters and Jelly Fishes.  Other than these, the rests are quite mediocre.  In fact, most of the displays are quite tiny.  The penguins are boxed in a really shallow display container with minimal walking area for them.  The Sea Otters are protected behind a ribbon of small plexiglass where everyone has to press against during the feeding ""show"".  Many displays have less than two feet wide viewing glass.The shows in the theatres are mainly movies, but not as interesting as national geographics.However, the Jelly Fish is one of the best I've ever seen in the world.  Glowing orange/ Blueish jelly fish against the blue background is just phenomenal.  If I ever return again, it'd be beacuase of them.  (Or if I am forced to take my future kids to here) My conclusion:  For $22, it is worth going, but not a must-go."
3545,2007-08-23,4,"I can honestly say I was really really impressed.The last time I had been to the Aquarium I was probably 7 years old and I definitely don't remember it being so large, or as professional. While it did have the typical Aquarium exhibits, you know...the touch tanks with star fish and sea cucumbers and the windows full of colorful fish it also offered some unexpected surprises. The deep sea area was truly wonderful. The sea turtles, great white shark, sun fish and other goodies were truly a sight. Even the kid exhibits were adult friendly!  I'm embarrassed to admit that my boyfriend and I definitely were among the 6 year olds playing with interactive games and learning about how much milk baby whales consume. We went while they had the otter exhibit and who doesn't love otters?? After watching the 5 otters play with toys, swim and flirt with the onlookers I decided that I need one for a pet. If people have tigers for pets why can't I have an otter???  But I'm getting off track.... They have something for everyone to enjoy. Great for children and adults alike. And when I have kids, I definitely plan on bringing them here to learn and explore. And of course, a visit is not complete without a visit to the gift shop!!! Being a grown woman, I of course couldn't leave without a stuffed Penguin. (you know you'd want one too!!) And P.S. They even have a place where you can write a letter to the Governor (aka the Governator) and ask him to preserve our oceans and wildlife. You just fill out the card and slip it into the mail slot... I love when they make being politically active really really easy."
3546,2007-12-27,5,"I can't believe I've lived in the Bay Area my whole life and I went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for the first time last February. My parents must have seriously wanted to deprive me of a wonderful learning experience.Thankfully, my husband gave in to my wishes and took me there for my birthday and his family wanted to visit when they came this Christmas. First a couple of housekeeping issues:1) All of the garages and lots within a couple blocks of the aquarium were full by 12:30pm, likely due to our arrival time and the holidays. There's a $5 lot on Cannery Row next to the Monterey Plaza Hotel that was not very busy and a heck of a lot cheaper than some of the other lots.    2) You can purchase tickets online and pick them up at Will Call, thus passing up the ticket line at the front of the building.  3) The Splash Zone is closed for renovation right now, so if your kids like the touch pools, you may want to wait until they re-open that area.I find that pretty much all of the exhibits at the aquarium are utterly fascinating. My favorite is the Outer Bay exhibit. Right now they have a white shark in captivity, along with some yellowfin tuna, hammerheads, and two gigantic sunfish. Today I learned that the larger of the two sunfish is approximately 5,000 pounds. Yowzers!"
3547,2008-04-06,4,"25 dollas?!?Inflation has found a home in the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Nonetheless, I usually come here about every 2-3 years and have always enjoyed my visits.  The line to buy tickets is usually out the door on the weekends and it can feel like you're standing in line for the kid rides at Disneyland - complete with the sounds of children running figure eights around you, whining and crying.  I would definitely recommend buying tickets on their website to bypass this wait.  Despite being well past the age of most of its young visitors, I am still a kid at heart and this aquarium has never ceased to amaze me.   During past visits I have marvelled at the sight of the jellyfish exhibit (jellyfish come in colors???), laughed at the silly penguin antics (they pose for the camera!), and stood in fear standing in the shark tunnel (for a moment I thought I was in the Jaws movie).  Don't forget to step outside for a quick reprieve from the rambunctious tots and enjoy sweeping views of the Monterey Bay.  The weather is usually quite cold but mostly clear during the Spring and Fall months.  Their food is (of course) overpriced, but actually quite decent.  This is an awesome educational experience if you want to learn how to be E.C.  - they promote sustainability and conservation and have a quite a few exhibits showcasing that.  Expect to spend at least 3 or 4 hours here on the weekends and be prepared to wait your turn."
3548,2008-04-07,4,"There is NO PARKING ANYWHERE after 12pm. Everything is FULL!!!We decided to head out a later than usual to beat the rush of  'FIELD TRIP' kids who scream and cause a ruckus in the mornings. Which proved its point after we had lunch and found parking at about 2pm, and found them boarding school buses.The crowd was mostly of adults and some kids being looked after by their parents- who kept them in check thankfully.  I still can't believe its $25 a head to get in. And yet no one checks you in at the entrance, hmmm...The aquarium is officially done with remodeling since our last visit a  couple of years ago. They really have expanded. And still at my ripe old age, I wasn't bored with anything. There's always something to see and watch.  Ok, and maybe learn.All said and done, I definitely got a different experience from it as an adult compared to the visits when I was kid."
3549,2008-07-02,4,"Though this wasn't my first time to the Aquarium, I have no recollection of coming here as a kid with my parents, so it might as well have been my first time. Also.. keep in mind that I love outings like this, especially when there are so many visually pleasing/stimulating things to look at..With that said.. I HEART THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM!!! I had an awesome time here, watching the fish, seeing kids run around excited about the fish, staring at the jellyfish.. just the overall atmosphere of the place is amazing. And the area has so much history (especially for a Steinbeck fan). I would definitely come back.. hopefully on a day that isn't so crowded."
3550,2008-07-15,5,"Wow.I haven't been to here since I was a kid and it was fantastic. The deep sea portion with the jellyfish was really spectacular. I thought for sure our little one would be a little afraid since it was quite dark in the exhibit and it lead into where there are some really HUGE fish and sharks but, she took off and loved it. A bit frightening for me trying to chase her in the dark with a bunch of people not realizing there was a 2 1/2 foot tall person ""oohhing and ahhing"" at their knees. Luckily, no one was harmed.The otters were pretty cool and the tide pool area was great fun. The kelp forest was beautiful. Of course, it was a bit crowded but it is summertime.Pricey? Yeah. If I thought we would go a couple times a year I'd spring for the membership. I think in a couple of years we might. There isn't too much more to Monterey in that part of town. Unless you are looking for oversized stuffed animals or polar fleece zip ups that say ""Monterey"" on them."
3551,2008-07-23,3,"It took a group of 5 18 year olds about an hour to look through everything.We did have quite long stops here and there and even went outside to see the scenery of the ocean.However, I didn't feel like it was worth our 22 something dollars.There were a ton of people here from all ages.Finding parking is also a pain :("
3552,2008-09-21,5,"Visited the aquarium for the second time this year back on 9/14. I was lucky to go see the jellies display on its final day- it was amazing as usual. Now that the jellies display is gone it will be turned into a new Seahorse exhibit opening in April  '09. Not to worry, the jellies can still be found in other displays in the aquarium.Still, there is plenty to see. The enormous floor-to-ceiling tank filled with massive tuna and sharks alike is a don't miss.Very kid friendly (my nephews and niece loved the displays and all of the interactive parts!!) I'm sure I'll be back again someday."
3553,2008-09-25,4,"What else is there to say?  This aquarium is definitely the best in Northern California, if not the best on the West Coast.  After seeing the jellyfish exhibit, which really immerses you into its magic, the other wing of this aquarium is just decent.  I constantly recommend the jellyfish portion of this attraction as a must-see to any friends visiting Monterey.Overall, Monterey Bay Aquarium is very loud and extremely crowded, making it hard for a group of adults to enjoy themselves.  There are too many children on field trips and school outings, so it's difficult to sneak in a moment of silence.  Going back to the jellyfish exhibit, it really is the only peaceful portion of the aquarium as a whole.If you've been to other large aquariums, like Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa, you're less likely to be impressed with this establishment.  Even so, this attraction will not fail at being just mildly entertaining.  Definitely worth the price tag.  And again, see the jellyfish."
3554,2008-10-03,5,"When i was a kid i wanted to be a marine biologist. Really bad. We recorded shark week on discovery channel every single year (and this was with a VCR and tapes, way before the TiVos and DVRs that are such a luxury to you damn kids these days...). Somewhere in there things got messed up and now i'm an engineer. I'll take the trade.Anyway, my family had friends on the Central Coast, so most summers we would venture out from the heat and humidity of Houston to go out to California. The Monterey Bay Aquarium was always a place that i demanded we go. The place seemed huge to me. I would demand that we got there as early as we could and then stay as late as possible as i explored the world that was the ocean.  loved the huge kelp forest tank, the jellyfish, the ray tank (you can touch them!), the tide pool exhibit, going out on the deck and cramming endless quarters into the view finder things, hell, i even loved the gift shop (though i don't think i was ever allowed to buy anything there). When i was 8, this place was heaven, absolutely as good as it gets.After college i moved out to Silicon Valley with my girlfriend for a job. After a few months we were looking for something to do for the upcoming weekend and decided to drive down to Monterrey and see the aquarium (she has family that live up here, so it was always a favorite destination of hers too. See, the kid from Texas and the sophisticated girl from Oklahoma were meant to be together!).Well, naturally, it wasn't nearly as big as we had remembered. And last time each of us came, we weren't responsible for paying for the tickets ($25 per person seems little steep to me). Suffice it to say, it wasn't quite as awesome as we remembered, but expectations were so high that we were destined for disappointment. It was still very cool though. Jelly fish exhibit is cooler than it used to be. Kelp tank is still really impressive. Touching the rays isn't as awesome as it used to be but is still neat. The new otter exhibit is really cool. The fresh water otters are a little weasley, but the ocean otters are very cute.Its still hands down, one of the coolest aquariums i've ever been to. Certainly worth stopping by and plunking down the cash for the whole family if you're in the area."
3555,2008-11-12,5,"Brought my new hubby here and I think he had as good of a time as he did at Disneyland. I haven't been here in 15 years, but it is still as wonderful as I remember. The huge whales and dolphins floating from the ceiling, the sea otters, the kelp forest at feeding time, the touch pools, the octopus, it is all wonderful. We spent a solid 3 hours here wondering at every exhibit, looking at the beauty. As for admission, I was impressed. It was only $25 per adult, which after paying $69 a piece for Disneyland, I thought was a screaming deal. I would suggest going in the off season. We went in November and there were kids but not so many that I was ready to volunteer for a hysterectomy or anything."
3556,2009-01-27,4,"It was our first time here yesterday and we loved it so much that we bought a membership here. The Asian girl at the ticket purchase counter was a bit rude and not helpful at all. The rest of the staff was very friendly and very informative when we asked questions. My fave exhibit is the penguins. I saw two of them mating when I was there. It was hilarious! When they were done, the female penguin stuck her butt over the water's edge and pooped. I got a good laugh out of that.I wish they had extended hours instead of closing at 5pm."
3557,2009-02-21,4,"Note to self...don't visit an attraction like the Monterey Aquarium on a holiday weekend. Looking at the sea life, moving so smoothly and with such grace would typically be quite relaxing...but not the day we went. I think this is a great place to take children and go as a family for sure. Don't get me wrong, Daniel and I had a great time and are glad that we experience the aquarium. I wish that we could have gone on a day that maybe would not have been so busy. I feel like I spent a lot of the time moving around people and trying to not step on the little ones. Be careful when you go, it is dark in certain parts of the exhibit. I would recommend this for sure!"
3558,2009-06-24,5,"What's not to love about the BEST aquarium in the U.S.! I've been to really nice ones in SF, Baltimore and Long Beach but my heart belongs to Monterey Bay Aquarium.We had 3 families go this time with three 4/5 year olds and three toddlers. There is plenty of space for them to go crazy! But watch for the crowds in the tightly-packed Splash Zone. In some places you have to leave your stroller outside of the exhibit, so don't load it up with too many valuables!Yes, there is the sea life, but my 5 yr old liked the outdoor ""live show"" with the song and dance ""Reduce Reuse Recycle."" And she was fascinated with the signs on the toilet that said ""Flush Up for liquid waste, Down for solid waste."" At least she's learning how to save the environment!The jellies are beautiful to watch. Sea otters were cute. Kelp forest is gorgeous. The Outer Bay feeding was very cool -- this is the million-gallon tank with sharks, rays, tuna fish and a huge school of sardines -- of course we couldn't help but think of the Fish School impressions by ""Cliff Clavin"" in Finding Nemo! (Speaking of, you will find one exhibit with Nemo, Dory and Gill in the Splash Zone.)Also loved the newer exhibit, the Secret Life of Seahorses, especially learning that the MALES get pregnant! We went on father's day, so we moms were quick to point that out to the dads. :)Did I tell you I love this aquarium?"
3559,2009-07-29,3,"3.5 stars.I enjoyed the aquarium, and with all the time I've spent in Monterey, I'm still surprised at myself that I haven't been here before.  But I guess I was expecting way more than what I actually got.30 bucks a person.  Ok fine, I thought we'd be there at least 3 or 4 hours.  We got through the whole thing in an hour and a half.  Queue disappointment.  The exhibits were awesome, my favorite was the jellyfish.  And it was cool watching the kelp forest feedings.  But my goodness it's so crowded.  I felt like I was rushed to look at things because there was a hord of people around me waiting to look at the same things.  I did like touching the starfish and sea urchins, but was disappointed that I didn't get to feed the bat rays.  There were so many people feeding them, that by the time I finally got to the edge of the pool, the rays were full so I didn't even bother trying to feed them calamari.  I liked how they had interactive things for kids, so I know I'll be back when I have little ones of my own.  But for a couple, we were over it pretty quick."
3560,2009-08-20,5,"I absolutely LOVE this place!!  I truly believe that I would like to add to my 5-year plan: ""become a sea otter!""  I would love to swim around, eat fresh seafood on my belly as I back-float along, play with toys, and nap in between...I have a membership pass, and it's definitely a great get-away when the concrete jungle gets too claustrophobic.......just make sure you go during off-season/down times (not summer, not weekends) to avoid the crowds! I just brought my grandparents here (who haven't been here in over 15 years) and they seriously found their inner-child!! Running around from viewing-window to the next, pointing out all the sea creatures they were amazed with, and exclaiming how they used to PLAY/CATCH/EAT that when they were younger in the Philippines!  One in a million type of memory!!!Like going to Yosemite (or hiking), we need a place like this to remind us of our (in)significance in the natural world...how we damage, live, and co-exist with(in) in. Love, Love, Love the aquarium!"
3561,2009-09-20,4,"Highlights: Sea Otters, Penguins, JellyfishLowlights: Crowds, Maze-like mapSeriously, the Jellyfish are amazing.  Check them out.  The sea otters are really amusing too, although you're definitely going to be fighting the crowds to get a good view.  Get there early to get a good seat for the sea otter feeding, and don't let the little brat kids running around get in front of you.Definitely worth checking out once every year or two."
3562,2009-09-29,5,What can be said that has wasn't already said in almost 700 reviews. So I will just say I got a membership which was very reasonable and I will be visiting the aquarium about  once a month if possible. I love love love it here and I could sit and stare at the jelly fish and sea horsies forever! I already went twice last week but prior to that it had been over 10 years. I don't know what took me so long to come back but I am glad I did.
3563,2009-10-12,4,"Unless you're a kid, or a parent of kids, this place isn't THAT exciting. Sure, there are a few must see classic exhibits (Jellyfish, Otter), but the amount of kids running around and the large crowds on the weekends make this place difficult to enjoy yourself. If you really are interested in the hyped up Secret Lives of Seahorses exhibit, I would recommend you visit it the first thing in the morning. During the afternoons, it gets so packed in there that it feels and smells like a crowded gym.It also saddened me as I was walking around the aquarium that I was hungry for some classic Fish and Chips, potentially a cousin of the fishes I was viewing."
3564,2011-07-16,5,"This is the place to be. We take in the Aquarium 6 to 7 times a year and it is just not enough. I just took my parents a couple months ago. They were in ah. Today was a special day for me I took my 12 year old son and my 12 year old nieces to see the NEW Open Ocean Exhibit and the Rescue Pup all day they were saying WOW, WOW! To cool. But to finish the day off I proposed to my girlfriend in front of the Kelp Forrest (her favorite spot) and she said YES. So defiantly a special place in my heart."
3565,2013-09-06,1,"do not go here if you have epilepsy,  this place is bigoted and a deathtrap for epleptics.  furthermore they simply do not care, they will tell you to leave if you are epileptic."
3566,2012-03-16,5,"Best Aquarium we have been to.  It makes the one in San Diego seem like a school project.  Sorry Birch aquarium.... Our attention was held the entire time here.  If I am ever approached by a small beautiful silver fish I will know if you are an anchovy or a sardine, does your tail swish side to side or look like scissors closing?  Sea Otters are the funniest animals ever!  I would definitely want to visit here again.  Take your time and see everything you won't be disappointed.  Don't tell anyone but I think I even liked it better than Sea World.  I am so over the splash zone."
3567,2011-05-31,2,"I hate to give the Monterey Bay Aquarium two stars... I mean - I really appreciate what they are trying to do...The exhibits seem wonderful for children but two adults wandering around would be able to finish the place in about 60 - 90 minutes.  I thought the aquarium was a lot more expansive than it actually is.  If you are coming from abroad and have a thing for aquariums, check out the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.  The price tag of $30 per adult is way too expensive.  I hope they do cheap cheap family passes as this is a kid-centric place and would likely work out much better for their revenues and for families.We actually liked the Academy of Sciences in SF better both for its diversity of exhibits and presentation.Again - Monterey Bay Aquarium rock on with your educational mission but please make it more affordable - especially considering your name brand donors;)"
3568,2014-08-14,1,"Far too expensive.  Spent $110 for my wife and daughter and me.  Unless you are a devoted fish fanatic, skip it.  You can see everything in a couple of hours and the place is packed.  Don't bother.  If you have little kids, go to the Dennis the Menace playground--it's free and much more fun."
3569,2013-09-20,5,Check out the Open Ocean feeding- sardine school is really amazing. Also the educational presentations in the auditorium are phenomenally well executed and provide more in depth information than most of the exhibits.
3570,2007-03-30,5,"Oh, Wow!  I love it!  i made a special trip to see this aquarium.  its really great.  its very pretty, too.wow, i love the jellies, they are so fascinating.  i liked the otters and the kelp forest too.  i like that you can go outside and look at the bay.  i like everything, i think. ok not really.  i'm scared as shit of the big creepy sun fish.  Aughhhhhhhh!  ok, wow, those eels are very scary too.i like the old man who showed me the otter fur and talked about the otters.  they teach you a lot here, if you want.  obviously because there were lots of school children.  i think that place must be busy every day.  i arrived at 9:45 am and there was already a line!  but it was really fast.i think i had a good time and enjoyed my day.  I was there 4 hours but I could have stayed longer if i had time.  the only bad part about my special trip was i ordered korean chicken with short grain rice at the cafe.  the rice wasn't short grain.  i looked and i said, wow, this rice is much too long.  oh well, i still liked the flavour."
3571,2007-07-31,3,"DO NOT GO ON THE WEEKEND.  If possible avoid the Aquarium on the weekend at all costs.  The place was a zoo: the line to buy tickets was over 200 feet long and there were unruly kids everywhere.I'd like to rate it a 4 for the exhibits, but because of the crowd I felt like I was just going through the motions and looking at every exhibit.  I'm not a ageist, child-hater, but I do hate misbehaved children and their parents, which were in abundance at the aquarium.  The wait to get to the front of an exhibit is long enough, but once you get to the front a couple kids will shove right out in front of you and step on your toes until you move back to make space.Overall, it was difficult to enjoy anything because of the crowds, but I don't know if I would've been all that impressed had there been less people.  The best exhibits were the jelly fish and otter tanks.My review was not so much a rating of the facilities of the aquarium but mainly of the experience I had going on the weekend.  Truth be told, the aquarium is a top notch facility and a great learning experience for all, including rude snot nosed kids.  I'd recommend going, just not on a weekend.  However, if you must: do it earlier or later than usual and buy tickets ahead of time - OH and one last thing, don't forget your boogie man mask to keep kids from stepping on your toes."
3572,2007-08-17,4,"I'm torn between rating the Aquarium high or low.. you see, I had something close to a mental breakdown here, because it's so freaking CROWDED.Actually, I'm not kidding. It was really really crowded, and I'm something of a claustrophobe, and I freaked out and hid in a corner until my traveling companions found me. I could not cope with being there.Although, another day i went was with a coworker who happens to be a donator, so we went during a donation event, and the place was *empty* it was so beautiful, and wonderful and.. i spent the whole time pointing at fish and telling them that they would be awfully tasty in my mouth. this place truly is magical, educational, and fun.I hear evenings and weekdays (mornings) are the best times to visit to avoid crowds. Honestly, i won't be going back until I become a member, as I hear they have members -only nights (which are bigger than the donators only nights I mentioned previously, but still supposed to be far more manageable) which should be less.. painful of an experience for me."
3573,2008-01-20,5,"World class! A must visit and worth a drive from San Francisco. You really do get a great vibe of what the Pacific is all about. FYI: They filmed parts of Star Trek IV here. Need to know information, right?"
3574,2008-01-28,3,"It's still fun, but it's slid a bit.Fewer exhibits, and the tanks are just not as nice as they used to be.I've been coming here for decades and on my latest visit I was disappointed.  Things should be changing, growing, improving.  Instead the opposite.  The big shark tank is looking empty, fewer jellyfish, the kelp forest is thin, and one wing of the building only has sea otters.  They need to get more in there, if you go to other exhibits around the world this one really pales.   Considering how much tourism this brings to Monterey, add bigger tanks, more exotic and impressive fish, and the wraparound underwater immersion tubes that are seem to be popping up in all the new aquariums.Families can still definitely have a blast here but just hanging out at the real tidepools down the block is just as fun."
3575,2008-03-23,5,"Learned more and faster than ever.I went here last weekend and had a great time. Walking and exploring every exhibit was fun as well as exciting. The aquarium is so user friendly and hands on, they have a lot of extracurricular activities for any age group. Plus, at one exhibit you can actually touch marine life like, sea rays, star fish, snails, sea urchins and more. They have created a good visitors guide that is easy to follow and fully informative to any guest.Check Out:Kelp ForrestTouch PoolsSea OttersJellies Living Art OctopusTide Pool*New* Penguin HabitatFeeding Times:Kelp Forrest:11:30AM,4PM DAILYSea Otters:10:30AM,1:30PM,3:30PM DAILYOuter Bay11am T/R/S/SThe coolest part of my time was watching the Mahi Mahi(dolphin fish), Ahi Tuna, sharks, sardines, and many more eat dead jelly fish and sardine parts.  Watch the tuna as they ram into anyone getting in their way of food. See the dolphin fish turn their bodies yellow as they fight for food.  One thing I like about the aquarium is their staff, friendly(actually smiles and says ""hi""), knowledgeable about the animals and fish, and patient enough to answer all the questions people have."
3576,2008-04-13,5,"I definitely enjoy visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- it's not only educational but it's also lots of fun!  The exhibits are amazing -- the kelp forest display, sharks, sea otters, penguins, tuna, the schools of anchovies, and the many different array of colorful jellyfish.  I also enjoy the panoramic views standing out on the decks.Overall, a great place to visit and enjoy the wonderful exhibits!"
3577,2008-05-27,4,"It worth the ticket, and worth us driving down there from san mateo.very educational, with a lot of fun!  The sea otters are so lovely!!Only problem this is the parking issue...  will return  in future with my mom~it's a very good place to spend family day with kids, parents!"
3578,2008-08-05,4,"Great place to bring kids. They educate them, and have little learning centers, and interactive centers for them to do activities in. You can touch some stuff, like sea cucumber, kelp, starfish, sea urchins and things of that sort. They have shows throughout the day too. It's a pretty updated aquarium, really clean too. Lots of fish to see and exhibits to visit.I recommend coming in the morning, around 10 or so, because when I was leaving around noon, the line was so long! They had people waiting OUTSIDE of the building, and boy... there were lots of people! Parking can be an ass too if they arrive to late... so go earlier when the parking garages and lots still have space!"
3579,2008-09-02,5,"*ahem*HAMMERHEAD SHARKS!!  This aquarium has *hammerhead* sharks!!!  My land-locked ass was (and is) totally captivated by that exhibit.  The jellyfish were beautiful and mesmerizing.  The sea otters were too cute to still be fair to the other animals.  The two-story kelp forest was really striking.  They had two, count 'em, TWO giant octopuses (sadly, both were feeling shy the day of my visit).  They had huge Sevengill sharks, which were also way fun to watch.  But, honestly, I think my head exploded with joy when I got to see a real, live cuttlefish.  Too much joy for one small girl from Wisconsin, really.This was definitely one of the highlights from my recent trip to San Francisco.  Beyond that, it was one of the best ways I've ever spent $25."
3580,2008-10-01,5,"Jellyfish ftw!This place is a great thing to do for a date or even just for fun. A lot of people on the weekends which may consist of some rude people...BUT that's OK.My favorite starfish is the leather star cause it's so slimy/smooth! Haha I kept petting it and not moving along in the line. Our hands also stank of the water, but good thing they have hand sanitizer.Many nice people did offer to take our pictures. =)Everything was really enjoyable and fun =)BUT the stingray petting zoo...they tend to not swim to the edge so good luck on that."
3581,2008-12-30,4,"This place is great. Modern and educational aquarium. I wish it was bigger, because I want more of it! Jelly fish exhibit is note worthy. The Portola restaurant was surprisingly good. We decided to ditch the long line and scurrying kids at food court and treat ourselves to a relaxing sitting dinner. I never knew I can get a fresh, local gourmet lunch in an aquarium."
3582,2009-01-19,5,"Im in love with this place! I suggest to go on a weekday if possible. During the weekends they get a large crowd and it be too hard to really look at all of the exhibits. My favorite section is the jelly fishes and the large tank which looks like a huge movie screen, they have benches were you can relax and enjoy all of the fishes swimming. Its pretty relaxing its a must see.There is no free street parking in the area you would need to pay."
3583,2009-01-28,5,-WOW!Yep that's really it. Just wow!Penguins. Jellyfish. Sharks. Fish and even more fish!My favorite- the sea otters.They also teach about sustainability for what we eat. The type of fish that is over fished and what is safe for us to eat. As a sushi lover I am more aware of what I should eat to keep the ocean filled with yummy fish.I love the idea that when they capture wildlife they release them back to the ocean 6 months later. It's like sabbatical for the sea creatures.
3584,2009-07-22,5,"I went here with my sisters and we had an awesome time. It was my first time going and it was an great site, I love to learn about miscellaneous stuff. My 12 year old sister thought it was pretty cool too.  Its got a lot of rooms ranging from touching manta rays, looking at one gigantic two story fish tank of fishes including blue fin tuna, sharks, and octopus, to a jellyfish room and more.  This is a great way to take a day and enjoy the place, a few hours at the aquarium and then spending the rest of time sightseeing and eating on the pier that is right outside the pier... perfect!"
3585,2009-09-17,5,"This place is as good as it gets as far as I'm concerned. We paid the extra $10 for the 'behind the scenes tour.' It was ok but not great. If you're worried about money skip this extra tour, but if you have an extra $10 in your pocket, it's probably worth using it to go on the extra tour.The white shark was awesome, the jellyfish and seahorses were great too, but my favorite were the sea otters."
3586,2009-11-29,5,"Been to many aquariums and this is definitely the best. Great diversity, stunning exhibits, lots of hands on activities for the younger (and young at heart) set, and a ton to see. Not cheap, so plan on spending some time there to get every penny's worth. Shop around for parking...on one corner was a lot charging $20, but drive around the corner and it was $5."
3587,2010-01-17,5,"1st time I went to the MBA was when I was in elementary school and we had a field trip to the Aquarium......and ever since I've been hooked. Granted back in the early 90's the jellyfish exhibit wasn't was it is now, but the exhibits have gotten so much better! Its a great place to bring the lil ones where - the aquariums experts can answer all their questions, while your touching weird squishy, slimy, poky things....lol!!!.....and of course there is this Wave thing...where you stand in this tunnelish area and BAM!!!! waves fall on you....well on the tunnel actually..but its really real!  My two favorite exhibits - (1) the BIG Tank (2) everything else! :-D"
3588,2010-02-18,5,"Just what Yelp needs: ANOTHER review of the Monterey Bay Aquarium! Ahh, but mine has a unique catch to it. You see, I grew up literally at the Scripp's Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla. My parents would take us kids there a couple of times per year. When they built the Birch Aquarium right across La Jolla Shores Drive-we were right there too.The Birch Aquarium is wonderful and has great displays of marine life, but there ain't nothin that can compare with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.It is the Filet Mignon of steaks to the others chuck roasts or hamburgers!  A state- of- the-art monument to the greatness and awesomeness of our seas.Perched among Cannery Row and standing out among the many shops and restaurants that line the street, Monterey Aquarium is a must-see for anyone claiming to love and care about our oceans.I took both my kids and got there right when they opened because I dislike congestion when I am immersing my off spring in educational jaunts. The strobe-lit jellyfish exhibit was mind-blowing. I never realized those creatures you strive so hard to avoid contact with at the beach are so beautifully languorous and sensual in movement.Yes-the sea horses are adorable but I was lucky enough to visit when they had the great white sharks  The Monterey.Aquarium's White Shark Project promotes innovative study and conservation of these magnificent animals. Exhibiting white sharks  helps to promote public understanding and protection of this ecologically important and threatened species. Eventually all are released back into the wild.After visiting the Aquarium, we all took off on a stroll down the beach-north of the Aquarium and what should playfully be following  us along in the water but a seal lion-probably on the way up to San Francisco to bask among the tourists at Fisherman's Wharf.I was immediately charmed and thought to myself-what a touching way to conclude this visit to the Aquarium-by having a friendly seal lion wave us adieu.  Absolutely not- to- be missed attraction and would award it stars beyond 5, if available!"
3589,2011-08-20,3,"Just like previous reviews, the place is visually impressive, but it can be ruined by huge crowds. We won't return unless we can be sure we can walk around and see the sights without having to fight through rows and rows of people, many of whom push and shove their way in front of others, even little kids! We went on a Monday and were literally unable to see 50% of the displays/exhibits due to the massive amounts of people there."
3590,2011-05-28,3,"Perhaps I am just spoiled, or maybe my expectations too high, but I thought this place was just OK.  They do a great job with their dispays, and I guess all of the save the envionment stuff is appropriate -but there wasn't anything over the top or ultra fantastic.  Great place to wander around, a little pricy for the offerings, and fun to take kids.  The windows for the pinguin and otter feedings are way too small for all patrons to comfortably enjoy.  The docents very knowledgeable and friendly.  Oh, and the jellyfish exhibit was closed.  LAME!"
3591,2010-03-28,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the coolest things to do in Monterey.  They also frequently switch up the attractions so what you see one time may be different the next time you visit. I am in the veterinary profession and I find that the staff and exhibits are amazing!  Also, if you plan your trip in advance you can sign up to do morning rounds at the aquarium.  Morning rounds include getting to go behind the scenes and see how the aquarium works.  From feeding to learning about the animals at the aquarium this is a great experience.  Check out the details on their website if interested.  The aquarium is great for people of all ages and is completely worth checking out!"
3592,2012-02-22,4,"I really enjoyed visiting this beautiful aquarium.  The sea horse exhibit was my favorite part, it's awesome.  I also really liked the otters, but who doesn't enjoy those little fellas, right?  The only downside to this aquarium were the ""global warming"" signs they had posted all over the place.  I support their right to wear tin foil hats and chant about things together, but I prefer they do it where I don't have to see it."
3593,2013-08-22,1,"I have been to this aquarium 3 different times over the years starting when  it first opened and then again  10 years later then again today. Today was completely disappointing. This is not the aquarium that I remember. They have jacked up the prices and replaced most of their aquariums with ""art"" or animated displays. This was my third and last visit to this place. Our aquarium in Seattle is amazing compared to this place and we also visited the Steinhart aquarium while we were in San Francisco and that made this place look like a joke. I would never pay such an outrageous price to see nothing. The people are rude and you can't even see the few exhibits they have anyways because people just stand in front of the aquariums and don't move for prolong periods of time. We were only there for about an hour. Never again."
3594,2011-04-30,2,"i am truly surprised by the over ratings this place gets.  I was most disappointed.  my wife and I came to monterey last year and didnt get a chance to go to the aquarium because we took too long, no regrets, getting down the coast.  we were saddened by not having enough time to go to the aquarium.  we had heard that this is one of the best aquariums in the US, and i, now having gone here today was so so disappointed.  it was junk.  i had more fun at the aquarium on the big island than this one and that one is as small as a shoebox.  also the one in chicago is way better.  im so happy that i was with good friends, and ended the night by going to passionfish, which was amazing, otherwise i feel as the 4 hours of driving roundtrip for that subpar performance of an aquarium would have ruined my whole day."
3595,2012-07-27,5,"We love this place! My son had so much fun and couldn't get enough of all the different marine life to see. The touch pools are awesome, and the jellyfish were our favorite"
3596,2011-08-04,5,"Ive been going here for a few years now, and its just as magical as the first time I walked in. Amazingly beautiful, and very well laid out."
3597,2011-08-01,5,"One of the best aquariums I have been to. I live in the area and have visited the aquarium several times. Whenever we have company from out of town we always take them here. My son loves going to the aquarium. They have a great sea horse exhibit, the sea horses and the jelly fish always fascinate me. They have wonderful exhibits, friendly and knowledgeable volunteers. A great kid friendly place. If you are in Monterey, this is a place that you must stop and visit. They have a wide variety of exhibits, an outdoor area to over look the ocean. They have a nice food court and gift shop. The price is reasonable."
3598,2010-12-24,1,"I could not enjoy watching the animals try to act normal in their man made habitats. Honey took me here for our anniversary, and I just couldn't get into it. I think it was way too crowded, and there was way too many children. It was really loud. I enjoy the museum more, because even if it's crowded, people know to be more demure, and they are so quiet that you can drown them out. I couldn't drown out the people who were there. The saddest part was when I went to the birds area and saw such beautiful FLIGHTLESS birds. Their wings had been clipped. This really depressed me, and then I started to think about how all the animals were forcibly caged, and we were paying for their enslavement.....yeah really depressing stuff. Don't come here if you are an animal lover like me."
3599,2012-03-11,2,"It is a great aquarium, but I think it is overpriced for the amount of time someone spends in there. We were there from around 1130 to 145, and the kids (ages 7&10) were quite over the whole thing about 1/2 way through. We paid about $105 to get in. It takes me about 4 hours to make that amount of $ at work, and it hurts to only have spent a little over 2 hours there! They had more fun at the beach and The Little Mermaid Glass Bottom Boat Tour, which I thought was pretty lame. Wish I could find a way to review them!"
3600,2014-09-11,5,"Must see when you are out in Monterey. Great team, knowledgable staff and lots to learn and experience. Wonderful for kids!"
3601,2012-07-10,5,Entertaining. Compelling.  Educational.  Outstanding way to spend most of a day.
3602,2011-08-03,5,"Best Aquarium hands down in the Bay Area. offers a variety of displays from Tunas, Sharks, Octopus, Penguins, Birds,, Flamingos, and can i say OTTERS. the Otters and the Octopus are probably the most popular displays here. there's a room where you can touch sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea stars. they offer scuba diving if you have some cash to shell out. overall great place to go the only downside is that it gets really crowded and hard to take pictures sometimes especially if flash is not allowed and you're in a dark place"
3603,2006-08-28,5,I do believe that this place speaks for itself. They have gone through great lengths to provide an educational facility that is both entertaining and more than informative. Their continued effort to educate (humans) and rehabilitate (animals) makes them wonderful.Be sure to check out the circular room with the sardines swimming in a circle above. The acoustics of the room make it possible for many cool tricks. :)
3604,2006-10-03,5,One word -- jellyfish.Great display.  Learn to love the jellyfish now since the oceans will have very little besides them if people keep eating sushi like there's limitless tuna in the ocean.Probably the best aquarium that I've visited.
3605,2006-10-31,5,"Everyone knows it's great... just a few insights.  We arrived a hour before closing on a weekday, which worked extremely well to our advantage.  There were no lines to get in.  The aquarium wasn't nearly as crowded as I imagine it would be on a weekend.  So we were able to see everything in a hour and not feel rushed.Because they were closing soon, the lady at the front (bless her soul) knocked a ton of money off the admission price.  We paid something like $10 a person to get in."
3606,2007-02-21,5,Can't go wrong learning something.$24 entrance fee. Try to score some coupons or AAA discounts.
3607,2007-08-21,5,"Came here a while ago, but recently came to Monterey so had to review it anyway. Came here with my nephews and it was my first time here. The place is amazing. Great exhibits and good size, too.My nephews came here a couple a times, so not as excited, but did have a good time anyway. This place is great for families, couples, educators, etc. It's a great place period."
3608,2008-03-23,5,"After visiting the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago and the the Atlanta Aquarium, Monterey still takes the prize with the ocean view setting, complete with otters and sea lion viewing from the outer decks in the Bay.We joined the aquarium a few years ago, and usually visit a couple times a year.  As a member, seems to be the best way to see things in off hours. My son anxiously waited until he was old enough to to do the SCUBA dive in the lagoon, that  was a great experience.  Early morning midweek is still the best, weekend crowds can be overwelming."
3609,2008-04-22,5,"ABSOLUTELY my FAVORITE aquarium in the world!I have been a couple of times, and each time it gets better.  There are lots of people which makes it difficult to see all the exhibits (especially because of all the kids running around), but please don't let that prevent you from going.  It is GREAT!The ""Jellies"" (jellyfish) exhibit is my favorite and the tank with the various types of tuna is incredible during their feeding time.  A MUST SEE!!!!If you go to Monterey and DON'T go to the Aquarium, you are MISSING OUT on the BEST attraction in the entire area!"
3610,2008-05-28,5,"There is a friggin bar in the friggin aquarium.I got to drink like a fish, and look at fish.The sharks, the squid, the sea otters, the jellies!  Try to make it for one of the feedings in the kelp forest."
3611,2008-07-16,5,"I really enjoyed my visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium! The building has many huge aquariums that bring you face to face with the under sea world. The otters and jellies were a special joy to see. The artistic display of the jellies exhibit was amazing and drew me in;  I spent a lot of time there. Make sure to check out this exhibit before it is gone in September. Another aspect I enjoy about the aquarium is that it sits right on the ocean/Monterey Bay and incorporates that into its design. There are outside areas with benches, where you can take a break, get some fresh air  and watch the waves on the rocks (and if you're lucky, sea otters) before going back inside and continuing your tour. The staff was very helpful and friendly. One enthusiastic staff member answered our seafood questions professionally while providing us with the Seafood Watch pocket guide. This guide is also available online through their website, and provides information on ocean-friendly seafood consumption.As others mentioned, there are a lot of children especially on weekends, so if this bothers you, then I would go at another time. The price is a little high, but I have to agree that this is one of the better aquariums I have been to. It was worth the price since we made a whole day out of driving down to MB, then on to Carmel. What beautiful scenery! If you are new to the west coast or visiting, definitely drive through the area.We waited for only about 20 minutes in a line outside on a sunny day. But I found out later we could have bought our tickets online in advance, so I would advise doing that to avoid any lines."
3612,2008-08-11,5,What an amazing place! You could spend hours in here! I enjoyed the fish feeding at 4PM! A scuba diver got in the tank and swam and fed the fish. A must see!Best aquarium in the world! :)
3613,2009-01-01,4,"Houses native CA sea life. Don't expect the foreign and exotic.Loved the kelp forest, jellyfish, penguins and sea otters. Can get crowded-but great educational experience. Go early to avoid the crowds."
3614,2009-04-27,5,"My favorite aquarium so far.  The tanks are well done and the educational aspect of the aquarium is first rate!  It's a large aquarium and the setting is spectacular.  The glimpses of the coast and ocean as you wander the exhibits is beautiful.  We went on a quiet day and spent a good hour talking with husbandry staff and docents as we went through, everyone was happy to talk about the operations of the place, it was almost as good as a behind the scenes tour.  We just missed the Great White, they released her 2 weeks before we made it, and the weather was cold so they didn't have anything going on in the outdoor area.  I highly recommend this aquarium, go on an off day, take your time and mingle with the staff, it will be well worth it."
3615,2009-05-23,5,Great place to go when you have a 4 yr old... My daughter absolutely loved it.  Great family destination.
3616,2009-07-15,5,LOVE THIS AQUARIUM! It is the BEST I have been to yet! We have been to many Aquariums from Long Beach to Maui and I have to say this one beats them all! It is so good that my family and I have been there twice! I have to say that it is on the expensive side but WAY worth every penny that you spend. Not to mention all the proceeds go to a good cause. If you are in Monterey you have to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium!
3617,2009-09-09,5,"Fantastic aquarium for children and adults.  There are lots of different sections and activities, including awesome exhibits on seahorses, jelly fish, sharks, beautiful tropical fish, sea otters, schools of fish, and more.  There's an area where kids could hold starfish and other shellfish, a theatre that features different shows.  The building itself is well maintained, clean, and high tech looking.  It's incredible that it's a nonprofit organization.  I really feel good supporting nonprofit orgs like this that is also well run and fun for the whole family.  Aquatic research is also important.Get the Family annual pass which pays for itself after 2 visits, and you bypass the lines on the weekends.There are also many fun seafood restaurants within walking distance.  People were flying kites at a nearby beach."
3618,2010-02-16,5,"I was there yesterday (Preasidents Day) with my two kids and we had a fantastic day. Even the fact that it was a holiday and a little bit crowded could not change that. We arrived at lunch time and started with lunch at ""The C"" restaurant almost next door on 750 Cannery Row. Very good restaurant with full view of the Pacific. Not bad. The kids got paper, quizzes and crayons and they where in heven even before we got into the Acquarium.I had bought tickets online so we just cruised by the long lineup to the ticket counter. Nice (smart move dad)!This is the third time visiting and the new part was the ""Seahorse"" pavillion. Amazing. They have seahorses from Australia which are hard to breed and cost between $35-40,000 each. They where absolutely beautiful to see (I'll post them on YouTube, just search for ""Australian Seahorses"").We'll be back!"
3619,2010-02-21,5,"I went to see the Sea Horse Exhibit and it was awesome. The Aquarium was one of the best I have seen. I recognized some movie scenes as I went through the museum. Awesome, awesome. A must see if you are in Monterey CA.PS Parking is horrible and expensive. So go early and find a free parking space."
3620,2014-07-04,5,My daughter did the Underwater Explorer's program where they let 8-13 year old kids go through a complete SCUBA experience in 4 feet of water.  The program was great.  The instructors were patient and amazing.  It was 1:1 instruction too.  Worth every penny of the $95 fee.
3621,2011-03-08,5,"One of my favorite museums since I was young. I can't say that too much has changed over the past decade, but I am throughly entertained every time. The aquarium has plenty of ohs and ah's for any age group. Spacious, decorous, and filled with various lifeforms to see! Also, the gift shop is a definite highlight."
3622,2011-11-12,4,"Had a blast although I thought it would be bigger.  Nonetheless, I'm sure I'll visit again."
3623,2014-04-30,5,"What a wonderful place. Just go see it yourself. Although we give it 5 stars, I'll do a bit of complaining here. It's sooo...crowded. Too many children's rides and cutsie attractions for kids..and too many digital type exhibits. They used to have more fish exhibits. Isn't that what it's all about? Well, now that I've gotten that out of the way, I must say we loved it. Hence the 5 stars."
3624,2013-07-23,3,"really like fish and was excited when I got some free tickets to go, the problem i had was that the place is kinda small and you can easily breeze through it in about half hr, I was lucky that i got free tickets but 2 of my friends i went with had to pay and i think it was like 40 bucks each for them, a bit steep for what i saw but i guess you can spend more time there and just watch the fish if you want to get your moneys worth."
3625,2011-06-02,5,"I have been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium many times over the years and I love this place. They have so many awesome exhibits and the tanks are beautiful. The secret life of the seahorse exhibit is so fun! The penguins are adorable. The tanks with the fish, jelly fish, kelp etc are so NEATO! It was a lot of fun playing with my camera and taking pics. Watching the sea otters was a lot of fun too. Overall I love everything about this place. I would recomend going as early as possible. It gets a little congested in the afternoon. If you are in Monterey dont miss out on this awesome aquarium!!!"
3626,2011-01-02,5,"I haven't been here since I was little, and it still looks great or even better! My hubby and I decided to take our 17-month old, and he loved it! Especially the touch pool area. He just kept wanting to stick his hands in the water. He loved the birds since we were up close to them, loved the otters, the fishes and of course the kids area!"
3627,2011-03-25,5,This is one awsome aquarium. Newly renovated. Many species of fish. The Jelly fish tanks were beautiful with calming music playing. It can actually be a therapy room it was so relaxing :)You can see otters and seal through the vast windows and on the decks.There are large hands on sections for children.There are many knowledgeable personel at the various areas to inform and assist you.
3628,2011-12-07,5,Wow!  I love all the large tanks.  I'm a scuba diver and the large aquariums appear just as if I was diving again.
3629,2014-08-17,4,"We take turns every year. One year our annual pass is to Monterrey Bay Aquarium and the next to the Steinhart Aquarium. We love them both. This year we decided to try out the underwater explorers. I was a bit concerned about the price. Turns out, the smile on my daughter's face, best $75 I've ever spent."
3630,2013-07-09,3,"I went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium today 07/09/2013 around 12:30pm.  Cons: THIS IS THE ONLY REASON IT'S MISSING THE TWO STARS.+ (BIG FAT HUGE CON)  This place was so intensely packed full of people that it was not fun at all.  First of all, it's dark.  So, as you're trying to look at the really beautiful fish behind the glass walls you also have to dodge five million people all while standing on your tippy toes and dodging and weaving just to catch a quick glance before the next bozo darts in front of you!  I am forcing myself to believe it's just the time of year because there is no way this place would have so many great reviews if it were always like it was today.  But the people man... I can't even express to you how packed this place was.  And the children weren't even the annoying ones... it was the adults with their cameras that stood in front of each attraction for five minutes at a time!!Pros: +BEAUTIFUL AQUARIUM.  And I mean breathtaking.  The displays are amazing.  It feels like you are IN the ocean.  It's almost creepy.  There are HUGE sea turtles and humungous tuna and hammerhead sharks in one enormous display and it's truly entrancing.  The sea horse exhibits are amazing.  The sea otter enclosure is really cute.  The JELLY FISH exhibit is beyond anything you could imagine and was the only part of the aquarium that wasn't packed which is beyond me because it was by far the most incredible exhibit there.+The staff is really friendly.  All of them.  Every single one we ran into was incredibly nice and eager to please.  They ask you where your from what you're excited to see. They make sure you get a schedule of feeding times and special events that are happening that day.+The animals look genuinely happy and the enclosures are clean.  The puffins play with you through the glass, the sea turtles are flirty and playful, all the fish are clean and active, and overall every single exhibit was so clean it was almost immaculate!Overall, I would not pay $31.50 (That's with student discount) to check this place out again.  No, I take that back.  I would pay that amount if it were guaranteed to not be packed like it was today."
3631,2014-06-14,5,I had a great day there. The animals were very entertaining. Make sure to see the sea otters. Don't bother seeing the feedings. It's is crowded. Just wait till that clears out and watch them then. The shows were good. I suggest seeing the sea otter show. Make sure you see the open sea feeding. It was very entertaining. Definitely worth it.
3632,2012-04-26,2,"Anyone who gives this more than 2 @ 1/2 stars needs to visit the Georgia Aquarium where you will experience at least a 4 star exhibit! Just because this place is located in an old sardine factory, which was really the coolest part, doesn't mean you have to pack people into it like sardines!  Not worth the admission fee."
3633,2011-07-12,4,"The 5 year old loved everything especially the baby sea turtles.  Watch the penguins get fed and you get a bonus sardine sighting...all the people around you. It's not for the claustrophobic.  The 19 month old loved the baby area with the round waterbed you can walk on,  the pick a duck area and giant shape sorter.  I loved the angelic jellyfish.  The cafe food is better than expected with a lot of healthy choices. The spinach salad was great. The minestrone was also good but bland. Forget the chocolate chip cookie...save the calories for something better."
3634,2013-07-22,4,Great aquarium.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Amazing exhibits.  Only 2 complaints: 1. Everything in and around the aquarium is outrageously overpriced 2.  Too crowded.  Just know these things before going.
3635,2007-03-26,5,"Coming from a little island in the pacific, I love anything that has to do with sea life and the beach. I enjoyed every minute, even though we had to fight the masses of hyperactive kids and their red-in-the-face, teeth gritting parents. Even with all kinds of things happening around me, it wasn't to hard to zone out and enjoy the exhibits. I found myself  ""lost"" in the Outer Bay exhibit(it was my lil' piece of heaven) and had to be pulled away. It was so calming to sit and watch the giant tuna, sharks, rays, and the strange looking sunfish swimming past. If I lived closer, i'd go there as much as I could. But I know for sure, I will be back!"
3636,2008-03-26,5,"If you are a CA native (hell, even if you're from Siberia) MBA is a MUST!   The Staff and people who volunteer/donate their time and money are so dedicated to making the aquarium a place where young and old can spend hours and hours there and learn non-stop.   The exibits always go further than any expectation I ever have, I almost dropped dead when they added the penguins (only problem with that is that its a little ""sea worldish"" )  everytime I'm there I can spend hours just sitting infront of the kelp forest or outer bay.  OH if only I lived there!!! P.S.  like any other aquarium/zoo the goodies you get from the gift shops are over priced for what they are(but so it everything else in Monterey- its a tourist town, what are you gonna do?)  plus there are like 4 or 5 gift shops,  but I have no problem seeing how most of not all the money goes to this awesome awesome place!!"
3637,2008-10-07,4,"I haven't been to this place since I was like 7.  Came here with two friends to check it out and we had a pretty good time.  Parking is a bish but 10 dollars for the whole day in a parking lot isn't so bad, just go down cannery row to shop/eat and it'll be more than worth it.Anyway, the place is quite large, two stories with a wide range of fish and shell fish as well as other mammals (otters ftw )  The jellyfish were fucking dope as shit, take pictures with it like everybody else does.  So what if you're not original, it looks cool.Otters are too fuckin adorable, liek seriously.  We saw an otter who kept banging the toy ball into the window AWWW!  If I were to do something like that people would think I am retarded, only otters can get away with it.The petting area was ok but very crowded.  I had to work very hard to touch the sting ray, those mother fuckers are smart.  If you try to reach towards them they immediately lift up a flap to dodge your hand.  My advice is to stick your hole arm in there, you'll be able to touch them (shit thats what I did) Do not fret, there are paper towels and hand sanitizer to your disposal.Overall, fun times (a little pricey 22.95 for student admission) and since cannery row is right there you should have a good time eating and shopping.  I probably won't come back for awhile seeing that its far as fuck from where I live but, I recommend that you check it out!"
3638,2008-12-08,4,"I have been going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium since I was a toddler.Fueled by my love for the ocean and animals, it was the perfect place for visiting. I've seen everything the aquarium has yet to offer.I've taken multiple Marine Biology classes in high school/college [I am a marine biology major] and thats taken me behind the scenes at the aquarium to see more animals, how it all works and meeting all the workers. I was even offered a husbandry job there.I've been tons of times when they've had the infant Great White Shark, saw her plenty and she's a shy one. People shouldn't expect her to come swimming up to their faces like the Mola Mola. That's just absurd.Though, coming lately, I feel that MBA needs to get modern or expand to include more aquariums. It's rather tiny, even though I enjoy myself all the time and can sit there for hours...if you go with friends who don't give a hoot about marine life, then you'll find yourself out the door in less than two hours.The location of the aquarium is beautiful, the animals are well taken care of. There are cute shops all up and down the street outside for a quick coffee fix or a shark shaped cookie.All in all, it's a must go.You have to take the children, but if you're going with a bunch of college friends/high school friends skip the 25 dollar admission and go to Santa Cruz beach or something.I hear Georgia's Aquarium has baby Whale Sharks and all."
3639,2009-01-28,5,"It's been about ten years since I've stepped foot into this place. Went here on Sunday, and I was pleasantly surprised with how much of my childhood was left intact. The staff was really nice, especially the ones that were handling the starfishes. SEA URCHIN FINGER HUGS! I have to say my favorites have changed. Back when I was a kid, I loved the otters. Now as an adult, I've fallen for the jellyfish. The cost was reasonable though my boyfriend commented that it's gone up since the last couple years."
3640,2009-03-16,4,"I had a lovely time at the aquarium though it got a little boring after a while. For those who don't take well to the sound of screaming children echoing through the halls, don't go on weekends. The jellyfish exhibit was quite impressive especially since ""Jellies: Living Art"" was around (I don't know if it still is).The admission prices are quite expensive but if you're going to be in Monterey for a while, you might as well get the year pass since after paying to be admitted twice, you pretty much could have paid for one."
3641,2009-07-29,5,"The BEST place to take the family if you have a membership and want a cool place to get the kids tired out.The aquarium is clean, there is a conveniently located/well-priced restaurant with good quality food, and the exhibits are thought provoking for all.I highly recommend it for people of all ages."
3642,2010-12-30,5,"Great place to spend a few hours. Can get a bit overcrowded by noon, but a little patience & snacks for the kids will help. Some highlights are the penguins, the sea otters, jellyfish, kids splash zone, and amazing tanks with sharks. The cafe was great too-crispy fries! Will be making this a yearly tradition for sure! Get there early-10am & buy tix through AAA!"
3643,2011-03-05,1,"I hate to be judgemental but who are we kidding....I am. I was bored here. Yes there are lovely fish and animals but why do I really want to look at those? I could watch the same thing on my computer screen at home. Yes, it was a fun day out but I wasn't that impressed. For little kids exploring or older people milling about I think it is a great place."
3644,2014-01-19,5,"Beautiful. I love this place. My son who's a year old had a blast looking at all the fish. The penguins are amazing.... Playing with you through the glass. Plus... If you have a little one, they have a cool play area for them to explore :)"
3645,2011-01-05,5,"I had a lot of fun when coming here with my girlfriend. Beautiful location and a great place for kids and adults. The great thing about this place is that it seems like it is neverending. There is so many parts and exhibits to explore that by the end of 4 hours we were still not done looking around. It was just a good place and if you want to take a break and get some food, it is right next to the main street of restaurants. I recommend to come with family or a date."
3646,2011-01-02,5,"The in-laws took us here while visiting for the holidays.  The sister-in-law, her grandmother, and the niece. The niece was very well behaved and really enjoyed all the exhibits.  I think my husband's and I's favorite exhibits were the jellyfish and the seahorses.  The kelp exhibit was pretty impressive as well.  I would have sat at one of the theatre style benches for hours on end just staring at the tank!  We ate at the restaurant in the aquarium and had an absolutely fabulous meal!  I would yelp seperately about he restaurant but I'm not sure what the name of it was."
3647,2011-06-26,2,"Such a disappointing trip. My husband and I took our children (4 & 20 mo) to Monterey Bay Aquarium with great expectations.  The website is a bit misleading with their animal guide. Most zoos/nature centers list the animals they HAVE.  The Open Sea exhibit was closed and we still paid full admission price.  I agree with another reveiwer that adults were sooo inconsiderate of their surroundings.  Pushing and bumping into children or other adults.  There's not a flow to the exhibits.I just don't know why people can't allow children up to the front to see.  On a positive note, the views of the bay are picturesque, the children's learning was great...just wish their were more animals!I guess when you've been to the AMAZING Georgia Aquarium you have high expectations!"
3648,2013-06-02,5,"Best aquarium in the U.S. and likely the world.  It is really fun, and the jellyfish and seahorse exhibits are surprisingly fun.  The adults were enjoying it as much as the children.  The museum incorporates some ""mod"" type fun in the jellyfish exhibit, with special lighting, computer interactive fun, etc.  And the seahorse exhibit was just . . . cool.  Of course, the sea otter feeding is ridiculously cute -- but it does get a bit crowded at the glassfront upstairs.  I'd definitely go during the week, not a weekend, and preferably not during peak visitor season if possible.   The ""behind the scenes tour"" is . . . probably not worth doing.  It's a lot of walking around in storage areas, but you don't see any animals (except an above water view looking into the shark tank, which isn't that great).  The guide will walk you in halls and show you videos on screens, show you shipping boxes they use to ship supplies and specimens with, nothing very special.  I'd skip it.  But the sea otter video is very worth doing (not very long, and very cute).  The penguin exhibit is pretty average, fairly small and just not terribly enticing.  But the seahorse and jellyfish, and sea otter sections make up for it.  The museum/aquarium overall is top notch -- and we've seen a lot of aquariums.  But it's not terribly interactive, and I'd love to see more sea life -- perhaps seals and sea lions to add to the facility."
3649,2011-02-23,1,I have now wasted my money twice.  The 1st time was about ten years ago and the other was today.  In 48 minutes I had seen all they had to offer.  I have been to the Shed Aquarium in Chicago and i was there for half a day and still had things I didn't get to see.  However the Monterey Bay Aquarium lacks exibits.  The JellyFish and the SeaHorses are the only in depth exibits.  Not ever gunna give it a 3rd try : (
3650,2010-12-30,5,"Made the trip down from the bay area with my family and in-laws.  I was told that it would be great, but it was much better than I expected.  The location is great, the exhibits are huge and the staff is friendly.  Absolutely loved it.  Strongly recommend purchasing the membership.  We plan to visit on a monthly basis."
3651,2011-06-17,5,"This place is amazing- I came here countless times when I was younger and every time it was like a new adventure.  I went to this aquarium probably once a year (at least) from when I was 6 to when I was 17, and every time I had an amazing experience.  Unlike some zoos and aquariums, you don't feel bad for the animals because their enclosures are so incredible (and most of them are rescued and wouldn't make it in the wild).  They talk about conservation and how to help protect the ocean at nearly every exhibit (not so much that it is annoying, they always make it interesting).  This is a truly AMAZING experience."
3652,2011-12-04,5,SO AMAZING to see the life or water animals and creatures. Spend the whole day here because the location is surrounded by a lot of local tourist like stores and restaurant.
3653,2010-10-05,5,Some ridiculously good looking people brought me here.  I should have been a marine biologist.
3654,2012-07-07,4,"I think that this aquarium is awesome. My favorite park is the Jelly Fish section. The aquarium also has an aviary, food court, plenty of gift shops, touch pool, penguin exhibit, kelp forest, sea otter tank, and various other exhibits and little stations on ocean conservations and educational things like that. The reason that I rate this aquarium 4 starts is that on summer weekends there are alot of people, I suggest that you go during a weekday, preferably a Wednesday. When there are a lot of people, you don't see any of the exhibits because there are so many people that are crowding around all of the windows, and then you end up paying $35 for nothing. An other reason why I'm rating 4 stars is because it is a long drive from San Francisco (especially if you are traveling with little children, because they eventually get bored of watching the dry grass and rolling hills), you can also get there by Airline Flight, or you could go to a small nearby airport and charter a flight there. It may be a little more expensive than a commercial airline flight, but you don't spend your time in long TSA lines at San Francisco International Airport (SFO).I suggest this aquarium for people of all ages, because they have exhibits for little children (such as the touch pool, and a brand new kiddie area where children can play with water and do other things) and they have more adult exhibits such as the Cannery Boilers that they have when you enter (I forgot to mention that they also have an exhibit on the Monterey Canning industry.).For children with disabilities, they also had a program where they suit up disabled children and carry them into the little lagoon in the back of the Aquarium where they can touch marine life and ""swim"" with other animals. This program is not only for Disabled kids, but for whoever wants to do it. I suggest calling the Aquarium to confirm that the program is still running and ask if you have to make reservations."
3655,2015-06-17,4,"great clam chowder, and of course a wonderful place to spend an afternoon...see the Jellies!"
3656,2011-07-11,4,Nice place my baby had a ball. i like the touch pond and there are lots of activities for the kids. over all had a great time. love the jelly fish
3657,2012-07-05,5,The Monterey Bay Aquarium is the best I have visited. 5 stars.The displays are exceptional and varied. All were outstanding.The Seahorse aquarium exhibit is  a delight.The jelly fish aquarium exhibit was fantastic.Good place for the  family and kids.Docents were enthusiastic and friendly.Cafeterias are available. I spent my time on the exhibits.Gift shops are available The place is clean and smoke free.I spent 4 fun filled hours at the aquarium.Cons follow.  Crowds fill the aquarium.                       Parking at the neat by City lot was $15                        Admission was pricey.Remedies. Go early in the morning.                   Park elsewhere and take the free trolley shuttle.                   Near by hotels might offer admission packages. Ask
3658,2011-07-26,3,"I know this is a wonderful aquarium, but when I got there and found out the price was $29 plus $15 to park, I just turned around and went home.This is  much more than other attractions I have been to in other cities."
3659,2014-07-02,5,"I love this aquarium! I'm a lover of museums, zoos, and aquariua, and this is the best of the best. The staff and volunteers are friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and passionate about the facility and its animals. This time I took my husband (44), our daughter (8), and my mother (67) along--I think they now love the place almost as much as I do!We visited on a weekend in late June, and by the time we arrived in mid-morning most of the behind-the-scenes tours and Underwater Explorers experiences (more on these below!) had sold out. If you're hoping for these, it's probably worth booking them in advance, which I understand is very easy to do by phone. Most of the behind-the-scenes tours are $15 per person if your group is all over 6 years old (they have other options for families with younger kids, but I don't remember the details; well described on their website, though).We purchased tickets in advance (as part of a SF CityPass), which saved waiting in the longish line to purchase them and made the per-person cost a bit lower.Although the hourly demonstrations, shows, and feedings are great, we opted to avoid them in search of smaller crowds. Every tank in the place is impressively maintained, with a variety of creatures that are well cared for and displayed, and we enjoyed taking our time to enjoy them! Signage is informative and interesting.We went on the behind-the-scenes Jellies tour, led by 15-year-volunteer Frank. He outfitted the group with headsets linked to his mic to ensure we'd be able to hear him throughout the 60-minute experience. We learned about jellyfish anatomy, reproduction, and life-cycle; got a guided tour through the jellies exhibit; went behind the scenes of the jellies exhibit to see how the animals are cared for; saw the water system from behind the scenes; watched biologists as they bred and cared for the moon jelly population; and touched a moon jelly. Worth every penny and minute! Amazing!One very minor downside is that the facility frowns on ""picnicking"" and would rather that you purchase and eat food from their onsite cafeteria. We were asked to leave for our lunch and re-enter, which was only a minor inconvenience--the cafeteria was crowded at lunchtime!My 8-year-old, a budding biologist, asked to experience the Underwater Explorer program in the facility's tidepool. Kids 8-13 can, for $95 dollars each, enroll in this 90-minute surface-scuba program. Space is limited, but we were lucky enough to get a spot in the last class of the day (4pm). The kids were given a quick scuba class; outfitted in sweatpants, jacket, a full dry suit, dive mask, vest, tank, and regulator; assigned two kids to a divemaster; and led into the frigid waters of the tidepool. Our kiddo, who is a string-bean of a kid, got VERY cold by the end of the experience, despite the warm and dry layers. She loved holding hermit crabs, seeing a monkey-faced eel, abalone, and sea stars, and the whole surface-diving experience. The entire staff of the program were great with kids, and it seemed every participant had a positive and memorable experience. Post-dive, the kids filled out dive logs that documented the wildlife, weather conditions, and equipment. With a complimentary hot chocolate as a warm-up, it was perfect. The kiddo now feels like an expert! Wonderful program!Give yourself lots of time to explore the aquarium, and you won't be sorry. We arrived at 10:30, left when they closed and kicked us out at 6:30, and wished we'd had even more time. The last hour of the day was the best for talking to the volunteers and enjoying the exhibits--the place emptied out and we felt like VIPs! :)"
3660,2011-12-23,5,OMG!!!!!! This is my Disney world! Great experience. EVERYTHING! Agh! I would live here if I could!
3661,2011-01-07,5,"The Aquarium is just a wonderful place to spend a day.  When could you ever see an actual school of Tuna?  I am bummed out that I missed the Great White Shark, but to be the only place to ever keep a few in captivity says a lot about the place.  If you visit Monterey, this is an absolute must."
3662,2011-07-11,3,"It's a cute aquarium and a must do if you are in Monterey Bay.  It has an one of a kind water filtration system allowing them to have unique exhibits that you can't find anywhere else in the world.  However, these exhibits are the sea weed/algae type, and not the stuff I get excited over, (like the otters.)  The rest of the aquarium is well kept and entertaining, but having grown up with multiple trips to the Balitimore aquarium, I can't get too excited due to the size."
3663,2007-09-16,4,"Here's what you should know before my review:I'm not an aquarium fanatic (I even had to look at the title to figure out how to spell it just now). I like them as much as the next person, but marine biology has never been my thing.Second, I've never actually paid the $25 or whatever it is to go to the aquarium (had to look again) because too many people around here have passes and stuff.Okay, on to the god stuff. I actually really like the MB Aquarium. I've been to a few major ones and it might be the best, however, it's the only major one I've been to as an adult, so who knows.There are lots of things to touch, so kids should be happy (as well as immature adults like myself).There are penguins and penguins are hella cool.Seems more often than not lately, they have baby Great White Sharks. Apparently there are good seasons for catching them. Kinda like deer hunting. In all seriousness though, being able to say, ""oh yeah, I've seen a few great whites in my life"" is pretty cool and not something most people can say (if they they do say it, probably weren't wanting to, or lived to tell it).I hate the fact that Otters are everywhere in Monterey. Otter this, Otter that. I thought an otter was another name for a beaver until I moved here. That being said, I have a new love for otters. The otter display is the most adorable thing ever. I don't find lots of things adorable, but this is. I think I've seen a few grown men cry.If you think seeing a great white is cool...wait til you see the tuna. Tuna is awesome. Chicken of the sea my a**. Try Elephant of the Sea.So yeah, I think it's probably worth the $25, but if you know any locals, ask them if they have passes. Heck, ask me. Definately a must see if you haven't seen it and are spending time in the area."
3664,2008-04-09,4,"I wish there were a 4.5 star option on this one. This place is truly one of a kind. 1. Beautiful location2. An incredible learning experienceAND1. Ever changing prices2. Screaming children3. I am not a huge fan of crowds, but I am not going to hold the aquarium responsible for the massive amounts of people, but take it from me: Avoid the hell out of this place and everywhere around it if you don't dig crowds. Go on a weekday in the fall or winter if possible, the most you will deal with our some field trips and a much smaller amount of tourists"
3665,2012-01-22,5,"Wonderful aquarium. Pricey but the exhibits are well worth it. It can be overwhelming for young children since there is so much to see. The relatively new Open Seas exhibit is pretty neat with sharks, tunas, sea turtles and more. The location is ideal, right along Cannery Row and Monterey Bay. When we visited, we watched wild sea otters playing in the bay outside. It can get crowded so go on weekdays when it's not as busy."
3666,2011-01-23,5,"Ive been to a few aquariums in different locations in the world, and I would say this is probably the best one I have ever been too.When you first arrive try not to be disheartened by the steep $30 entrance fee, try and plan in advance, and you may find a coupon online, we managed to get $2 off per ticket which i guess is better than nothing.We arrived 2.5 hours before closing, so had a bit of a whistle-stop tour of the aquarium, we saw most of the main exhibits, the otters and penguins are so cute :) Didnt get to watch any of the video presentations as we were pushed for time.I didnt go with children, but there seemed lots of things there that would be suitable for children - im sure they would all love the touch pools and being able to touch a real sting ray.I would definitely say you could easily spend 4-5 hours there and the views out to the Ocean are amazing.One other thing to remember is parking can also be expensive."
3667,2010-12-28,5,"Best. Aquarium. Evar!I was afraid I might get bored showing my tourist-ing relatives around, but this place was more awesome than I remembered as a kid.  I had multiple ""wow, I can't believe that is a real animal!"" moments.  The touch-pool, where you can feel a bunch of living kelp and sea creatures was great, too.  I had a lot of fun poking the sea cucumber, until it occurred to me that it might not enjoy the molestation quite as much.We spent about four hours walking around and could easily have spent a couple more if we caught more of the animal-feedings and any of the short films showing in the auditorium."
3668,2014-06-13,5,"I thought it would be much larger than it was, but in the end, the size was just right. The high price was well worth it considering how well maintained the facility is, how much attention to detail is put into the exhibits, and the expertise and effort that goes into caring for wildlife."
3669,2012-01-13,5,This is my favorite aquarium I have ever been to. It is huge! There are so many exhibits it takes all day to get through. Go on a weekday so it's not so crowded. It's a little on the expensive side but it's well worth it in my opinion. This is a fabulous family outing.
3670,2012-02-21,5,"I Love Love the Aquarium. We went on Sunday as a Family. It was a little crowded, but to be expected on a Holiday weekend. The kids had a great time. It is huge so worthwild....kids got tired. They also have a splash zone which is great for the little ones to run around in. The kids loved it , they didn't want to leave. We will be coming back. A great place to take the kids...we will be coming back."
3671,2010-12-01,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is such a beautiful space.  I was lucky enough to be able to go to an event that was planned here, so it was at night and the entire place was shut down except for admittance for our group.  It was an amazing experience to be able to go through and see all the beautiful marine life.  They have such a variety and I'm sure I could have spent an entire day just looking at all of the different species here.  They also have an area where you can feel different marine life and shells, which is great for both kids and curious adults.  I definitely think that a day spent here would be a great use of time, especially in the dreary weather that can sometimes dominate Northern Cali :)"
3672,2011-05-02,5,"My favorite place in all of california. Its educational, its beautiful, and they have otters, to me this is the greatest combination! I wouldn't eat here though the food is decent enough but its over priced! But thats how it is at pretty much any museum or aquarium."
3673,2014-06-07,5,"This place is Awesome! This is the only aquarium to hosts captive great white sharks in the world(not always on display). They have many big tanks and feedings for people to see the fish eat. There is a schedule with different shows and movies showing the research the aquarium has done. The staff is very knowledgeable and will answer any question you may have. This aquarium is very high tech with displays all around and a very interactive user face. definitively a must if you are in the area, well worth the price of admission."
3674,2011-02-28,4,"I don't recall ever going to any other Aquarium before but I've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium 2 times when I was younger and another time recently. A month or so ago, I finally came back with 2 of my friends and I was suprised of all the changes they've done. I can definitely say that you don't need to be a kid to appreciate the Aquarium. There is all these cool things for both the young and adult crowds. What's more cool about the Aquarium is that, all or most of their employees are actually volunteers, all of the admission tickets goes back to the Aquarium for the animal's food, supplies, and any other expenses the Aquarium might need to keep the place up & running. I think it's a wonderful place to go to. :)"
3675,2010-12-30,5,"I was not expecting to be overwhelmed, I mean, an aquarium is an aquarium right?   This place is awesome.   If you have kids and you are within 50 miles, it's worth a detour.   Clean, well run and great sea life displays.   I could sit and stare at the main aquarium (HUGE) for a day and not get bored."
3676,2014-05-28,3,pro: 1. cool2. interesting3. reasonably pricedcon:1. not fun when crowdedI went there once and I don't think it's worth to return. it's alright...
3677,2012-07-08,5,This aquarium is absolutely incredible! It's the best I've ever been to. I even bought passes so I can come back whenever I want. They recently got many more exhibits! Great for kids!
3678,2011-03-23,5,"I felt like a frikkin 10 year old again. And I am 32. I really had to contain my giddyness a few times. But this is the best. Seahorses, and feeding the stingray were highlights. We loved every minute of it. I loved the very nice political message too."
3679,2010-12-08,5,"this place is likely the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life.  the setting is surreal, the structure sublime (and very expensively remodeled i might add) and the exhibits are unequaled.  i can't focus on any one exhibit as all of them were wonderful.  the seahorses, the community tanks, the seals, the kelp forest....amazing.  anyone going to california and not seeing this attraction shouldn't waste their time going to californiaBUT....BUT.....BUT....the most amazing thing for me was the room with the jelly fish like thingies (sorry, forgot their name) upstairs.  the lights were subdued and each tank looked like a computer screensaver with bright blue water and the tentacles of this life form all intertwining as they swam up towards the light.  i could have spent hours in that 1-room alone just watching.....there are times i wish i had not quit being a stoney.  i can only imagine what being in that room would have been like if i was still experiencing the old 420.  anyway folks, go to this place.  if you have kids, don't go and not take them.  it's truly amazing and something they will remember all their life.  if you have the time to split the visit up into a couple of days, then by-all-means do so.  with the human attention span being what it is (especially with us guys), 2-days would allow you to take more in and remember it with more clarity.absolutely amazing place."
3680,2011-01-02,5,"I love aquariums. I have been to several in the US and Europe, and I think the Monterey Bay Aquarium is the best. Its exhibitions are amazing. And it's an excellent place for kids."
3681,2014-05-19,5,Great spot to kill a few hours in Monterey. The price of the ticket is a lot but make sure you buy your tickets in advance! You get to cut all lines and go right in! We enjoyed the Otter feedings and the Open Sea feedings were quite fun to watch. We also went directly to the Kelp areas when it opened so we could do the touch ponds before all the kids showed up. The aquarium exhibits on Jellyfish were spectacular and the Kelp tanks were very cool to see.
3682,2010-03-17,5,"This was my dream vacation. I live by the Oregon Coast and am an ocean child. This was beyond my dreams..... I took my son and husband. I took all of his senior pictures in the aquarium. It was like diving, touching, feeling and seeing all that the ocean can offer. I also subscribe to the Monterey Bay Aquarium newsletter so I can see their webcams. They are also heavy into ocean conservation and offer a wonderful seafood guide of what to eat/not eat. My goal is to go back for at least 2 weeks, it was so peaceful and relaxing. I can not stress enough how uber cool the MBA is!!!!!"
3683,2011-09-06,5,"Fabulous! Haven't been to an aquarium in years and was so happy that the innkeeper at Merritt House Inn suggested this place. We were able to easily walk from the Inn and it was a beautiful walk along the water and through Cannery Row. Spent at least 3 hours in the aquarium and probably could have stayed longer. Saw the new great white shark they just acquired, as well as everything else under the sun. There were some fascinating creatures and the place was very interactive and informative. There were guides all over the aquarium waiting to answer questions and tell you more about what you were seeing. Don't miss it!!"
3684,2011-09-02,4,"This place blows all other aquariums out of the water.  The views are spectacular, the exhibits are larger and more abundant, the guides are generally more knowledgeable and energetic, and the place is centrally located to great eateries and shopping.  Lines are long, but move quickly.  Chaos is organized here - it's a big tourist attraction.  I love this place."
3685,2013-12-11,3,The exhibits were great but the 35.00 fee is a bit much because the place isn't very big and you can walk through it in 90 Mins
3686,2013-12-11,5,"Loved the sea otters, gotta see them around feeding time"
3687,2012-05-08,5,"Amazing experience !!!! This is the second time that I have been there taking some out of town quests.  We purchased our tickets in advance and just entered the Aquarium without standing in any lines... yes, it was a week day during the time that school was in session, but still no lines and smaller crowds.  The facility was clean and there were several staff around to answer questions and they were especially helpful with one of our friends who has a physical handicap ... a must visit when on the Monterey penninsula ....."
3688,2011-04-14,5,"Woohoo! As good as it gets! is right. This is definitely a place to visit before you die.  The exhibits are larger than your average aquarium. Everyone packed full of knowledge about the biology inside.  I've been to MBARI, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, these people do great work to bring us this info. 5 effin' stars!"
3689,2008-01-21,3,"My wife and I drove two hours to Monterey so that our almost 3 year old could experience the Aquarium. It was great as usual, especially the otter feeding and the jellyfish exhibits. One negative was that the kelp lab was closed for renovations. This would have been the most fun and hands-on for her. If you go, and you have a little one, check for updates on closings/renovations."
3690,2008-08-31,4,"1-17-09:  Second time a the aquarium and we absolutely loved it once again.  Looking forward to the searhorse exhibits.  We watched the penguin feeding which was very cool!The kids looooooooooved the aquarium.  We think it was pretty cool too.  The jellyfish displays were our favorite.  This place is packed, but it's so huge that it's ok.  Bring snacks for the kids, because once inside the prices for snacks can be pricey."
3691,2008-12-09,4,"I love the jellyfish exhibitFYI:  The Monterey Bay Aquarium is offering Free Admission starting this weekend Saturday 12/6/08 to Sunday 12/14/08 for all Monterey County Residents. We just show them our driver's license as proof of residency, it seems to be an annual thing, but the week changes every year or whenever it's deemed a slow time....."
3692,2009-03-27,4,"Came here on Tuesday on a Spring Break. It was pretty crowded, but still okay. Tickets are pretty expensive for students like us, but yay, we found a $2 off coupon from the internet.visitcalifornia.com/medi…Anyway. Inside was awesome! The best best best aquarium I've ever seen. I wish I had come here when I was a kid. Love the jellyfish, and the sardines (or anchovies? I still can't tell) that go around and around a circle around you up above your head."
3693,2009-08-14,5,"With all of the reviews, I can't add much.  Just go here and check out the website for ""extras"".  My son is now 8 and ready to go to their dive program.  There is something for ages 1-101.BTW, get here when they open or on a weekday.  It is so crowded because it so awesome.  Or become a member to enter early.  I won't ding MBA for crowds."
3694,2009-11-17,5,"Great aquarium.Lousy restaurant so the stars are for the aquarium itself  The displays, the layout and the setting are absolutely the best! The Jelly exhibit has probably been burned into international conciousness by now. This is a must do place on the Monterey Peninsula whether you live here or visit. You will learn and you kids will be enthralled. But a big PS: Don't eat in the restaurant! It is  a busy busy  turnstile like place with industrial food quality. I think they save the good fish to feed in the aquarium.  Visit the aquarium for the exhibits then drive over the hill to Carmel and try Flaherty's for fresh non touristy seafood, then spend a few bucks at Tiffany's and go for a walk on the beach. A perfect day."
3695,2010-03-03,5,"This was my first time ever going to an Aquarium, boy was i happy when I got there. I was curious about everything I saw there. I saw red crabs and shrimp and sea horses, sharks and jelly fish. I was in awe of everything there. They have a hands on shell fish exhibit and you can touch different shell fish. I was very excited about all the fish. I highly recommend going here."
3696,2013-04-04,4,"First I'd like to start by saying that my wife and I are huge advocates for ocean conservation. We've been SCUBA diving and to aquariums all over the world. We'd read so much about this aquarium prior to our visit, so maybe we expected a little more. We truly appreciate the work they do and the message they're trying to get out there, so for that I give it 4 stars.      They have some amazing exhibits and are definitely interactive with kids. Maybe too much. At times I felt like I was at a daycare center with no supervision. I know that's not the staff's fault, it's the parent's. But where I have concern is when kids just start grabbing and poking at marine life in some of the hands ons exhibits. I know we want them to appreciate and not be afraid of what's in the ocean, but there has to be respect for it also. Not to mention, there are things in the ocean that are hazardous that they shouldn't feel comfortable just walking up and touching or picking it up. This is where the staff needs to educate and supervise the handling of the marine life exhibits better.     I don't want to sound negative about this place at all, but honest reviews can help for positive change. I would love for this place to be much bigger. There are so many great displays they had, but room to see them was difficult at times due to the large number of people the aquarium attracts. Some of these displays it would be very easy to sit and watch for hours because of some of the amazing animals they have there. They have done a great job with the habitats and lighting to get the full affect. This is something I've seen seriously lacking in other aquariums I've been to.     I'd love to see more ocean education out there and I know this place makes a great effort. I love that they have restaurant lists with ocean friendly businesses. It was really sad to walk down Fisherman's Wharf next to some of these same restaurants and see pictures taken at some of the ""tourist fishing"" businesses of dead sharks that were basically caught for fun. Those of you thrill seekers out there should grab a camera and learn to SCUBA. You have no idea how amazing it is to actually watch these magnificent creatures in their own environment.     Sorry for the soap box, please check this place out, it truly has some great things!!!"
3697,2012-06-18,4,"No, they dont have huge whales or sharks. It's not really possible to house those animals, so don't go there with that expectation. This is the kind of place where you could have a good experience or a boring one if you don't plan. You must go early, like around 9 am. Then you will actually get to see the big fish get fed, or see the penguins get fed. It's really cool. When we went we got to see a school of sardine fish get fed it was out of the movies. Truly amazing how they moved in unison like a big tornado in the water. The aquarium is pricey but thats the cost of keeping these amazing exhibits open. The jellyfish exhibit is awesome and unlike anything I've seen. The trip here is definitely worth it, check it out!"
3698,2011-10-20,2,Ummm this is more like a $15 aquarium than the $30 they charge but I guess it goes to a good cause preserving the marine wildlife. I was expecting more. If you've seen one very nice aquarium I suppose you've seen them all. Monterey and Carmel by the Sea are lovely but if this is your only destination...save your gas money and time.
3699,2011-12-28,5,"Assuming you can stomach the entry fee (or borrow someone's Guest Pass), you should visit the aquarium. Try and go when it is less crowded because the experience is so much more enjoyable when you can take your time at exhibits without jockeying for a good position."
3700,2012-04-10,5,"This place is amazing! It is small enough to see in a day but large and diverse enough to visit again and again. The movies and exhibits are always really informative and often spectacular. Especially for kids, it's a magical place!"
3701,2011-12-20,4,Nice place to visit at least  once. Great for kids too.
3702,2012-03-30,5,"Just came back from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, of which I'm a member.Today was the first day of ""The Jellies Experience"". Today was for members only, starting tomorrow it will be open for all guests.It was a fantastic, unique experience.Some of it is interactive!This place is very cool and really worth going, even if it is only for the jellies, but thereis a lot more than that; the Kelp Forest, the Open Bay ( one million gallon aquarium )  and many, many more unique exhibits!The web site is   montereybayaquarium.orgCheck it out !Oh !  The cafe and restaurant are also great, though a little pricy..."
3703,2011-08-17,5,"wonderful,fantastic,fascinating,very cool place.....what else is there to say..no other ,and i mean NO other aquarium can compare..!!!unless u go to the one in Paris, oceanography institute...."
3704,2012-01-22,5,"I LOOOOOOVE this place!  When I moved to CA a decade ago this was one of the first places I took a day trip too, fell in love with it then and am a member today.  I am an aquarium enthusiast and have been to many throughout the country and this is still my favorite.  Pros:Beautiful, fascinating exhibits.  There are several staples that they never change out that I enjoy visiting every time, but there are also new exhibits that are shared amongst a variety of aquariums that keep it interesting for new and old visitors alike.  (Their website always lists new things so you can check before going.)There's a good mix between informational displays and decor.  This place is well-organized, maintained and decorated so the entire experience is enjoyable and there's always something to look at.Fabulous children's section.  I'm a teacher and have taken students in elementary school all the way through middle school here.  ALL of them have loved the kids' section.  It's designed for the little guys, but interactive enough that the big kids are still drawn in even though they don't want to admit it.  =)  If you have a family with kids ranging in age you can always have an  older sibling ""help out"" the younger...trust me, they'll both have fun.There are a variety of touch pools and areas where you can get up close to animals.The walk-through slough section is a great nod to local ecosystems and unique.There are several outdoor areas you can check out with decks and binoculars.  You can even scuba in the one outdoor tide pool for an additional fee.The aquarium does a lot of bay-based research and rescue work, which means a lot to me.As a member there are many perks...times to visit when the aquarium is closed, special events and the ability to come in and out while skipping the lines.The food in the cafeteria is healthy, has a variety of options and tastes pretty good.  Cons:It does get crowded at peak times-weekends and during school breaks.  As a member this isn't that big of a deal (we go in a separate entrance and since we don't pay admission dropping in for a half an hour to see a new exhibit and then ducking out is fine.) but if you are a one time visitor this can be a pain.  My advice is to try to come on a weekday if you can, if not, come early and hit some of the big, more crowded exhibits first.  (Try to see the otters, whatever the newest traveling exhibit is, the octopus and the kelp forest tank early.)  Then you can circle back through to some of the smaller, lesser draws when it starts to get crowded.It's pricey.  I'm not going to lie, the admission is super high for a one day place.  When you add that to the cost of parking, this isn't someplace you want to go unless you enjoy aquariums because it's not inexpensive.It's huge.  This is a LARGE aquarium so plan to spend several hours if not the day here if you are only visiting once.  That means plan accordingly when parking or you will be running out feeding the meter constantly.  I'd recommend just parking in a lot or a garage.To me the pros greatly outweigh the cons and this aquarium is definitely worth a visit."
3705,2011-12-02,2,"I was a member last year and I do think it's a place you should go and see. They have good info of what seafood is safe and their conservation work is very important. With the free additional passes, I was able to bring my relatives who were visiting from out of town.  They enjoyed it very much. Tax-deduction was nice too. The reason for 2 stars:1) The membership/tickets are very expensive. 2) Parking cost money.3) It is such a far drive from Silicon Valley expecially after a long day. 4) NEVER go during ""community week"" which happens in December. I made the mistake of visiting the aquarium on that day and it was sooo crowded. The AC was lacking and was suffocating.5) The aquarium is too small. The sea horse exhibit has such a low ceiling that it is claustrophobic. 6) NO PLACE for nursing moms! I had to ""hide"" in the theatre and becuase of the stroller the attendent has hassling me. 7) Food at the cafeteria cost an arm and a leg.... unbelievable. Becuase of theses negative experiences, I will not be renewing my membership nor will I be going there for a while."
3706,2012-05-12,5,"I have been to this place several times. It was awesome to see the glass artwork based off of real sea life. The sea horse exhibit was amazing, seeing a variety of different types of sea horses. The recycling exhibit was amazing to learn and look at. It was cute to see the sea otters rolling around and relaxing in seaweed. It was cool to see sharks, the variety of jellyfish, octopi, and the variety of fish in the aquarium. It was cool to see how they use fresh water from the Pacific Ocean itself, and I was shocked at how this is one of the most unique aquariums on earth. It was amazing to see the variety of sea birds that were there.  It is sad that stores nearby are selling illegal products of seashells, because removing shells from the beach hurt wildlife populations and the food cycle. When it comes to listening to the scuba diver, that place can get really crowded, but it is a good experience to watch and listen to. The restuarant has great food for both meat and vegetarian eaters.The restaurant has you gaze at the Pacific Ocean. I enjoyed petting the sting rays, but don't pet their tail since that can hurt you. I loved petting the sea cucumbers and the sea anemones. Like the animal conservationists there, I hope that people will become more away and care about preserving wildlife and the future of this planet by eating more carefully, by recycling more, and by helping out more."
3707,2011-08-10,5,I love this place! Who doesn't?! I took my 9 month old here for his first time and he loved it. It's so visually stimulating got the little ones. My favorite is the sea horses. I'm so happy we bought the seasons passes because we've now I taken our son 4 times already in the last 6 months.
3708,2011-01-11,5,"I'm sure others have said it better so I'm going to keep this short: Monterey Bay Aquarium is awesome. The animals are diverse, there's a lot of information and work put into the exhibits, and the Monterey Bay is beautiful. Aquariums don't really get better than this."
3709,2011-01-05,4,"I was glad we were able to fit in a trip to the aquarium while in town. Course, this trip was during a private function, so we had the run of the place. It was a great venue for a catered event. Getting to see many of the exhibits while waiting in line to get food was an odd experience, but well worth it. The evening was very casual and relaxing. There were aquarium staff on hand to inform us of the various exhibits. It was really cool. Just wish the upstairs flamingo/sea horse/jelly fish exhibits were open. They were closed for refurbishment. That was the only down side to the trip. Can't wait to go back and see it again when everything is open."
3710,2011-11-19,5,Love this place. I had high expectations and I was still very impressed. The building is unique. The exhibits are unique. The employees are passionate. I recommend everyone goes here at least once. You won't be disappointed!
3711,2012-09-03,5,"I haven't been here in so long! I think it must have been at least 8 years since I've been here! Recently came here with my family! Hubby and I decided to take our kids here for the first time! Our children, 3 yrs. old and 9 months old, both enjoyed themselves thoroughly here! I love the newly remodeled and updated changes they made to this place! I felt like a kid again! I remember coming here as a kid with my class on field trips and also with my family! Brings back great memories and now I'm making new ones with my own kids! We came here on a beautiful, clear, and sunny day, same day as the old automobile auction convention thing going on in town. We had so much fun and they happened to have extended summer hours with free jazz concert and wine tasting (I believe not free, but I'm not so sure since I don't drink wine). My daughter is still talking about her aquarium trip to her preschool friends weeks after visiting Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
3712,2011-05-04,2,I had high expectations for this place -- to bad it didn't live up to my expectations. We came in after lunch and were immediately ushered in since we've already purchased our tickets online.   Our first stop was for the sea otter feeding.  We didn't know there was a mezzanine which provided a better view of the feeding.  Our next stop was the jellies gallery which was one of my favorites (along with the special exhibit on seahorses).  The splash zone and touch pools appealed more to families with children because it allowed them to play with water and touch some starfish.  The penguins looked dirty; the flamingos looked anemic.  The Kelp Forest was okay but I'm still not impressed.  Similar attractions in Hongkong and Singapore are way better.   I would not spend another $29 to return to this place...not unless I have kids (kids are easier to please!).
3713,2010-12-21,5,one of the best anywhere!
3714,2008-07-15,4,"Pros: two-story Outer Bay Tank, three-story Kelp Forest, Bat Ray Touching PoolCons: no piranhas, no sea turtles"
3715,2011-01-07,4,I really do enjoy going to this aquarium. It is clean and the staff is very friendly. I love the Outer Bay section it is amazing. I can be confusing to walk around and see everything but you do get a map upon entry. There is the Splash Zone for toddlers and younger children to check out but not much for tweens and teens there. Parking is probably the only pain you do have to park either on the metered streets or the parking garage a few blocks up. The other thing is it is pricey. All in all it is a fun place to go at least once a year.
3716,2013-05-06,5,"I love aquatic wildlife. I've been a swimmer for years and the water just calls to me. I love everything about it. My favorite animal is the penguin and they had them so I was extremely happy. You walk in and there are two huge floors with tanks and exibits to look at. Some are look, some are touch and some are interactive to help you learn about the habitats of various species and how it affects the world. How we can live harmoniously with our friends in the ocean. I signed up for text alerts so if anything cool happens around the aquarium I would know. So one alert was for feedings of the kelp forest tank and wild dolphins swimming outside the acquarium which was a rare treat. I really enjoyed the jellyfish and seahourse exibits. They have various fish and marine life and it's just really amazing all the wonders the sea has in store for us. It's a great place to go with children as long as you keep them in check. There were plenty of kids taking flash pictures when they weren't suppose to and touching the animals in the wrong ways and their parents just stood there doing nothing. Get it together. Even though I am 22 years old I still enjoyed this place too so don't think it's just for kids. Got a student discount which was nice as well so don't forget to show your student IDs."
3717,2013-01-22,5,"One of the coolest aquariums I've ever been to. I love it here. Only thing I don't like is the price. Since it's so high, I can only come once or twice a year especially since I live a few hours away. Beautiful, healthy animals and gorgeous views of the bay itself. Thinking about getting membership next year because I love it so much. Every friend I've ever brought here has loved it as well."
3718,2016-02-11,4,"This is a FANTASTIC aquarium. Lots to do and see. However, trying to find parking makes it a pure hassle. Drop your family off at the aquarium and then find parking. Be prepared to drive around forever, in horrible traffic, trying to find a place to park. You will pay to park and if you can't find a spot in any of the public lots (they are always completely full) be prepared and come with fists full of quarters. The street parking does not take credit cards and at something around $1.50/hour, it takes lots and lots and lots and lots of quarters. This is honestly such a disappointment in Monterey and prevents me from coming here much at all. With that said, plan to spend an entire day here at the aquarium. There are lots of things to see and touch for kids and for the adults, it is just as fascinating. We didn't find the videos they show to be worth the time really, spend your time exploring all the exhibits. Even if you don't have kids, this is something worth doing!"
3719,2011-09-06,5,Excellent place to go.The best aquarium I have ever visited. Informative and fun!Do not miss it.
3720,2011-08-01,5,"Such beautiful and fantastic creatures and scenes that it is imperative that one goes to this place at least once in his/her life time. Hard to describe it in words, so the best way is to see it for yourself."
3721,2012-01-28,5,"In my opinion, the best aquarium in the west coast.   Only downside is the entrance cost."
3722,2011-11-26,5,"Awesome!! Hands down best aquarium either my husband or I have been to...not that either of us has been to all that many...but still, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is pretty fantastic. It's huge, there is so much to see and experience, and they even have ""touching"" areas...where you get to feel the seaweed, starfish, crabs, even bat rays! Definitely go to the Open Sea Feeding...it is so impressive to watch all the various animals (tuna fish, dolphin fish, sardines, bonita fish, sea turtle and more) eat! Really, really cool, and plenty of seating and a two-story area so it's pretty easy to see. Many other shows (we only went to the sea otter feeding in addition to the open sea feeding) but I'm sure they were great as well. The seahorse exhibit is very tranquil and peaceful...it was actually my husband's second favorite of the whole place (behind the open sea area)! Really great. Helpful, friendly staff as well. Highly recommend this aquarium, for kids, families or adults (my husband and I are in our late 20s and we loved it!)"
3723,2011-08-29,5,"I came here on a Thursday and it was somewhat busy. First time visiting since I was a kid and this place never fails to amaze me. The layout is easy to follow and I like the interactive activities about ways to conserve the ocean. The mola mola left an impression on me. It is a must see! I loved the big tank minus all the flashes from cameras. I hope people discover the aquarium and/or no flash option on their cameras. The workers are friendly and this place is remarkable clean. Overall, awesome place for fish lovers."
3724,2015-11-19,5,"This is expensive aty $40 pp; however, my hotel had tickets for sale that were good for 2 days which was awesome (I'm sure most of the hotels do) because I am obsessed with the sea otters.   It was so wonderful to watch their feedings and enrichment time.   At least the price of admission goes to keep this amazing place running because it's obvious that they really care about the work that they do.   There were sea creatures here that I had never heard or seen before so it was really cool to experience.   They also have educational exhibits in the auditorium and lots of employees/volunteers around each exhibit to help educate and answer questions.   Like most tourist spots, the gift shop and food are pricey.    I spent most all of my time with the sea otters but also enjoyed seeing an octopus completely spread out and the jellies.   Most importantly a great reminder that however we can all keep our oceans clean, the better the chances we maintain our sea populations.   They had tons of education on this which is great for kids to understand about sustainable seafood and protecting the environment/oceans."
3725,2007-06-10,4,"Monterey Bay Aquarium is a cool place that I first went to as a kid and i like the fact that they are right off the Pacific Coastline and they can give everyone the animals that exist in the Pacific Ocean.  There is a huge glass aquarium that you can see tons of sharks, fish, starfish, etc.Check this website to see it is about and how the prices are:mbayaq.org/efc/efc_otter…Good luck and I hope that if you take the kid's you bring a few extra dollars for the things that want to get to remember their trip there.Good luck.  This will be a trip your family should remember for life.God Bless you, your family and friend's."
3726,2009-11-10,3,"When you hear about aquariums and you're not really a marine aquatic major something in college...it doesn't really excite you when you are going on a trip like this one. But to be there is something different. I didn't expect that seeing schools of fish right in front of me would leave me in amazement. My fiance was beside me staring at me when he noticed i was frozen in amazement with my mouth open.,seriously I wasn't expecting a reaction like that as well. Giant aquariums with fishes,corals right there before your eyes moving is like..wow. you have to really be there, its much better in reality than just words! The 2nd floor of the building is for kids,lots of activities for them to keep entertained and they wouldn't think that this trip is a bore."
3727,2010-09-07,4,SO its been years wince I had been to the aquarium that I frequented in my youth. And I have to say It is still in good shape. The sea life is well represented and the habitats are clean. The staff is helpful and not pushy at all. Admission isn't exactly cheap but its not ridiculous either. I personally don't really like seeing wildlife in captivity and after a while it started to wear on me. You do see a lot of beautiful things here though anthe penguins with name tags...ACH!!! SO CUTE! wish ther was more otter action but we got wild otter action the next day so I was sated.
3728,2013-07-14,5,"This place is fun! Plenty of fun interactive activities, beautiful jellyfish and seahorse exhibits and other amazing displays of marine life. It can get pretty crowded so I would recommend buying the tickets online, which saves quite a line at the entrance."
3729,2011-09-28,5,"If you have kids, this is the place to take them during the spring and summer.   The kids love the place. They have many marine exhibits.  There is also an educational touch tide pool for the kids to actually feel the marine living creatures.  The weather is always great in monterey."
3730,2011-05-08,2,"Everyone we talked to said this place was great and well worth it.  When we walked in, we turned to each other and hoped it would get better. It is unimpressive. The aquariums are small, not enough sharks. Too many people taking millions of pictures of everything. The sea horse exhibit and the fishing practices exhibit were interesting. The fish in all the aquariums are pretty much the same room after room. There are like three areas to touch animals, but they are all the same animals. For the quality of the museum, it is way over priced. If you have kids who have never been to an aquarium before, it would be good. If you've been to any other aquarium, it is same old. The Baltimore and Camden aquariums are far superior. We were very disappointed. I added a star because of the view of the bay from inside the aquarium."
3731,2014-02-26,2,"An earnest attempt at a world class aquarium, but very small and lacking overall. The price is exorbitant and not at all worth it. Your money is going toward gourmet meals for the otters--noble maybe, but 80 bucks later that means this couple had cup ramen for dinner."
3732,2011-08-16,5,"The displays are great, the people are nice, the views are amazing, and the sea otters are the cutest things in the whole world! Loveeee this place! I wish I lived closer so I could volunteer here! Way better than the Long Beach Aquarium!"
3733,2014-01-12,5,"If you are ever in the area, you must visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  Don't pass on the opportunity to visit the very best aquarium around."
3734,2011-05-02,4,"We went last weekend, after not seeing this place for over five years.  I would say I could spend an hour maybe two hours here at most.  I loved the Penguins and the Seahorse exhibit.  I think next time I decide to try this place out, will be during the week, when it's a little less crowded.  People are always over your back breathing on you at every exhibit."
3735,2012-08-11,5,loved it here been several times! love the touch pools and how you can interact with sea erchants and star fish. the aquariums are gorgeous with hundreds if not thousands of fish to look at! beach birds in the sand walking around its just a great experience and its right off the pier so you can enjoy monterey and the aquarium. recommend it to everyone!
3736,2008-03-03,5,"i wanted to be a marine biologist when i was younger. alas, it was never meant to be. is it weird that now, im less interested in studying the creatures in these exhibts, but rather eating them? i swear i was getting hella hungry walking through the exhibts.dude, live spot prawns, you cant find them this time of year. skate wings? come on and the blue fin tuna!??!?!?one of the many highlights during this visit, a volunteer trying to explain seafood watch to a couple of japanese tourists. umm yeah. good luck with that."
3737,2015-10-30,5,"Beautiful aquarium with a emphasis on local flora and fauna of the Monterey area.  Sea otters were my definite favorite altho I didn't get a good viewing spot at the window for feeding time.  We were able to watch the feedings of the otters, at the kelp forest and the deep ocean.  The narrators and docents were all friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable.  If I lived nearby, I would definitely want to volunteer here.  Another thing I really liked is, they (narrators and docents) don't try to give you any BS about the biology and animals of the area, unlike other (ahem) ""amusement parks"" that will tell you orcas only live 20-25 years in the wild or that their dorsal fins ""are always folded over like that"".  Bull.  Kudos to Monterey Bay for being honest and straightforward, especially to the little kids when it comes to telling them about Nature...  We had lunch in the cafeteria; my friend had a hummus sandwich and soup and said it was good.  I had their hamburger and fry combo and it was hot and tasty!  The giftshops had some beautiful items and we bought a couple of items to take home.  It was nice to visit in the middle of the week because it wasn't crowded at all and I hope to return soon as it was relaxing to just ""be a kid"" and enjoy all that the Aquarium had to offer.  What made it especially nice was, during the rest of our trip, while we were driving through Pacific Grove and also visiting Point Lobos, we could reflect back on what we saw/learned and apply it to offshore from where we were hiking.  Looking forward to my next trip, hopefully soon!"
3738,2013-12-30,3,"The facility is beautiful with many exhibits and different animals to see. The biggest problem we had was how many people were in attendance. We visited on a Sunday so we expected a crowd. However, there were so many people that it makes everything worse. It was hard to find a table for lunch. It was hard to actually look at the exhibits."
3739,2010-09-13,5,"I went for the first time in my recent memory here and I had such an amazing time. I don't understand what people are griping about when they complain about such an amazing aquarium... are you expecting to see new amazing unheard of animals? A blue whale in a tank? Seriously, people.Even though we came during Labor Day weekend, we were still able to get a good look at most of the exhibits and maneuver around the huge throngs of young families. I was so surprised by the huge variety that they had. I also loved how they were able to integrate interactive activities and exhibits for the kids so seamlessly into the entire aquarium... what a learning experience... even for me!My favorites of the visit:-sea turtles!! My first time seeing them :D-otters. They don't do much, but they're so adorable.-bat ray petting area, barring the teenagers that stood there for 15 minutes and hogged all the space ):-sea horse & jellyfish exhibit-kelp forest-pretty much everything else.The admission price is a little steep, but I'm okay with paying it knowing it goes to the good cause of maintaining the exhibits plus further research. There are slight discounts available to students and also AAA (you can buy these at the AAA office and avoid the lines at the aquarium).Parking at the lot is also pricey, but if you keep driving down along the scenic trail to around 1st Ave./where it turns residential, there's free all day parking! Win (:"
3740,2008-03-26,5,"This is so completely a 5 star aquarium.  I love the Seattle Aquarium, which has grown over the years from a feisty little place to a large one, but this is the Gold Standard.  We arrived at 9:30 this morning and there was still a crowd waiting to get in at the Members' door.  Once in we headed for the remodeled Splash Zone w/ its newly enlarged penguin habitat.  We've been bringing our granddaughter every year since she was 6.  At that point she was impressed that she was a member because we were.  Now, at 11, she's too cool to be impressed.  But she loves it here.  And she's old enough that we can let her wander at her own pace w/o worry she'll get lost or frightened, so we all wander independently, reuniting frequently to check in as Alan and I always do.  Every time we visit we find new exhibits they've added.  This time they had several new types of jellyfish and feathered sea dragons, very cool cousins of seahorses.  The Chihuly glass at the entrance to the jellies was wonderful as always.  The otter exhibit was cool.  The kelp forest had its own school of anchovies which was new and wonderful as we watched them move together.  The anchovies in their own circular container seemed less numerous, probably because the ""herd"" had been thinned to send the other school to the kelp forest.  The Outer Bay exhibit continued to mesmerize.  I didn't see any sun fish, though.  The gift shop was walled off in the front where an empty brakeless bus had smacked into it Monday, fortunately missing the lines of people outside and customers inside.  Must have given the workers some PTSD, though.  We left after a couple of hours for lunch and then a trip to Asilomar Beach, where granddaughter could spend some beach time.  We'll return to the aquarium later to finish off what we didn't see this morning."
3741,2014-02-02,1,"very small aquarium, and not many things to see. extremely overpriced!!! compare to Atlanta aquarium  that was much cheaper. And in Atlanta aquarium we saw different sharks, rays, dolphins, beluga whale, otters, piranhas, etc. It was huge and really AWESOME!!  In Monterey aquarium - nothing interesting. But maybe it's awesome for people who have anything to compare with. Do not understand what to pay $40 for! I was very disappointed. I'd bette spend my money in different aquarium. Do not recommend. Find different aquarium in LA or SF and enjoy."
3742,2010-06-27,5,"Sea horses in the most exotic patterns and differentiation, sea and ocean conservation info, sardines swimming in one direction while the others are going the opposite way, jelly fish, kids staring at the glassy eyed fish in the aquariums, touch and feel ocean area (living kelp and starfish). Did not want to eat seafood after this exhibition (however, we had clam chowder the previous day)."
3743,2011-05-15,2,"I was a little disappointed by the aquarium. I would have liked to see a lot more fishes and sealife.  The seahorses exhibit was good, and its unfortunate that the jelly fishes were under construction - I was really looking forwards to seeing them.  I will go back when its open and will update...."
3744,2012-07-30,1,"Simply over rated. I was not impressed or amused. It's really a place for kids. Did it once and now I can tell my future grand children: Been there, done that! Save your monies for ice cream and candy and college and skip the aquarium!"
3745,2011-06-17,5,"Probably the best aquarium in the NorCal area ! Way bigger than the aquarium in sf ! It's best to come here on weekdays, not as crowded. They have sea otters, a lot of different kinds of jellyfish, hammerhead sharks, tortoise, just a whole bunch of fishes and even birds ! And you get to touch some ray fishes and starfish , deff worth the money"
3746,2010-11-28,5,The otters are the best.  Make sure you look for corporate discount from your employer.  Arrive before noon to beat the crowds.  Aquarium is always worth the visit.
3747,2013-06-15,5,"We stayed all day! The special exhibits on seahorses and jellyfish were incredible. Couldn't get near the otters, but every other area was accessible. The views from various observation decks were just as fantastic as the aquarium itself. The deep ocean tank was phenomenal. Clean, we'll kept and a great flow through the exhibits. I had so much fun!"
3748,2010-08-18,4,I love sea life but am against animals in captivity. However this place does act as a sanctuary and they take pretty good care of their hostages.
3749,2013-12-16,3,Way to expensive for admission and did not have but all around very interesting place to visit if you have kids
3750,2009-08-05,3,"do not go during the summertime! i repete, do not go during the summertime! the sea horses will still be there in the fall.also, i swear they've raised their prices. $28? are you for real?yes, the sea horses were cool. $28 cool? i don't know....."
3751,2013-07-10,4,"I visited the Aquarium on a Sunday mid-morning.  It was pretty pricey for what you get ($34.95 for adult).  I thought going on a Sunday (June 30) would be less crowded, boy was I wrong.  I had to wait behind people at most of the exhibits until they moved so I could see anything.  While the aquarium had some great programing, great exhibits, and friendly staff it will probably not be on my to-do list any time soon when I return.  I spent 3-4 hours there, I was at one point bored because I had to wait to see pretty much everything.  I've been to several aquariums.  This wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst.  It is worth at least one visit. The gift shops inside are also quite pricey, although you can find something for at least under $10 if need be.   I imagine if I was a member I would probably enjoy it more because I could come and go as I pleased, whereas at $34.95 a ticket, you want to get as much as you can out of it during the visit.  I should also mention that the aquarium doesn't have parking, so you have to pay to park basically anywhere.  It costs upwards of anywhere from $10-$20 to park in any lot near the aquarium."
3752,2009-07-14,3,"Admittedly, I'm not much of a fan for the mysteries of sea life. However, this is certainly the best aquarium I have been to. The location is terrific. Exhibits are great to read of, look at, and even feel! Moreover, the staff are very helpful in answering questions. On my visit, I did not encounter much of a crowd.The Monterey Bay Bay Aquarium is a must see if visiting its surrounding area. However, for $29.95 per person -- I feel that its admission price is a bit excessive (hence, a lower rating).If you have children, I am almost certain that they will enjoy what this aquarium has to offer."
3753,2009-02-16,2,"Judging by the vast amount of 5-star reviews, mine will probably not be popular.  However - I am quite confident that the review is shared by some.First - the price!  We have visited many aquariums throughout the U.S. and even Vancouver.  I do not recall paying nearly $30 per adult (and this is with a AAA discount).  I'm a biologist and my wife an animal-lover who had never been; so - the price was paid, thinking ""at this price, it shouldn't be overcrowded""....Second - Overcrowded!  If anybody thinks we're in a recession, go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and see the hundreds of people paying $30 a pop.  It was not even feeding time and one had to fight to get close enough to see the exhibits.Third - not ""Adult"" friendly.  It should be made very clear that this aquarium is geared toward children.  If you have children, you will love this place.  If you are two adults looking for something new and exiting in marine biology - pass.Overall - much better experiences at other Aquariums for less admission price."
3754,2005-12-22,5,"This is the coolest aquarium ever!  Its huge and has lots of neat sealife.  Much of it hands-on and interactive, and all of it educational, the aquarium is divided into several exhibit areas based on the Bay's various natural ecosystems.  Don't miss the fascinating Outer Bay exhibit: too bad they don't have the bizarre sunfish anymore, but you may be surprised to see how big, strong and fast tuna actually are, even the one with a big bite chomped out of his belly (native sharks were removed from this exhibit only after they had discovered that everything in the Outer Bay tank was edible, including the sushi-grade ahi)."
3755,2013-09-15,4,"We liked this place.  Lot's to see and yet all can be done within a 3 hour span.  Cookies at the snack bar were great!  A bit on the expensive side, if you have triple A you can save $2 bucks per ticket (for the cookies).  Discounted tickets can only be bought at triple A offices - there is one in Monterey."
3756,2011-09-11,4,I really loved this aquarium. My only complaint was the out of control screaming kids jumping on the railing... But that's what to expect when you're around a bunch of different families.Minus all the crazy kids it was a great experience! Next time I go though I will be planning this trip in the middle of the week.
3757,2011-09-11,5,"This aquarium is so awesome! The tanks are so thoughtfully put together, and they have a White Shark pup! The Kelp Forest displays are HUGE and they make you feel like you are diving in the actual kelp forest (with much better visability, I'm sure). There are so many diverse species of fish and ecosystems on display- I spent over 4 hours there by myself! I cannot wait to come back!"
3758,2013-09-08,5,Fantastic experience. Very interactive with so much to see and do. We were worn out after only a few hours.  Food at the Cafe was great.  Fantastic facility - wish we lived close by. We'd be members for sure!
3759,2011-07-22,5,Love love love this aquarium. The best one in all of America in my opinion!!! I grew up coming here...no other aquarium has ever compared. I adore the jellyfish! Can't wait to come back!
3760,2010-10-25,2,Great place for children. But extremely overpriced for what it has to offer. The highlight is the sea otters. other than that its an elaborate fish store.
3761,2009-03-24,4,I have tried to come on a Tuesday at 11 = packed.  Sundays shortly before close = packed When is it not packed?  Even though the students on field trips remind you why birth control was invented this place can be fun.  I loved my entire day here even though not all of the exhibits were open.  I love coming here and take advantage of the discounts for tickets whenever possible.
3762,2010-03-10,4,Absolutely beautiful exhibits here. I think I could have gazed at the fish swimming by me in all those tanks for days. But the pushy little children with their sticky sugar fingers took me out of all my trances. I expected as much at an aquarium. Lots of kids pushing past you to get a closer look while tired parents try to keep a constant eye on their young while stealing a few glimpses at the marine life themselves. Tuning the little monsters out is easy enough though. They have some really nice interactive things for children to partake in and plenty to look at. Everything I saw here was breathtaking and not long enough. The $30 admission fee is a bit of a shocker. I've been to plenty of state fairs and museums with more for less money. But it was worth the drive and the experience.
3763,2010-01-16,5,"I remember fondly coming here as a kid, and now I was able to bring my own daughter!   The ""Splash Zone"" by far was my daughter's favorite part.  There are tanks mixed in with a kiddie playground theme...oh and don't forget the penguins!  The adults particularly enjoyed the seahorse exhibit...so many different varieties to see.  It's a great way to spend the day and well worth the drive.  I'd recommend visiting on a weekday (we went on a Friday) to avoid the crowds."
3764,2011-07-13,4,"Great place to visit time to time.  The jellyfish exhibit is much better than when I saw it several years ago, very good lighting.  The seahorse exhibit has expanded a lot and they have a couple of really large tanks now.  One thing that might be nice would be some crowd control.  It gets pretty crowded inside with kids and strollers, maybe they could limit the amount of people in at any one time so as to create a better experience for everyone.  The price of about $30 per adult is pretty steep too."
3765,2009-04-16,1,Horrible place for Toddlers! The bars in front of many exhibits are just the right height to block my son's vision. The aggressive crowds makes me worry about the safety of my child and the space hogs certainly don't bother to make room for a toddler. Their web site says that strollers are okay but actually close to half the place tells you to park the stroller outside the exhibit. Why not tell us ahead of time so we would not bring it?
3766,2006-09-19,5,Very nice aquarium.  Well designed.  Worth a visit.  I've been there many times.  Yeah... the jelly fish display is trance-like.
3767,2007-02-02,5,"I'm pouncing on the can o'worms Kelly E. just opened.  I love the Monterey Bay Aquariaum with frightening fervor.Otters?  OMG yes.  I want an otter.  A few really, so they don't get lonely.  I only wish they weren't all sleepy and lazy when I saw them - I wanted frolick!More jellyfish than I thought possible; delicate and fragile and deadly all at once?  Hella.And seriously the rays?  Such teases!  In the tank where you're allowed to touch them, they glide past, making you reeeeeaaaach to touch them.  Every once in a while they come close enough to taunt you with their softness.  I think they're hoping you'll fall in.  Silly rays.The bounty and knowledge here is amazing.Add to this the fact that you can rent it out for parties (which we did) and wow.  I might ask them to refrain from the little ""dinner show"" of throwing a live but morbidly wounded fish into the tank to spark a feeding frenzy however.  That bummed out everyone that had ordered the fish for dinner.  And even most of us that ordered the chicken.  Yowza.Of course they got the shark the week AFTER I was there, damnit.  He would've eaten the hell out of that fish and not left it all chewed on at the bottom."
3768,2011-03-16,4,"We had a great time here today. The price to get in is still super expensive, but I love all of the new features. The last time I visited was the same as the time before with many years between. This time it was totally different. They have added so much more for the little kids to do. Wish my kids were smaller so they would enjoy all the interactive exhibits. We had fun touching the sea life and viewing all of the creatures. Great job giving this place a fresh look and making it more fun for the kids."
3769,2011-08-21,3,"As expected, this Aquarium is an amazing place with a great exhibits--they are both educational and also really help bring out the wonder and magic of the sea. There are kids everywhere, of course, which is to be expected--who wouldn't want to bring their child to this place? I really don't understand the one-star reviewers who go to this place and complain about it having too many kids. Seriously, what gives?The biggest drawback of the MBA aquarium is its price. When I say this, I am not complaining about the price from a personal level, because even though it cost quite a bit--$80 for myself, my fiancee, and her 6 year-old nephew--the bottom line is that we have the means to afford it, and I don't mind helping support such a great place.But what about all of the other Bay Area families who can't afford it? For a family of four, a day's admission is $100 (two adults and two children 3-12), not including making the drive out of Monterey, parking, food, etc. When I think about the thousands of local families who can't afford such an expensive day-trip, and the thousands of children who are missing out on the aquarium as a result, it makes me sad. As an organization dedicated to raising awareness of marine life and protecting the seas, I would hope the MBA would have discounted admissions, or provide some other way to encourage families of all income levels a way to enjoy this place.It's a beautiful place, but it seems a bit sad that only foreign tourists and middle to upper-income families are able to enjoy it."
3770,2011-10-20,5,"Loved it! We spent several hours here, got to see several feedings and presentations. Staff was friendly, exhibits were beautiful."
3771,2013-06-28,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is an awesome place to visit for both locals and out of town folks!  The customer service is outstanding and the housing for the aquatic/marine life is the best!  They also rotate the sea life, so they don't spend their entire lives in an aquarium.  The Aquarium emphasizes environmentally friendly practices such as eating sustainable fish and even have a wonderful handout for you to take with you listing the fish that are fine to eat, and those that are overfished and better to avoid.  They also have a handy Apple app on this.  My favorite exhibits were the seahorse and the jellyfish, as well as the sea otter and jelliefish shows.  We spent about 4 hours there on a Friday afternoon, and there were not large crowds plus it was a gorgeous day to be in Monterey.  It is situated in the heart of Monterey, near Cannery Row.  We were able to park on the street about a dollar an hour.  There were change machines nearby to get quarters.  THere was also ALL DAY parking for $10.  Be careful to pay as we did see one car that did not pay being towed away!  There are lots of restaurants close to the Aquarium and there is a restaurant inside, though we did not eat there so cannot comment.  There are MANY good restaurants nearby, so it is very convenient whether you eat there or not.  We did get a membership as there are five of us in our family.  Students do not need an ID to get the student discount, though it is highly recommended to bring it.  We will definitely go back, and it is well worth the drive if you are coming from out of town!  I highly recommend this delightful attraction in Monterey!!"
3772,2009-08-08,1,It was packed! Not worth it when they jam hundreds of people in here. They should limit how many people can enter.
3773,2013-08-14,5,"This is education at it's best!  It is the perfect blend of informative museum and marine life collection.  It is a must do for families with children, or for anyone who loves the sea!"
3774,2008-09-29,5,"I love this place! Loved it as a child and now I absolutely love bringing my daughter here. An educational and fun-filled trip for all ages! You literally can spend hours gazing at all of the different exhibits. I've been here multiple times and I swear, I see something new every time.They recently opened the new splash zone which is way better than I had expected from what their website noted. Tons of hands on activities for infants, toddlers and adults. There's a great interactive area where kids can create waves, tide pools, and wet areas where the kiddies can throw on smocks and splash around. They even have an indoor play area with a under the sea theme where kids can get dressed up as their favorite sea creatures and bounce around in. I highly recommend to make it there early so you can catch all of the feedings. My favorite is the kelp forest, sea otter and outer bay feedings. Bring your digital and video camera..there's so much to see! Such an easy going family atmosphere. What's great is the little ones walk away learning so much while they have hours of fun. Buying the membership is worth it. Plus you feel like you're doing your part in supporting the Monterey Bay research :)"
3775,2008-01-20,4,"Great place to take the family on weekends.  I've been here so many times; we scheduled our mommy dates here, lol.  We had the opportunity to see the Great White Shark during the short time they had it.  The Otter Exhibit was the children's favorite.  Also, you don't have to visit the Aquarium to see seals and walruses because they would just sun bathe on the beach and rocks.  When you're bored of the Aquarium you can walk Cannery Row, oh so fun and check out the Thai restaurant across the street... oh so delicious!"
3776,2014-09-08,2,"We just took a family trip to the aquarium and were so excited to show our 2 year old and 3 month old this place that my husband and I grew up visiting and loving. We even bought memberships for our family and my mother in-law. The aquarium was great with beautiful exhibits, great interactive displays and natural beauty. However, I did have one major negative interaction with an employee. As we wandered through the jellyfish experience exhibit my 3 month old got hungry. I found a secluded, dark corner, sat down and began to nurse him. Within seconds an employee walked near me and said, ""We have bathrooms for that."" I couldn't believe I heard him correctly so asked him to repeat it. When he did I laughed and said, ""I can legally nurse here and in any public space. You cannot ask me to cover up or leave."" He replied that he was in the exhibit to find me and ask me to cover up because other people were complaining. I knew that was impossible as I had just sat down when he approached me. I told him to go look it up and that he was grossly misinformed. He walked away saying he would check into it. I have never had this experience anywhere let alone such a family friendly place and was so put off by this ignorance that it brought my whole experience down. That is the only reason I gave it 2 instead of 5 stars. The Monterey bay aquarium should educate its staff before they find themselves in the media and/or in legal trouble over something like this."
3777,2011-03-26,4,"Fish, Fish, and more Fish......... I am a local and this a place to bring the kids, or people out of town, and the occasional date. Not worth going over and over unless you have a thing for fish. I just prefer eating them over watching them. Only neg would be price of food in cafe. Your better off finding something on the street that not over priced and will you filled up."
3778,2008-02-26,5,loved the underground shows of sea life and the jellyfish shows. parking was so so a few years ago. it's probably very bad now.
3779,2009-08-20,4,"this aquarium is AMAZING.  it is the total package: educational, beautiful, and always FUN.  both grown ups and children can enjoy their time here.  grown ups can amuse themselves by looking at the diaphanous JELLYFISH and the current SEAHORSE exhibit [i prefered the jellyfish exhibit, but the seahorse one is just as interesting].  children can have fun in the SPLASH ZONE or just anywhere in the kids section, [adults too! because i seriously still got a kick when i saw DORY AND NEMO (the clown fish and... the purpley blue fish... from finding nemo hehe)].that being said, however, i must confess: while i do love this aquarium, but i do not love the little kiddies putting their wee hand prints on the glass.  the smudges ruin the fish ogling experience.  yes, the kids are cute, but i don't really like running into little kidders every which way... don't even get me started on the stroller frenzy!  toes can definitely be compromised at the more popular exhibitions.FYI: if you're a student, you can get a 2 for $90 membership package, and you can go to the aquarium more often during the year.  you save $$ too with this package, cause if you pay full price every time you go, it adds up!"
3780,2011-11-11,5,We never visit Monterey without visiting the aquarium! Always a good time. The wife and I come alone but we have the most fun bringing the grandkiddies. I wish I could give them 100 stars!
3781,2005-05-10,5,"I think the world would be a better place if we swapped cats for otters.  Everyone who has a cat would turn it in, and in return they would get an otter and a small, rocky tidal pool to house it. Otters are far more entertaining than cats and I think they may be smarter and they are certainly more industrious. Then all the cats could go back to that strange planet they are from.  They don't even like us and you can't tell me they're from earth.  I don't trust'em, I'm telling you."
3782,2008-09-25,5,"I love sea creatures, really I do, and would quickly trade places with Dori or Nemo in a heartbeat.  Do you remember those fun little coloring contests from like 1st and 2nd grade that required you to create your own ""under the sea"" creation, replete with plenty of starfish, sea horses, dolphins, crabs, seaweed, coral, anenomes, urchins, slugs, sharks, you name it.  Those were my favorite coloring contests of all time and I always tried really hard to be a winner, but I guess I could never truly compete with the kids whose parents really drew the creatures for them because let's be real, no 1st or 2nd grader can create an ""under the sea"" picture as good as the winners.  C'mon judges, get with the program!  Oh, the injustice!Then, when I was in 5th grade, we had to do an Oceanography Contract, involving a plethora of assignments dealing with sea creatures and oceanography subject matter.  Students who earned a ""C"" or better got to go on a special field to Anacapa Island and see these wonderful sea creatures and oceanography subject matters up close and personal.  Of course, I got an ""A+"", being the studious, conscientious, retentive student that I was and relished in all of the splendor, fascination and discovery of our trip to Anacapa Island.   I was truly in 10 year old heaven!So now, fast forward 13 years later and you can surely imagine the childlike fervor that bubbled up inside me when I found out my coworkers and I were headed to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for our ""team day"".  Ohhhhh YES!!!  Since I can't breathe underwater, my mermaid friend, Ariel, said the Monterey Bay Aquarium was the next best thing to trying to be a part of her world.While at the aquarium, we hit up every exhibit, witnessing some eye-watering hilarity while at it.  The first tummy tickling sight was in the Splash Zone at the Penguin Exhibit, where the funniest, hunky-dory music was playing in the background and seemed to go in tandem with the quirkiness of the penguins.  Just watching a penguin walk is funny, so watching a penguin walk in rhythm to the music is pure comedy.  That was just the beginning.  We happened upon the Penguin Exhibit shortly before feeding time and saw the madness that ensued with that.  Holy goodness, the penguins all erupted into a seemingly synchronized hopping, squawking frenzy, as they expectantly waited for their fish.  Now remember we've still got the funny music playing in the background, so with the penguins hopping and swaying in unison with it and squawking from all their excitement, we couldn't help but to become doubled over from laughter.Moving on to the Sea Otter Exhibit, some more funny business took place, those sea otters being the tricky, sneaky, playful creatures they are.  So there were several buckets, large enough to accommodate the lounging, sunbathing otters.  While a few of the otters were straight chillin' like villains up in those buckets, one of the otters was polishing his pirouettes in the water, and putting on a show for the spectators.  Apparently he got bored, and mischievous because he suddenly slithered up out of the water and snuck up behind one of the other otters in the bucket.  When he got close enough, he tipped the otter out of the bucket causing him to fall in the water.  We started dying of laughter.  Then the otter who fell in the water got mad or wanted revenge and the two otters engaged in a pushing and slapping war for a while.  Ultimate Fighting for Otters . . . sweet!We seriously could have left after seing just the Penguin and Otter Exhibits as we were thoroughly bemused from all the funny biznass.  But no, we hit up the mezmerizing Jellyfish Exhibit, viewed the sharks and stingrays, the giant sea turtles, the octopuses, the Sandy Shores Exhibit, and the Rocky Shores Exhibit, where we had fun in the wave tunnel.  We were awed by the wonderment of life under the sea, feeling like kids again, and found the Monterey Bay Aquarium a wonderful and fulfilling experience.  If you haven't been, go.  If you can't go to Monterey Bay's, go to an aquarium that's more local.  You'll be in for a fascinating adventure.We ended our sea excursion by patronizing one of the many giftshops lining the streets lead to the aquarium and came away with more than enough delicious salt-water taffy to last a lifetime.  Okay, not a lifetime, but a long time.  There are also an assortment of seafood restaurants to keep with the theme of everything sea-related.So for $24.95, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is the place to be, ""Under the Sea."""
3783,2012-01-11,5,"It doesn't get any better than this.  Located in a steampunk enthusiast's wet dream known as Cannery Row, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is simply the best aquarium in the U.S.  Countless engaging exhibits featuring sea life you'd never imagine out on the U.S. plains.  My son, who can't yet speak or pay much attention to anything for more than a minute, was absolutely captivated by the prancing penguins, the swirling swarms of sardines, the gracefully gliding sharks and the otherworldly glow of the jellyfish.  Yes, the admission is expensive, but it is absolutely worth it.  You can't have an exhibit this spectacular without generating some revenue.  Yes, it can get very crowd.  But despite my hatred of large crowds, I didn't seem to mind in the aquarium and my fellow patrons were quite polite.  Since I have family in California, I will probably find myself here once every two years.  If you like aquariums, you must visit this place before you die."
3784,2009-06-14,5,"Wow, I always heard great reviews about this place, but since i'm from SD, and we have the Birch Aquarium, I never even considered coming here.  But this weekend was my niece's bday and we went up north to go camping and came here and it was 100x better then the Birch Aquarium in San Diego.  It was by far the best Aquarium I have been to.  There are so many different exhibits and so many things for people young and old to do.  Plus it is situated right over the ocean where they offer scuba classes.  Prices can be steep ($30), but students receive $2 off.  But if you haven't been here before, it's definitely worth your money.  There was this one exhibit that I could sit in front of and just watch the sharks and fish swim all day.  It was a large window in a dark room with a blue backdrop.  I forget what it is called, but I loved it.  The whole aquarium was beautiful!"
3785,2011-05-29,2,"Two stars only. The biggest disappointment for me was quite personal, though. I will still share it on Yelp, because I do believe it is outrageous.1. Very poor exhibition. The only species to see are penguins, flamingo, otters, jelly and several other fish. There is nothing to do there more than 1 hour. I absolutely agree with one of the earlier reviews: San Francisco aquarium had somehow left more positive impression on me, even though it does not have the same animals.2. $30 is way too expensive for this amount.3. There is no sufficient parking.  3. And the last point which, like I mentioned above, is very personal, but which made me dislike the whole idea of the mission that the Aquarium is advertising they follow. We left the aquarium close to 6pm. Soon after my son remembered he needed a bathroom. You know, with kids it is always the last minute. We ran back to the Aquarium and tried to enter. Apparently it was already almost 6pm, and the crew member ran to us with a question how she could help us. I said we needed a bathroom for my son. She replied that bathrooms are already closed and we needed to go straight out on the street and then left to find public restrooms. Because I saw quite a few people still in the museum, I started to insist that all we need is a quick bathroom use, only for a child, that we had just left the museum where we spent 2 hours in the crowd, paid $30/person, bought souvenirs, and thus deserve to have a right to use a bathroom. She would not let us in. I burst out and mentioned that this was the first time of my life in the US that a child would be refused a bathroom. And the lady replied: ""Ok"". Ok???? This completely disgusted me. I said it was not ok and ensured I would write a letter to the museum management expressing my dissatisfaction. She immediately said she would invite a manager herself, and started to call for one. While the manager was coming, another party of 4 people with 2 women and 2 kids came looking for the bathroom. The girl gave them the same direction to go to the public restrooms. Those people were much more patient than me and started to modestly beg her to let them into the restrooms because they would not be able to carry everything that far. Eventually the manager came. I told her all I wanted was possibility for my son to use a bathroom. The manager right away let him in, and in 2 minutes we were out of there. My question is: even if the crew member followed the letter of the rules, was she right to treat us this way? If the mission of the Aquarium is to help the ocean, and their constant task is motivating people to make an extra step to support or sponsor the ocean, then why does the Aquarium consider it not necessary to make an extra step to let people use their bathroom once it is 6pm? Like I said before, this is the first time that I would see someone refuse a restroom for a child. It was so low and disappointing."
3786,2011-05-29,4,"Had a great time, next time I definitely will not come on a holiday weekend.  It was too over crowded."
3787,2011-09-13,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium was awesome. Currently they have a baby great white shark on exhibit. He is a little guy, but still really cool to see nonetheless. The puffins, penguins and jellyfish exhibits are really neat. The entire Seahorse exhibit is pretty cool, they have a large variety of seahorses. They also have a sea otters and an interesting octopus. They offer little shows whether it be informational or at feeding time. These only last 15 minutes or less and a really fun to watch. I definitely recommend going during the week. We got there first thing (10 am opening) on a Tuesday and it was still relatively busy. I wouldn't want to see this place on a weekend. All in all, it's a really cool place :)"
3788,2009-02-24,2,"First off, I build and fix custom aquariums as a consulting job on the side, and I charge next to nothing because marine life is my biggest passion!  I've been to other aquariums, and I think Monterey Bay Aquarium was a disappointment for me... especially since it's so hyped up.I visited this past Sunday, and brought a date.  We didn't realize that half of the place is geared toward children.  Also, the ticket price is very high.  The place is so big, you'd think there's a lot to see, but the exhibits are very spread out, and there isn't much variety.The biggest disappointment for me was that the majority of exhibits are for marine life that's native to Nor Cal... cold water.  Not that I don't like that type of marine life... I just wanted to see more tropical species... Indonesian/Caribbean/South Pacific...It only took us about 1.5 hours to see everything, and we saw many exhibits multiple times.  I think it should take longer for $30.I'll stick to Birch Aquarium in San Diego for now."
3789,2010-12-29,4,A lot better than Seattle's Aquarium. Good for dates.
3790,2011-07-07,4,Very nice place to go with the loved one or kids. I went on 4th july weekend and maaan was it packed. It was hectic so couldnt spend to much taking pictures next to views. But other then that a rrally nice place to spend time the only thing that sucks it doesnt have a aquarium tunnel. Price is 30 bucks per person :/ sucks if your taking the whole family lol
3791,2011-05-16,2,"The exhibits are small and unrealistic. The flamingos are in a small room with only a few plants. The penguins are also in a small room with a little area to swim in. Most of the aquarium is plastered with videos and plaques to read, with tons of posters threatening acid rain and climate change. If you want to see the same animals (penguins, otters, flamingos, fish, tide pools) in a more natural habitat, any zoo has it. It took about an hour to get through it all, even with reading everything on the walls. I will however give it credit for their seahorse exhibit."
3792,2010-05-31,5,"Sea Otters and Pink Flamingos are awesome... overall, a very high quality attraction!"
3793,2007-06-06,5,"i love the view on the observatory deck overlooking the tide pool... its gorgeous at sunset... its just another reminder that we are not the only creatures in this world, and that there is so much more out there that we do not know...there are odd photo ops around here EVERYWHERE!  cannery row is just down the street... then there is the ocean right there - and a nice beach to pack a picnic for if you are up for it... fish tanks magnified by 1,000,000x's filled with sea creatures you never even knew existed... dark and intimate observatory areas for intimate conversations and stolen kisses if on a date, also perfect for promoting healthy peeping-tom behavior amongst children and fish."
3794,2008-05-20,5,"wow.i love this place.i love how you can pet the adorable bat rays.i love this place so much.the jellyfish always send me into silence for a good twenty minutes.i love the sharks. sharks are fascinating to me.i'm not to thrilled with the otters, to tell the truth.but i love the kelp forest exhibit.and the jellyfish.oh, and the octopus is great too.but i kept on going back to the bat rays.cute little bat rays....awwwwwwwww....*this is not a reaction to the otters. this is a reaction to the bat rays.*: D"
3795,2008-05-21,5,"This is an amazing place for both kids and adults.  I can't wait to bring little ones here and have them go nuts over fish and sharks and the tide pool.  I love it, how could they not.  My favorite of all time is the jelly fish though.  I can stand in front of that tank for hours.  The only downside to this place (if it could be called that) is the food court. Severely overpriced and poor quality. I don't come here for the food though and there tons of great food options nearby."
3796,2010-10-26,5,"very much like the birch aquarium except on a larger scale.  the otters get all the attention because they're so dang cute but i also liked all the jellies, the baby sea turtles, seahorse and of course petting the rays was great.  oh yeah when you get there sign up for the text update because it gives you feeding times that are not listed on the events.  here's a $2 off coupon - will work with student discount too so remember to bring your ID.visitcalifornia.com/medi…"
3797,2008-02-16,5,id like to be under the sea in an octopus garden in the shade my aquarium favorites not in any particular order- touch tank sea cucumber-. the outer bay jelly exhibit and circling sardine- mola mola aka sun fish- BLOODY MARYS!!!!!!!  i like mine extra spicy
3798,2011-08-21,5,"5 stars. Definitely. I have yet to give a 5 star until this review.MBA is perfect. The place is huge. Enormous. It'd take an entire day to get through this place and see every exhibit. I loved the section with the birds. I loved that place. There are some interactive exhibits (ones with the stars and sponges).Had so much fun here. 6/5 stars for kids.5 stars won't even do this place justice. It's just magnificent. If you live in NorCal, a must-see destination. Who doesn't love this place?I'd be stating the obvious if i said this place had a ""lot of fish"". Heh.GO if you haven't already. Worth the time definitely."
3799,2010-03-06,2,"I've been to a lot of aquariums and truthfully, the design is at least 12 years old. Have they ever heard of a renovation? Where is the whale shark? Seahorses were kinda lame, seriously half of them are smaller than my hand! The otters were cool... until they fell asleep.  Would have been cool to have some other options for food, its not worth looking at these things if there is nothing to eat. But, I will say that they had a nice collection of kelp. Im not sure any other aquarium in the world has a more extensive kelp exhibit, they gained an extra star for that. All in all, it was a good outing to take my stepdaughter Frances to."
3800,2010-04-28,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  We are members because we are such fans (also, member line is shorter - hello!).  I also like that not only is this a cool, interesting, educational place to go, but they also do tons of research and help with preserving the ocean, saving captured sharks, etc.  If you are a parent, this is must to take your children to, to help they develop a love/respect of the ocean and its inhabitants."
3801,2007-06-10,5,"I love this place!  Not only are there childhood memories here, there are adult ones as well.  I've always wanted to be the diver that goes down into the kelp reef tank to feed all the fish!  But fantasies aside...Dont miss:-The sea otters.  They are adorable and when not sleeping, really ham it up.-The gigantic tuna...there used to be waaaaay more, I went about a week ago and many had been replaced with smaller (read: more boring) fish.  -The Ocean Sunfish (also in the tuna tank).  It's sooooo COOL! en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im… ---- It's like a huge fish that got sat on or something! I think I stood there for 45 mins looking at it in awe. -The penguins.  Last time I went they were fighting and um...doing the nasty. Silly birds.-The touch pools, normally....  I almost cried in anger last time though.  This bratty (oh, I mean *adorable*) little boy was ripping the starfish from the sides and then dropping them back into the water.  It was so packed that the overseer guy never saw him.  My mouth was agape in horror while the boy's grandmother just smiled and looked on.  I walked away wishing the starfish had teeth.-Don't forget to go outside to the observation areas to look for wild otters and seals!I miss it already...can't wait to go back!"
3802,2012-05-17,4,"I remember going to the aquarium when it first opened and paying around $8 or so to get in. It's almost $30 per person now which is why they didn't get 5 stars. lol  It's always crowded, and understandably so (cause it's pretty cool!) but it would be nice to be able to see the exhibits once in a while without hoards of idiot tourists snapping pictures with the flash on ( DO YOU NOT READ THE SIGNS? NO FLASH DUMMY!!!! IT SCARES THE FISH AND THAT""S WHY YOUR PICTURES DON'T TURN OUT!!!) or kids that climb over the railings to smack the side of the glass and scare the fish. This isn't an aquarium problem - just a bad parent / stupid person problem. Anyhow, I still love going. It's relaxing and if it gets too crowded, you can head outside and sit in the bleachers and look at the ocean. My advice would be to go first thing in the morning on a weekday. You'll be done by the time it starts to get really packed. Don't eat at the restaurants inside. They are very over-priced, food is mediocre. Monterey, being a tourist location, will have that problem (high cost) all over though. If you want to see any if the feedings, show up 20 minutes early to grab a seat and don't be shocked when a troop of kids stands in front of you to block your view!! If you do go early, there's a pay parking lot a little up the street from the entrance to the aquarium. It'll save you from any meter parking and it'll save you a super long walk. You just have to park fairly early - and don't worry - you'll get enough exercise walking through the aquarium because it is huge and there's lots to see. Plan on at least 3 hours if you're just walking normally and not really stopping for long periods of time. Also - if you have small kids, please control them to not ruin the experience of everybody else who paid to relax as well. Karma will reward you.   :)"
3803,2010-12-28,4,Took the family here today and we had a blast. Everything about this place is cool.The kids love it and my daughter got some great pics for her class. It's great to be able to see what's going on below us when we're in the water.
3804,2010-06-17,4,"I love this place! My toddler just kept saying ""No waaay!"" & ""WOW!"" the entire time we were there. He was mesmerized. I remember feeling that way as a kid visiting this place. It is worth it to spend a half day here. The kid area upstairs was perfect for my lil guy & his friend. He really adored the tidal wave & danced around every time he saw it. Admission is expensive, but that comes with the territory. It is not something we do often, so it was a real treat."
3805,2007-10-21,3,"fairly good, but considering the location and all i would've expected a bigger scale and more marine life variety."
3806,2011-05-31,5,"The.  Best.Check out, in particular, the wave pool.  Designed by David Packard himself.Bring your kids, your grandparents, your college friends...yeah it's cool."
3807,2010-03-22,5,"What a great place!  My husband and I spent a good 2 1/2 hours here on Sunday, and we probably could have spent longer if we'd had the time. :)   I was especially impressed by the detail of the exhibits -- the coastal wetlands exhibit and the Secret Lives of Seahorses exhibit were my favorites."
3808,2009-09-13,5,"I FOUND NEMO!!!!!!I felt like I was searching for Nemo while roaming Monterey Bay Aquarium. I was petrified when Bruce (white shark) and I came face to face with each other. If it wasn't for the thick glass wall, I would've been lunch! I was able to learn about the different creatures that live in the deep blue sea that I never heard of before. The secret lives of sea horses was outstanding. I never knew there were so many different types of sea horses! This is a must place to visit if you are ever in Monterey."
3809,2010-08-01,5,Awesome experience. Definite must see if you are in the area.  Give your self 2-3 hours to look around.  If you are with children you might need to double that time estimate.
3810,2009-02-22,5,I visit here at least once every year because a relative of mine lives within walking distance [: All of the exhibits are fun and beautiful and definitely worth a visit! Get a members pass if you're in the area often because there's always something new to see.
3811,2012-03-19,5,"I love coming to this aquarium.  Being that I am a Monterey County resident has been a great advantage as well.  Every December, there is a week when the aquarium is free to Monterey Residents.  All is needed is a photo I.D. or some other proof that your residence is in Monterey County.  Also, on usually the first day of each month except in the summer, the county free libraries have a limited amount of free passes to the aquarium.  The person requesting the pass has to be a Monterey resident but the pass is good for up to six people the rest of your guests do not need to be Monterey residents.  It is a great opportunity to get in free, especially since the day admission is expensive at about $30 per adult.  I know the admission fee goes to a good cause, but free is still great.  Anyhow, the aquarium is well organized and the various amount of sea creatures are truly a thing to see.  Being a former marine biology major, I truly appreciate this place and what the staff has been doing to better educate the general public when it comes to oceanic awareness. I would recommend that any tourist that comes to Monterey visit this aquarium.  It is a real treat to experience!"
3812,2007-04-30,5,"This place was great.  On my favorite aquariums of all time list they place # 2.  Love the lay out, the kid friendly stations, the jelly fish, the big fish, the sea otters, the tide pool, the hanging whale.  I pretty much loved it all.  Also, had a lot of informative stuff explaining different things I didn't know.  Most of all I love the fact I didn't have to wait in line to get in."
3813,2010-06-08,4,"The sunfish is gone! Aw, man, I waited all day in hopes that it would return from a small vacation or something but all hope is lost. I think it's dead.New flamingo exhibit wasn't bad... seems like they're trying to push all that global warming stuff into the minds of children, not that I care. Cool big-ass albatross they had though. I also found out that the penguins have names!Bought a tiny octopus from the gift shop. Lots of stuff were on sale. If I'd known earlier, I would've brought the bank and taken everything.Also meant to ask if jellyfish procreating was fun... sure seems to be a lot of them. Didn't have the guts to do so, though. Boyfriend also tried to pull my shirt up in an attempt to ""flash"" the octopus, if you know what I mean."
3814,2006-12-04,5,Grew up at the aquarium and I haven't been in over 5 years.  I have dishonored.  This place doubles as a hot spot to throw sic parties.
3815,2010-02-15,5,"I've visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium as a kid, but it's been a realllly long time since I've been here and I'm really glad I got a chance to go again last Friday (and thank goodness I had a day off when most everyone else was at work!). Although I expected to stay for longer, the whole aquarium only took about 2 1/2 hours to explore. My favorite was ""The Secret Lives of Seahorses"". I didn't know there were so many different kinds of seahorses (some are tiny!). I was very intrigued by the video of the male seahorse giving birth - how come our species can't have the males giving birth?! :P I also really liked seeing all the jellyfish and watching them move about in the water. This is a place worth coming back to from time to time to reaffirm appreciation for aquatic life."
3816,2011-01-04,4,"I was comparing this Aquarium to the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. Probably not a fair comparison, I realize that, but Monterey Bay Aquarium held its own. I liked the surrounding area along Cannery Row with nice shops to browse. There are many nice outdoor decks that are over the ocean that are great to take a breather from the crowds. I was disappointed because one of the exhibits was closed for upgrades and the place was SO unbelievably packed we had to fight to see anything. They really should limit the number of people in so that it is a better experience for all. I would go back, on a non busy day to really enjoy the exhibits."
3817,2007-04-14,5,I used to scuba dive in Monterey when my body could actually do beach diving and stand the cold. I absolutely love this place. My hat's off to Lucille Packard and what she did to create a venue where people and sea creatures could be together on dry land. I had a pass when I came here a bunch for diving and it was well worth it. The pass gets you around the crowd crush at a separate entrance. My mermaid photo was taken here. Now I get to borrow the pass that our Monterey office has for group use.
3818,2007-07-25,5,"I love this place.  My favorites are of course, the otters.  And the new river otter exhibit is terrific.  The river otters are smaller than the sea otters, and just as adorable.  The jellyfish exhibits are amazingly beautiful.  I never get tired of coming here, there is always something new to see."
3819,2013-07-07,5,"Kids loved it.  One of the best.  Great jellyfish exhibit.  For our family of five, we chose to become members for $195 (tax deductible) and go multiple days.  For lunch, we went to the Carl's Jr a block away one day and deli sandwiches from the Nobb Hill Food Market a block away another day.  My kids would have liked a third partial day as well.  If we had another day, we might do the aquarium and then the mini-golf or mirror maze down the street."
3820,2011-01-01,5,More fascinating than I expected even with the hype.  I loved the octopus and sea horse exhibits.
3821,2010-09-04,5,"This is the BEST aquarium that you will be spoiled by their exhibits. There are so much to see! Seriously.  It will amaze and impress you that you can not compare other aquariums to it. And unfortunately, your expectations will not be the same anymore. The entrance fee is a little pricey, but it is worth it. When you do visit this aquarium, I recommend taking your time and see every exhibit they have to offer."
3822,2007-02-05,5,I can't even fault them for the high ticket price because it's so worth it.  The aquarium was first built for the tourists but it was really all about the locals falling in love with it.  Memberships are totally worth it and especially for families with kids.  I remember the jelly fish exhibit being the most amazing thing I've ever seen.  It's not just a giant glorified fish tank.  It's a Monterey institution.  This is the only place you should put on your list when visiting Monterey.  Parking is a bitch so go early to find a space and bring a roll of quarters.
3823,2009-05-27,5,"Exactly everything everyone else said.For all ages, this place is a wonder.  It has so much to offer -- it's magical, educational, and so tranquil.This is something I recommend everyone come to at least once in their life.  It's one of the finest things California has to offer.Some tips:1.  Buy tickets online before you come.  The ticket line can often take awhile and that's annoying to deal with when all you want to do is go inside!2.  Come early!  Nearby parking fills up quickly, so be one of the first to arrive so you don't have to deal with that mess.  Or, be willing to walk a bit (really not too far at all) if you come later (and park further away).  Also, parking isn't expensive, but it also isn't cheap, so be prepared for that.3.  You can spend literally anywhere from 2.5 hours to at least 5-6 hours in this place.  Come with people who have a similar interest-level so you don't have to feel rushed, or conversely, so you don't have to feel like you're slowing everyone down.4.  If you are coming from a distance and are worried about what to do after, this is located right near a plethora of shopping, restaurants, and etc. to occupy yourself with for the rest of the day.5.  Look up the Daily Activities schedule before you go so you can plan it out just right.Basically, gogogogogogogogogooo!  You will not regret it!"
3824,2013-06-29,5,A great aquarium! I would plan to commit an entire day to it. We only spent 1/2 day and felt rushed. Take in a couple of short auditorium shows. And take a break for lunch on Cannery Row. Awesome jellyfish exhibit.
3825,2011-08-10,5,I just love the many exhibits of ocean related animals that are here.
3826,2011-06-26,4,"I was passing through Monterey on a roadtrip and almost didn't go because I figured if you've seen one aquarium you've seen them all- plus, it was $29.95 with only a $2 discount for students. I would have been very sorry. This aquarium has the best display of jelly fish and seahorses I have ever seen. My two favorite sea animals. I cried reading the display of the courting seahorses and watching them dance together as soothing music played in the background. It was so intimate and romantic, I could have stayed there all day.I also appreciated how many of the displays addressed global warming, the dangers of over fishing, and buying seashells. While my teen daughter and her friend explored the reef displays I went outside and enjoyed a sunny Monterey late afternoon on the deck.  They have benches that overlook the Pacific and free telescope style binoculars to peek at ocean creatures in their natural habitat. I was rewarded with spying one lone seal.  Allow yourself 2-3 hours to fully enjoy this wonderful aquarium."
3827,2010-09-19,4,We drove 2 hrs for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I had read on yelp that there are definitely cheaper places to park and we were looking into parking at the Downtown East Garage ($7 for all day) but it would have been another mile we would have had to walk to get to the aquarium. So we had no choice but to park at the Cannery Row Garage which after the first free hour charges you $1.50 per half hour. We had bought our tickets online for the college student price of $27.95 which is still pretty steep. For some reason I expected this place to be bigger than it ended up being but it had more than I expected to see. It has two floors and special exhibit areas.   Even though the aquarium is priced on the expensive side it was well spent unlike the Academy of Science which I would only go on a free day. My favorite was the secret lives of seahorses exhibit where I was able to see seahorses/sea dragons and the jellies gallery where I was able to see cool jellyfish. The touch pools were a nice addition though the water was freezing cold. The splash zone was really cool with water rushing down above you every couple of minutes. There were a lot of interesting sea life to see in the kelp forest. We did our best to get back to the car but we went over the hour by probably a couple of minutes and had to pay for another half hour...oh well. So our total for parking came out to be $10.50 for having spent 4hrs at the aquarium. After wanting to come here for so long it was nice to finally come here but I think it will be quite awhile before I will find the need to come back.
3828,2010-10-12,4,"i have heard a lot about this aquarium and saw lots of pictures, which made me envious! i must go! so my bf and i went last valentine's day weekend i think and got membership for college students to go as much as you want for a year. which is more worth it than paying almost the same price to go once i believe.the scenery there is really nice, great for pictures, all the lil shops and tourist-y things were cute to look at. the first time we went, we left from sf a lil late, so we didn't have much time to look around and stuff but it was still really peaceful and pretty.the second time we went, we took our time in areas we hadn't seen. there was never that many ppl when we went cuz i think we always pick odd days to go to places (and the bf hates crowded areas anyways). the new fun thing we tried was the flamingo exhibit! haha had a cool interactive section where.....well you can go and find out. we saw ppl feeding the fishes and the view was really nicee....really cute place to gaze at things with your other half.we parked in the structure the first time, but second time we parked on the streets. 4-5 hours is plenty enough to see the place. we're prolly gonna go one more time before the membership expires."
3829,2010-10-05,5,"Sometimes I forget how amazing this place is because as a local, its the go-to place when out of town family visits or because we've all been here a million times on field trips as children.; however, now that I'm an adult and have my own little one, my love for the MBA has grown ten-fold. Its beautiful, well organized with so many different interactive experiences and exhibits. My favorite is still the jellies, my daughter's is the outer-bay ""because it feels like you are inside"" I could also sit and watch the auto-wave machine in the beach room with all the birds forever, its so cathartic."
3830,2011-06-15,3,"Fun place to spend the day. Kids could probably spend the whole day as an adult probably more like a few hours., Definitely one of the better aquariums."
3831,2011-07-26,5,If you come to Monterey you must visit the Aquarium!  it is amazing for all ages.  I am a local artist and I have painted many paintings just off of photos I took while visiting this wonderful place.  Check it out for private parties as well its beautiful in there at night!
3832,2009-11-05,5,"This place is so classy. It's in no way just for children or families. Anyone can enjoy walking through the exhibits, relaxing to the music (yes, music!) that seems to guide your mood (-tranquil). There is so much to see, one really needs to alot a few hours at least. The Sea Horse exhibit is awesome, and mesmerizing. I've never even imagined that there are critters like this living on the planet!The service personnel are genuinely interested in educating the public. They're very interactive, even the volunteers are wonderful!Two things though:One is that the price is almost prohibitively high, but fortunately there are ways to get discounts. Just hunt around on line first for coupons or hotel packages.If all else fails, buy your tickets at the AAA office for a 3 dollar per ticket discount. (and save time standing in line).The other is the cafe is very limited and over priced. So if you have a family, be sure you eat first before entering.All in all a fantastic attraction in a spectacular location."
3833,2009-02-16,5,"speaking to the choir! MBA does a wonderful job of of being family friendly and providing an educational experience, no matter your age. Make sure you plan your trip to be there for the feedings - Penguins, Otters, Outer Bay (Tuna). The 15-20 minute feedings with commentary and 30 minutes afterward when you can monopolize an employee/volunteer's time to learn a little more are invaluable."
3834,2010-02-15,5,I'll make this short.  It was my first time & it was awesome.  I touched a sting ray & it was cool.  I touched a starfish & it felt like a rock.  I also got tickets on Craigslist for half off so hollllla.
3835,2008-02-23,5,"I have been coming here since a child and I will never stop. I love seeing all the sea life and learning about it. It is a great destination for families, romantic dates, or just for a day with friends. Love the current exhibit ""Wild About Otters"" featuring river otters in a large woodsy environment with lots of viewing areas. Loved watching them glide through the water and cuddle with each other! My other favorite thing was to watch the Sea Otters play together in their tank. One of them had a baby blanket that he was holding on to. How cute is that??? My other favorite thing is the petting area where you can pet starfish, cownose rays, and other little creatures."
3836,2006-07-01,5,"Very cool! However, it is not as interactive and San Diego's Seaworld. They do have a lot of jellyfish and other more exotic species. Many years ago, I saw the Sunfish and was told that it is very rare. That was very impressive."
3837,2008-03-25,5,For over 5 yrs I have gone to monterey for my birthday. We always go to Aquarium when we visit. They always have new excibits as wells as long term. They have a largejelly fish excibit expanding across two subjects. This is a great aquarium located in a protected beach zone. They promote education and have information on protecting local wild life. In all this is the best aquairiam I have been to.
3838,2011-04-03,4,"I would LOVE to give this place 5 stars, but it lacks a few things that are important. Very important. First the ""flow"" is just not right, when you have hundreds of people walking into a large visual, you want them to continue through without having to double back if they want to go to another exhibit. Second the largest tank is closed for restoration. That's like not having 3d glasses at a 3d movie..this is the main attraction. at least let people know this tank is closed. other wise its a great place surrounded by great food and fun for the kids. Overall i had a good time, but was very disappointed when i couldn't find the big tank."
3839,2009-01-14,5,"The business of aquariums doesn't always make people happy. Holding animals captive from their native environment isn't the greatest idea. However, the monterey bay aquarium takes animal care to a different level. To rehabilitating animals, to research on sustainable fishing, to educating people about the amazing underwater world...no other aquarium compares. My favorite part of the museum is Seafood Watch, an informative and interesting compilation of information regarding sustainable seafood. Can't wait to see what else the aquarium comes up with..."
3840,2010-09-17,5,Rode our motorcycles to Monterrey for the day. The aquarium was incredible. Very informative. Not just a field trip for the kids! We were there for almost two hours and only saw one arm of the exhibits. I loved the seahorses. I highly recommend the aquarium for adults and kids alike.
3841,2010-09-13,3,"Not bad.  I appreciate the work they do and to try to educate the public about the importance of ecologically responsible consumption.  However, I think $30 for an adult ticket is a bit steep, especially when you're getting your toes run over by small children and double strollers."
3842,2010-09-12,5,"Wow this place is awesome! My favorite was the Jellies exhibit. We parked in a nearby garage for $10 (all day) and the aquarium was a short walk. We went on a Saturday and the place was crowded with lots of kids and strollers. There is a lot to see, so be sure to give yourself 3-4 hours to browse and enjoy everything. There is also a cafe inside that was surprisingly delicious with plenty of healthy food options. This is great for a family event or a date. Check it out!"
3843,2010-10-11,5,"Awesome.  Potentially the best aquarium in the country.  Very cool collection of local creatures.  There's nothing I can say here that the previous 888 reviewers haven't already, but trust me if you're into museums it's something you should see while you're in the Bay Area."
3844,2013-06-29,5,We've been coming here every summer for the last six years. Our girls are always excited to get there and we continue to learn something new and interesting each year. We love supporting this amazing aquarium and anticipate our next adventure!
3845,2007-09-09,5,I loved it. I am an avid animal lover. So this is my type of place. Would go back anytime.
3846,2011-05-12,5,"This place is simply WONDERFUL, for both kids and adults.  Go there early, enjoy a fun day surrounded by incredible sea-life!  One of the most beautiful aquarium in the world, yes it's that good!"
3847,2007-07-11,5,"Wow, this is an amazing place!  With all of the reviews, I don't really need to add much but I had such a wonderful time here I feel compelled to add a few things!  First, they play this calypso type music for the penguins.  Apparently penguins love music, especially calypso...the penguins were dancing!  It was so funny to watch.  We spent a lot of time there!  Second, the sea otters were just hilarious, they have all these toys floating in the water for them to play with.  Too funny!  I was also there right around the time when they had just acquired the baby great white.  This was one of the coolest things I have ever seen.  Seeing a great white up close is in itself a pretty neat thing but a baby great white in captivity is pretty amazing!  I also loved watching the feedings....I plunked myself right on down in the middle of a group of little kids and laughed like a goon at how funny the feedings were!  I found the staff to be funny and very friendly.  The aquarium is very clean, bright, sunny, happy, etc etc etc.  One suggestion, if you can buy your ticket at a hotel nearby to avoid the lines.  I bought my ticket at my hotel and we were able to walk right in and start exploring.  This is a very cool place!  Two big thumbs up!"
3848,2007-09-09,5,"Amazing experience!  It's a huge place, great for family, friends, and even a date.  It definitely brings out the child-like feelings of wonder, and isn't that something we lack nowadays? The jelly-fish exhibit is my favorite.  They also have the feeding schedule for different animals, I recommend getting there early for the otter one...they are so cute! Also check out the sun-fish, it was the weirdest thing I've seen...."
3849,2007-05-29,3,"The first time I was here I was still in grade school, and I would have given it 5 stars.  Fast forward 20 years and I have to give it three stars.  Why?  It went from being larger than life to a small attraction.  And it'll set you back a cool 20 bucks or so just to get in.  Ok, maybe the only time I get off on fish is when it's on a bed of rice wrapped in seaweed.  Man, wouldn't that be awesome!  A sushi shop inside an aquarium.  Not only do you get to appreciate magnificent sea life, you get to eat it!  Fresh!  But yes, they do have a lot of fishes here, everything from the seals, to the kelp forest, to the petting zoo where you get to play with urchins and starfish.  Maybe in another 20 years I'll take my kids here, and bump my review up another star.  I know they'll appreciate this place more than I do now."
3850,2010-08-03,5,"Best Aquarium hands down! I have the seafood watch app on my phone, we're facebook friends. I heart them. You must go if you're in Monterey and have never been. Usually I make a quick tour, hit the otter exhibit. They have 2 new babies!!! Check them out around feeding time. I head over to the Sea Horses and Jellies, spend some time at the huge outer bay tank. Head back to the other side say ""hello"" to the penguins, pet some rays, ogle the kelp forest and don't use my flash on the octopus, then get the hell out before I reach my quota of pushy tourists for the day."
3851,2006-11-20,5,"The steep admission price is worth the jellyfish orgy exhibit. Its kinda cool watching these brainless creatures frolick around while getting tangled in their tentacles against a soothing blue background. The other thing I enjoy watching is the ray petting area..  there is a big sign that says ""Do NOT grab the rays"".. and yet every person manages to grab hold of the hapless rays."
3852,2007-08-06,5,"i've been here many times over the course of the last few years and i still have the same sense excitement every single time i go.  the lil kid in my just starts jumping up and down in joy and goes into super ADD mode when inside this place.  i just love running from exhibit to exhibit and checking out all the minute details each of them has to offer!  my favorite exhibit is the outer bay one.  i love watching the tuna, sharks and sunfish and was there when they had the baby great white.  of course not everyone else shared my enthusiasm.  i took my mom there cuz i HAD to see the great white.  so we get to the exhibit and the convo goes like this:Me: WOW THERE IT IS!!!!  SO COOL!Mom: where is it??Me: there it is!  right there!Mom:  It's so small!  we drove all the way here for that??"
3853,2007-06-23,3,"Great displays. We enjoyed the giant sunfish and the river otters. Good luck seeing the feeding of the ocean otters. The river otters were just as interesting, but without the crowds. Jellyfish were great too. Quite a few of them. Price is steep. This would be a 4 or 5 star value at $15. At $25, it's not a great value, but worth a one time visit."
3854,2009-01-13,5,This place was so cool took the fam to this place and we spent hours there looking at everything the kids loved it. they had alot of stuff for kids to do there and alot of different stuff to look at. We will be going back again soon
3855,2013-04-27,4,"It's a wonderful place for young children, but with the price so high I recommend getting the annual membership. No lines, and you can visit all year."
3856,2010-10-22,5,"I can't believe I forgot to review! We came here the day after 4th of July and had an awesome time! VERY CLEAN! and in  the bathrooms, they actually provide covers for the changing tables! They have volunteers at all the exhibits who actually enjoy what they do and give you little nuggets of knowledge when you're looking at things. The one thing I didn't like was the lack of trash cans. But since you're not supposed to bring in food or drinks I guess it makes sense. (I'm a rebel and snuck in samiches and juice)"
3857,2006-01-16,5,The beautifully designed and well-maintained galleries and exhibits will introduce you to the animals of Monterey Bay. Adults and children of all ages will find something of interest. My younger children enjoyed watching the sea otter feeding and the many hands-on exhibits.
3858,2006-08-11,5,"My first time ever to the Aquarium!  I had so much fun learning and looking at all the creatures!  My one year old loved watching the deep sea exhibit as well as the sharks and jellyfish.  You could hear his excited shrieks as he saw fish bigger than him swim pass him.  I can not believe I've waited this long to go here, but sharing this first with my son make this place so much more memorable!  I like how they have the touch pools, and the kids area..where kids can run around and play with toys while learning about whales and dolphins."
3859,2007-08-10,5,"Awesome! I love everything about this place. I remember going here when I was in elementary school and recently went back and it was great as ever!  Where else can you see what they showcase here??!! I love the penguins, and otters...too cute! Definitely a great outing and for the price I consider it a bargain."
3860,2009-02-09,5,"This is definitely a world-class facility.  I was here when I was a kid, and now I feel like I can appreciate it even more.  My favorite parts were the penguins and otters (who doesn't like them?)  The kelp forest was fantastic as well.  I wish the seahorse exhibit was open already, but the jellies were plenty fascinating.  We were good for a 2 hour visit, which was helped by the lack of heavy crowds on a Monday afternoon."
3861,2010-11-23,4,"Shark and tuna pens are both closed till next summer. Exhibits where great, alot to do in one day. But if u have little ones, there are plenty of touching and play areas for them. My favorite was the kelp forests. Fish came right up to the glass almost to perform for us."
3862,2007-07-30,4,"Good times for everyone...tons of crazy jellyfish...the slick otters with their little hands...sharks, giant sunfish, and even ""real"" sea-horses.  I also liked how the exhibits are interactive, so you can push buttons and yank levers for all of us hyperactive folk."
3863,2009-09-19,5,This is the largest aquarium that I've ever been to. The location is perfect. It is definitely worth the price.
3864,2010-09-06,2,"This was a fun place to go to but we went on labor day weekend. What a mistake! Super packed and stuffy. Heard alot about this place being amazing but to me it was just so so. Spent only a few hours here and went straight to walk around the wharf instead. And to me that was the highlight of the day! Also, the outter bay was closed, which was a huge disappointment. Also, buy your tickets online or have them waiting at will-call. Super long line that we had to wait in forever just to get tickets."
3865,2009-08-06,4,"This place was pretty cool.  We went a few weekends ago, and from what I have heard, we chose the busiest weekend.  Parking was a horrible experience.  It took us almost 40 mins to find parking.  Once we got inside it was so packed we left, went to eat, and then returned later to see the rest of the aquarium.  Best idea we had all day.  I loved the sea horses exhibit.  In the childrens area they had another small tank with beautiful colorful fish.  The jellyfish were another favorite of mine.  My husband loved the exhibit where you could touch the starfish and sea cucumbers.  That was pretty cool.  Overall, I liked it and would go back."
3866,2006-09-16,5,"I've been to aquariums all over the world (literally!), and this one is still the best I've ever been to, and keeps getting better.  We put our money where our mouth is, and have been members (with guest passes) for several years, so we can skip the very long lines to get in.  If you can get tickets in advance or get guest passes from a friend, you too can skip the lines.I like the usual favorites including the open ocean tank (which once again has a young great white shark) and the kelp forest, as well as the jellyfish exhibit.  Don't miss the shore bird aviary or the window *up* into the open ocean tank (it's in the bottom level in the section that talks about sustainable fishing).  The sea otters I can do without, though.The kids will love it here (duh!); so will the grownups, as long as there aren't *too* many kids around.  To avoid this problem, try going mid-week in the morning.  Just be careful of school tours, which often go here during the school year.  If you get hungry, the cafe here is surprisingly good (and not terribly expensive), and the fish is quite tasty.  I particularly like the fish and chips, but often go for the special of the day (typically chicken or fish).Bottom line: go!  You won't regret it."
3867,2012-04-12,5,"This place is the biggest, cleanest, most amazing, and best aquariums I have ever been in my life!"
3868,2007-05-15,5,"I LOVE the Monterey Bay Aquarium and I miss going here every year although I DON'T miss the tool I used to go with, aka the gay ex-husband.  That aside, I still loved watching the tuna in the tank and thinking that sashimi would be good right about now.  Watching little kids learning about the sea and conservation is also touching.  I always revert to an awestruck child when I'm here and my cheesy grin is plastered on my face all day."
3869,2008-06-08,5,I would give this a 4 bc it is a bit too Tiffany for my taste BUT the fish feeding is worth the trip.  Seeing 100 lb fish shoot around like darts was really cool.  Usually fish just saunter about in an aquarium - seeing them rushing for eats at top speed was great.
3870,2008-09-23,3,"I expected it to be BIGGGGER.  For $24.95, it better be.  So I was disappointed that they didn't have any cetaceans on-site.  The only sea mammal they have, the sea otter, is a big rat that can swim.  While the jellies section was colorful, the inability to dip into the tank and throw jellies at people is a missed opportunity.  I wish they angered up the sharks more.  The ocean sunfish looks like the dumbest fish in the ocean.  I can't believe they didn't have sea turtles.  Too much focus on the wants of children so that means there were these Plaskool stuff littered all over the aquarium that I was embarassed to step into.  More adult research-oriented offerings would've been welcome.  I was in and out of there in a couple of hours."
3871,2009-05-03,3,I go about once a year. Its a little expensive but admission fees support a nonprofit organization.  Save the Oceans.
3872,2011-01-08,4,"Have wanted to visit the aquarium for years and finally had the chance. Very nice. I absolutely loved the sea dragons, sea horses and jellies exhibits.  Must see."
3873,2008-04-04,3,"Don't come if you aren't a fan of children. I like kids and all, but the place was a zoo - overcrowded, loud, and crazy kids running all over the place. The aquarium itself was pretty cool - it's definitely interactive and geared towards learning because it's not all live creatures, there's lots of other stuff too."
3874,2006-03-27,5,"A great experience. I loved it so much I became a member...and never went back. Give me a break, I live in Boston!"
3875,2008-04-14,4,"You're never too old to appreciate a trip to the aquarium. I recommend coming here once in your life. The jellyfish are definitely a site to see, that and the penguins. It's located in a nice area, so afterward you can take a nice walk, have a meal, what have you. I think the last time I was there was 2004 so that means it's time to go back. Hurry and visit before the admission goes up!!!"
3876,2013-03-03,4,"This aquarium is really nice.  There's lots of stuff to see and it was a good all day activity.  The jellies and seahorses were the best. I would give it 5 stars, but I HATE crowds, and this place is REALLY crowded.  Be prepared to get run into a lot.  It would be nice if they didn't allow strollers in certain areas, because they caused certain spots to get really congested and it would take me forever just to try and navigate through them all."
3877,2007-02-27,5,One of my favorite places to be in the entire world! Absolutely AMAZING. Please take advantage of their knowledgeable volunteers (esp the ones that have been there for a while). Ask questions... You can learn so much!
3878,2007-04-08,3,"The aquarium would have received 5 stars if it weren't for the hoardes and hoardes of screaming of rug-rats clogging up the place. Okay, okay, so we did go Easter Saturday afternoon, so we what did we expect? Maybe they could have an ""adults only"" evening for the barren few who don't want to ""share"" with the little folks."
3879,2007-12-02,5,"This place is always cool whenever I come back every few years. I hope they NEVER get rid of the jellies, they are why I come back. The new river otter exhibit was cool, too, but I still think their bigger, fatter ocean cousins are still the shit. We were only there for about 2 hours but were exhausted when we left. It's super packed in there on the weekends with hyper-active kids running around, which is cool. The shops is always great. I can see why one would want to shop for presents there if you are into that. Sea otter socks rule! I know I am sick, but whenever I see those big ass tunas swimming in the deep sea tank, I always start getting hungry for toro . . . I told you I was sick."
3880,2008-03-24,5,"I've been here a few times and definitely love everything that this Aquarium has to offer. Since they opened a few new exhibits, the place has taken on a better look!  It's fun coming here and staring at all the animals. Also, it's soooo nice standing out on the deck and watching the otters and taking in the view."
3881,2009-08-06,3,"The MBA was far better ten years ago. Since then it has become a preachy place (e.g. humans are destroying this and that) that is packed with non-animal displays such as otter art rooms and other activities for kids. It is very child friendly (and is incredibly packed with them) but is not nearly as fun for adults. They claim to need more money, but the crowds were horrendous on a Wednesday afternoon. I can't imagine how wretched they are on the weekends. I have been going there for 22 years, but I think this will be my last time until I have children of my own (assuming the crowds die down)."
3882,2010-11-11,4,"If you go on a non busy day and you have your kids, nephew or niece with you its well worth it.. You get to see some interesting fishes and that have scuba lessons there. I would say its a little over priced just to see some fishes. Also a nice place to bring a date.."
3883,2014-12-29,4,"I did not give this place 5 stars because for the expectation of being a huge aquarium, I expected a little more. Also the crowd factor and size of the exhibits were a little much for children. My daughter loved it, and she is 2. I enjoyed seeing her reactions and seeing the exhibits. There was no action in the outside viewing area when we went. We did go on a Saturday and had tickets already bought, otherwise the line is crazy! When we were inside, there is no courtesy for the kids. Whenever we waited for an opening, we would proceed to it, only to be overtaken by an adult with their nikon or canon camera to get up close up to the glass shots. My daughter almost got stepped on too. Then when there is a line for taking pictures by a giant clam for the kids, random people would shove their kids in front of yours and others, and pretend to speak another language, even when I know that other language. There were only a couple, and seemed like the older generation, staff members who didn't like or got stressed watching the young ones touch or try to touch the creatures in the ""Touching"" tide pools. While the younger staff members went out of their way to insist they pick them up and let the crabs walk on their hands. It's a nice experience, but one that I do have to agree with the locals, ""Come on weekdays and non holidays and non school break periods."" Oh and parking is a couple blocks down in a garage for $10, cash and credit. There were other parking places if you miss the garage but they charge $30, and not worth it. It literally is next to the parking garage."
3884,2007-07-05,4,"My friend brought me here last summer and I was little skeptical because the last time I went to the aquarium was probably on field trip in elementary school.  Much to my surprise, it was pretty amazing.  It dwarfs other aquariums I've been to (no offense--big ups to New England!).  I got to pet bat rays and took in the beauty of Monterey Bay--great visit."
3885,2007-11-18,5,"This place was such a relief-- they had an entire exhibit on responsible seafood eating, and even give out wallet sized cards detailing what fish are ecologically safe to eat. The last two aquariums I went to hid fish eating like it was Anne Frank's family, and their cafeteria menus consisted of faceless Soylent Nuggets and burgers. Oh, and it was pretty and stuff."
3886,2009-07-14,3,"So I guess this is what the best aquarium looks like. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I thought it was just OK. $29.00 to get in seemed a little on the high side especially after we were done with the aquarium in about 2 hours. There are some nice exhibits, but I don't think I would come here again. If you do happen to visit this place I would definitely buy tickets else where, because the line was long."
3887,2010-07-14,5,"5 stars for the cute little penguins, seahorses, & cuttlefish! =]"
3888,2006-09-28,5,"Whats great about the Monterey Bay Aquarium is that they're VERY active in their community, always sponsoring local events and educational drives. Halloween every year is a favorite for kids."
3889,2009-11-02,5,"love the aquarium in the off season.we get a membership every year and it's well worth it! play hookie from work/school in october with no tourists around and sit in the main room and watch the sun fish,tuna and turtles go by...if they only served beer"
3890,2011-09-17,3,"I came here 25 years ago when I was a kid. It was first time since then and while it was still cool, it was a letdown in that now it is $30 to get in which to me is a major ripoff. I did not see any Great White sharks and since that was my whole thing, was bummed out. The Hammerhead sharks and different sea jelly creatures were cool as were the seahorses but this place was kinda small."
3891,2010-06-29,5,I came here with my boyfriend and it was a huge aquarium. It was broken into different sections. So much to look at and learn. They had a lot of varieties of jellyfishes and seahorses and tropical fishes. The sea otter was so adorable swimming on its back. I would definitely come back here again.
3892,2010-04-29,5,"Hands down best aquarium on the west coast, and east coast from what I've seen. A large variety of aquatic life and extremely large tanks and very nice layout. Very big place. Love it"
3893,2010-07-22,4,"My main reason for visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium was to see the highly advertised ""The Secret Lives of Seahorses"" exhibit, and it surely did not disappoint!  This exhibit alone was well worth it in my opinion.  It was well organized with a really extensive variety of seahorse species to look at.  Most other visitors seemed really excited and pleased by this exhibit as well."
3894,2012-06-14,4,"I have been here a few times and have not had a bad experience. The employees and researchers are very friendly and knowledgeable. My 2 year old was fascinated with the seagulls on the patios that over look the tide pools most of all. all the interactive activities are great for the adults as well as the kids and the kelp farm with all the fish and sharks is awesome. My step-dad  loves jelly fish so he had a blast in the groovy new jelly fish exhibit. I also noticed that since the last time my wife and I had been here they had art that was apparently made out of items that had been recovered out of the ocean to show what kind what kind of ecoterrorists man kind is. aside from the obvious political message of the descriptions on the artwork, the work itself is actually quiet amazing. I will tell you eat before you come here because a single banana and a single serving bag of chips cost us $5 so the food if outrageously priced. I have found a good hotel in the area and love the shops down the street, and not to mention the awesome displays here at the aquarium, I think i might have one of my favorite vacation spots picked out."
3895,2010-07-10,4,"The aquarium had many exhibits. It was very busy at the time we went, and it was difficult to enjoy the experience as much as we wanted. It's worth going if in the area."
3896,2013-02-20,4,"First time going and had a good time. The jelly fish exhibit alone was worth going to see. So beautiful. I thought it was pretty cool to watch some of  fish exhibits during feeding time. A little sad certain things were closed down, since it was my first time but willing to return in the future to catch what I missed."
3897,2010-08-12,3,The sea otters and penguins were adorable and almost worth the  cost of admission. I must have visited the wrong place because I keep hearing how it takes hours to see everything and yet it only took my family and I about an hour or so to see it all.
3898,2012-08-08,5,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Seriously. Love. it. Its so educational and a great experience. I do wish that it was a bit more affordable. At $35/per person, it adds up quick. The over all experience, helpfulness of the staff and desire to teach people is amazing."
3899,2007-03-01,4,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is just awesome. So many species to see, large tanks, and perfect location. It can be a little pricey, but prepare to spend the whole day here! Get there early (before noon), especially on the weekends, to avoid the lines. Also, pack a lunch; it'll save you tons of money that you can later spend on a good seafood dinner!"
3900,2008-06-25,5,"My favorite place in the aquarium is the Splash Zone, where the penguin exhibit is located.  It's expensive to enter the aquarium itself, but it's absolutely worth a visit when in Monterey for the first time.  I also heard that  free passes are available from the Monterey County Public Library after applying for a library card.  Hmm....  I'll have to give an update on that one..."
3901,2008-08-08,3,"This was just really average.  I wasn't blown away by anything.  They did have a serious collection of jellies.  I was hoping to see the infamous Irukandji jellyfish, but that's not in the collection.  I wouldn't return, but I've checked the box."
3902,2007-07-09,5,"first, this place should be called the monterey bay zoo, not the monterey bay aquarium.  madness!  avoid the weekends if you can, otherwise make sure you have your ""happy place.""that said, i had a great time here.  it's very well laid out so you can make it through without feeling like you missed anything, there are plenty of descriptions so you know what you're looking at, it's clean, and it's just awesome."
3903,2007-09-03,4,"i took my husband here on a trip down the coast, and we had a great time. it is expensive ($25 an adult), but the jellyfish rooms are fabulous. the blue background and lit up orange jellyfish is a beautiful site.the kelp forest tanks are beautiful, too - and the otters. best of all was the mola / sunfish, which is truly an alien species.we were there on the saturday of a holiday weekend, without any little ones, so it was crowded, but if you get away from the especially kid-friendly areas you can have a quieter experience."
3904,2008-06-30,5,"Otters!!!! All I need say, otters!!! I turn into a total kid when I'm here, I run around like I had ADD, and point and jump, it's great. Now I love the jellies, and the exhibit here is beautiful. The jellies are given enough space, and the right lighting to really enjoy their beauty. Now the sea otters are my favorite! I literally sit in front of their tank and watch them for hours, not only during feedings, but just to enjoy them. I love the way they lay around, play and interact....they remind me of my puppy, I love them. MBA has an amazing tank for these cuties....thank you for bringing me closer to one of my favorite animals.The string rays....wow....I love touching them, watching them fly through the water, and really.....getting this close to any animal, especially Mr. Ray, is an experience that any child should get to have. The penguin splash zone...I haven't seen it yet, but I am dying to go! I hear it is AMAZING!My one complaint is the price....I realize that upkeep and research etc is costly, but really, I feel like $15 would be more appropriate, so everyone could enjoy it."
3905,2008-08-21,4,"I've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium a handful of time.  I just went again a couple days ago.  Prices are kind of steep I think.  Especially if you're going with a family, then it just really adds up.  It doesn't seem too bad if it's just one person.  I actually remembered the aquarium being bigger than it was.  We saved 2.5 hours for the aquarium, but we finished going through it in much less time.  I love the sea otters.  They are super cute!  But my favorite exhibit has to be the jelly fish. They are so cool!  I could just stand there watching them for hours.  They're fascinating.  Definitely go check out the jelly fish exhibit if you go.  And the Sea Dragons!  I'd never seen a Sea Dragon before, so that was pretty cool too.  They look like bigger Sea Horses with bunches of seaweed growing out of them.  Crazy."
3906,2009-01-08,5,"What can I say that 485 reviews before me haven't?  Not much, honestly.   This is one of the best aquariums I've ever been to, and I've been to a bunch.  If you're in town, or within driving distance, and you've never been here before, stop wasting time!  Life is short!  Get your ass down here and check it out at LEAST once."
3907,2009-10-13,5,Never get tired of this place. I grew up coming here as a kid and still enjoy it. I go to a lot of museums and aquariums and this is still one of my favorites. They really put a lot of work into it and always have new exhibits. Defiantly one of the best things Monterey has to offer.
3908,2010-10-27,5,"Not much changes if you went here 10 years ago, but still amazing to see. Most of the exhibits are pretty cool, especially the jellyfish exhibit. But if you want good photos, get a real camera, phone camera wont work well.27.99 for students!"
3909,2010-06-24,5,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium!  I have been coming for years, and more recently I started bringing my niece.  I try to get here when it opens, as it gets SO SO crowded.  (Buy tickets ahead of time so you don't have to stand in the ridiculously long line.)  After enjoying the exhibits for a few hours (the seahorses!  the jellies!  the petting tank! the otters!) we have lunch at the Portola Restaurant, their fancier restaurant.  The most gorgeous views, and a place of calm after the crowded aquarium.  Really good food, the only bad thing I ever had was the fish and chips.  After lunch, a few more hours enthralled, a stop at the gift shop (now that is some fine merchandise), and I am happy.  What a fine place and organization."
3910,2010-10-23,4,Very worthwhile way to spend a few hours. Go a few blocks west and park on the street for free rather than paying to park.
3911,2007-06-15,5,"A world class institution, this place is worth the long drive to go see it from San Francisco, we drove it in a day. It really is worth its admission price and the drive down to it (via Pacific Hwy 1) is gorgeous! The beauty of this aquarium is matched by its setting alongside Monterey Bay, perfectly integrated into the coastline. I love the gargantuan glass exhibits that let you feel immersed in the aquatic environment. Jellyfish, sharks, and seals oh my. Plus, the cafeteria here is well stocked (I dig the cheese and fruit servings, so California!). PS: I am from Miami and though we have amazing sea life, this aquarium puts ours into shame!"
3912,2007-07-26,5,"If you know ANYONE, regardless of age, who is curious about marine life, bring them here! my 1st visit was on a crazy,crowded Saturday, along with two friends and their 3 children, ages 7,5, and 2. Everyone was entertained and happy. We were able to watch them feed the wildlife, and the 'petting zoo' is a great way for kids (and squeamish adults) to learn about our friends in the sea."
3913,2008-10-01,5,"this place is my haven.  i can sit in front of the outer bay tank for hours, especially if there's a sea turtle who's friendly enough to swim near the glass a few times.  i come here every year for my anniversary and it never gets old.  i really wish my wedding date was available (not mention if it was within my budget) this would have been a dream come true.  i enjoy the jellyfish exhibits and was happy to see their new seahorse exhibit.  those little critters are the so interesting.plus, there's a dippin dots across the street...BONUS!"
3914,2008-11-28,5,"Great for killing a few hours and taking dates. Watch the large tank feeding, take lots of pictures, plan your route throughly to easily cover every square inch. Expect to pay $25 per person."
3915,2009-07-15,5,"I have to say that I have been going here for a long time. Every time I visit family, we stop in to see the newest exhibit. This weekend it was the seahorses. I was so impressed. This museum does an amazing job at displaying wildlife in a way that makes you feel they are happy in their environment. The seahorses were beautiful, and they had such a variety of types (which I did not know existed). Even the African otters were having such a great time playing with each other and their toys, they didn't even seem to notice that they had dozens of faces plastered up against the window staring at them. I hope to come here many more times."
3916,2009-07-22,4,"The jellyfish room might be my favorite spot. The aquarium didn't live up to the hype for me, but it was a fun day. Will go back if there are ever kiddos in tow, but probably not without."
3917,2009-09-19,4,"We went down for the ""secret life of seahorses"" exhibit and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Hadn't heard about the white shark, so that was a bit of a surprise but she was so cute!!  We spent 2.5 hours walking through - probably could have done a solid 3 hours.  Would definitely recommend, the jellyfish exhibit and adorable SEA OTTERS were great as well!!"
3918,2010-09-02,4,"Loved all the jellyfish, sardines, anchovies, cuttlefish, octopi, shrimp, sand dollars, sharks, penguins, otters, seahorses and other colorful aquatic creatures I hadn't even dreamt of before.  The location is absolutely fantastic.  The parents were happy we went here.  Its nice to sit on the benches and watch the ocean on a clear day.   They have educational programs in the auditorium all the time - we sat through the sea otter presentation.   Was delighted to get free wi-fi access on my google phone.  The atmosphere is upbeat as you see a lot of young people around.  I happened to park in the Hotel Intercontinental garage and it was a rip-off at 20 bucks."
3919,2005-12-13,5,"This has got to be one of the best aquariums in the world.  It's worth the exorbitant cost just to watch the tuna swimming in the pelagic tank, to watch the jellyfish drift in their bubbles, to see all the bizzare, surreal sea life.  I come here so often i decided it was worth my while to become a member, Now i make pilgramige to here three or four times a year.  Its always facinating, always fun, if only it was closer."
3920,2006-08-28,3,"this place is nice, there were a lot of kids the day i went... not very disciplined children as they were running around like maniacs and plastering their sticky hands and faces to the glass of the aquariums...it's difficult to give this place a higher rating since i know there are way better aquariums around.. for example the one in singapore - they definately know how to exhibit wildlife, from their aquarium, jurong bird park, to their zoo which also features the night safari.  go to singapore if you're into that kind of stuff :D"
3921,2007-12-31,5,"I LOVED it here! My first time being in Monterey, at that. I went here with my family when I was 15 years old. I even skipped school, just so I can come with them! It was pretty busy with field trips and everything. Lots of kids around. The animals were awesome! You feel so small staring at them through the glass. Feels like they can just burst through it and eat you up whole, like that! Had a great experience here. Can't wait to go back again another time."
3922,2008-03-31,4,"It is always fun to come here.  The aquarium is huge and takes awhile to get through the whole thing. There are all different types of fishies everywhere, sea otters, penguins, jelly fish, and so much more.  They did some remodeling since the last time I was here which was probably 2004.  It was really crowded on a Sunday afternoon but we decided to do a quick walk through of it since we were in the area.  I'm so glad we did because they added a new penguin habitat rather than the old glass case you look through and just see two."
3923,2008-12-03,5,ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS PLACE. The aquariums and activities are SOOOOO AWESOME. My favorite part was the GIANT 1 million gallon aquarium I can't even describe it in words. They have so many interactive learning areas. I wish we could of spent more time up there. THIS IS A MUST at the minimally ONCE in your life. I plan to go again...hopefully REALLY SOON :)
3924,2009-05-27,4,"Great aquarium, although not as nice as San Francisco Aquarium [Aquarium of The Bay]. A lot of empty spaces. Their small displays are better than the big ones."
3925,2009-11-09,5,"Such a beautiful and clean place! Great, happy, staff and wonderful exibits!! I want to go again soon!!"
3926,2010-02-16,5,This Aquarium really lived up to its reviews! =) I got to visit this giant aquarium during this past Valentine's Day weekend (thank you hunnie!) and had a blast! We were able to catch the 3 main feeding shows they had there (Sea Otter/Kelp Forest/Outter Bay) I would say the Sea Otter exhibit was my favorite! =) They were just TOO CUTE! Visiting the aquarium is defin. a whole day event so make sure you do some research on their feeding schedules before you go and oh their food there is great too!
3927,2005-08-17,5,"What a great experience, I only wish I could've gone to see the first Great White Shark ever held in captivity which they had down the the Aquarium for awhile.  Creatures of the deep is my favorite exhibit."
3928,2006-10-12,5,"Been there once or twice, I think. Sorry the memory is vague. It's a pretty amazing resource though. They've got so much stuff if I wanted to be thorough I'd need to make two day pininc out of it. Can't describe every single detail. You just gotta go see for yourself."
3929,2007-08-22,4,"We took the kids yesterday for their 6th birthday and of course they loved it. It's our third time in as many years. And while the hands on experiences are terrific for them, I was less than enthused about the new sea otter exhibit. The handful of otters there were sleeping or hiding. Perhaps the aquarium should allocate more funds for more animals and less to lame stamp pad art projects for kids in the internet age. And an otter slide to feel like an otter sliding down the snow? why?"
3930,2008-04-05,5,"im 21 and i still love this place. if your not a fan of children, then it might be a problem. But besides that its amazing, educational, and very interesting."
3931,2008-05-12,4,"i love this aquarium!  4.5 stars for sure.  they have some unique stuff like 100-foot tall kelp being kept alive by a wave machine, and a crazy huge 4-paned window housing a few million gallons of water.  the jelly fish exhibit was beautiful, but not enough different types of jelly fish as i saw at the national at baltimore.  there were a bunch of kids there which was expected.  i heard that the aquarium has about 1.8 million visitors per year!there's this sting ray whose color is slightly lighter brown than the other sting rays at the touch pool.  he swims in a circle just outside of visitors' reach, and the circle gets larger and smaller depending on the reach of the different visitors.  what a bitch!!  i swear he really knows what he's doing.."
3932,2008-07-07,5,"Totally worth the drive + gas + price of admission! Brought my out-of-town bro here and we all loved it. I am especially glad I got to see the Jellies exhibit before it closes in September - the juxtaposition of art alongside the jellyfish was so cool, especially the Dale Chihuly installation! Beyond the awesome marine creatures (the giant octopus and sea otters were among my other faves), I also loved the visitor-friendly layout, the informative didactic panels and the helpful staff. The aquarium web site is also one of the easiest I've ever used - clear directions and parking info, easy online ticket purchasing, great exhibit and visitor tips.  I can't wait to go back, preferably with my young niece and nephew."
3933,2008-08-20,4,"I went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium's website for some random reason and found that there was a drawing to have ""Breakfast with the Penguins"" in honor of their newly redesigned Splash Zone. I entered the drawing knowing I would never win anything. Well, I did win and I had a blast!I brought my partner, my dad, my brother, my sister-in-law, my niece and my nephew. We got up earlier than I could imagine to get to the aquarium before it opened. We managed to park right in front of the aquarium on the street. It was too sweet a spot. There was a meter. I think it took credit cards. Just in case, I did a little research to find a couple parking lots/structures that open early and are in the neighborhood of the aquarium.We were met at the front entrance by Sharon Coggin. I think she is in the marketing unit. The first thing we saw were the otters. They were up and ready to play. We could not get them to stop frolicking about near the glass viewing area. The most wonderful part was that we had the aquarium to ourselves. We did not need to bob and weave through six rows of people to see them.Sharon took us up to the second floor and we went around the touch tanks. Afterward, we were led to the penguin exhibit. Cheyenne, who works at the Portola Cafe on the grounds of the aquarium, made us a breakfast that was served by Nat. We got to eat right in front of the penguin display. Dave, an engineer-type guy, allowed us to see how the water is taken in from the bay and circulated & filtered around the aquarium. Technical stuff like that is very neat.After breakfast, Danny brought out Karoo, one of the South African penguins, on a wheeled cart. We got to pet him and she told us a bit about the penguin program at the Aquarium. Check out the MBA You Tube video of penguins going down the red carpet. You'll see Karoo. They practice with him I think monthly, and he actually does do a mock red carpet walk for an event once a year. After that, we went over to touch the bat rays for a while and finally, the aquarium was open to the public.Things got super crowded after that. This is the only reason I can not give the MBA 5 stars; it is just full of so many people it is hard to see anything. The exhibit about Cannery Row was interesting for a few minutes. The seafood watch exhibit was done in a clever way. The actors they used for their video presentations were hilariously cheesy and memorable.The outer bay exhibit was very cool. Dave, from earlier, mentioned that we should get a spot right up front in the center. He was right; that was a perfect place to watch the mid-morning feeding. People were camping out there more than 30 minutes before the very quick feeding, but it was really cool to see all the huge fish swimming about.My favorite exhibit was the one with the jellies. That was SO COOL. I am sad it closes on 14 September, because they way they displayed them and used lighting meant I could have stayed at that exhibit for hours. Unfortunately, I became cranky and we had to go to the Portola Cafe for lunch. Check out my review of it.At the end of the day, I went home with my bag full of swag. I will be happy to go back when they have some new exhibits. Basically, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a fun place to hang out with the family or go on a date (I actually saw some ""lady"" with super-high heels and hoochie shorts. Really, now! Leave those at home.). Make it a day long trip see all you can see. It's all great."
3934,2008-09-17,5,"If you have kids, this is a must.  Even adults would love this place.  The big tank is the best and you can just sit there watching the sea animals.  The penguin exhibit is really fun as well and you can't beat the kids section where the kids can go through a coral playground, 'fish' the fake fish, and play with the boats in the waterslide."
3935,2008-09-27,4,This place reminds me of my childhood. I would go here so often as a kid. So it's pretty awesome. I think it's the biggest aquarium on the West Coast? Im not sure. And there is certainly a lot of people to prove so. There is the quintessential hall for the aquarium with the big tank with the kelp. The outer bay which was built like 10 years ago still rocks with the fucking huge-ass tank. It's probably worth it to get a membership if you're thinking about going back multiple times during the year. And usually the membership can count towards other places as well
3936,2009-02-19,5,I have been here at least a dozen times and this is the first time that there has been no construction. I love it. I could watch the sea otters all day. My husband has to pull me away because I am making a fool out of myself talking to them. Then I proceed to the gift store and kiss the stuffed animals. He hates it. We took some friends here from Missouri on Valentines Day and they had a wonderful time. I always love coming here and I always see something new and am amazed by how beautiful the sea and nature are.
3937,2009-05-14,5,"After cruising through Santa Cruz, we made a pit stop at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which I had heard/read so much about beforehand. Ticket prices are a little steep, but given it's for the preservation of ocean wildlife and the fact that once you see any of the incredible exhibits, you completely forget about the admission price. First stop was the sea otter feeding/training session; cool little guys. My favorite exhibit overall were the jelly fish; simply amazing! So many different colors and shapes and sizes; very cool. A close second was the seahorse exhibit; a must see. Who knew there were sea horses that look like seaweed? Really though, they look exactly like a plant. The tuna tank was awesome too, with all the enormous fish and a few sharks swimming around. I definitely recommend this place, it is well worth a trip."
3938,2009-10-12,5,"i've been here as a child with my family, and for school field trips, but i appreciate the wealth of knowledge and visuals of the sealife and such more as an adult.  it's amazing how they recreate the original environment of the creatures.  the enthusiasm and glee of the kid visitors itself is priceless.the aquarium promotes the care for endangered fish, and give out informative cards which direct you to which types of seafood you should and should not purchase."
3939,2010-01-04,4,"walk up to a jellyfish-filled tank with a lovely royal blue water to contrast. gaze away...then get bashed in the leg by some seemingly parentless kid.rinse, repeat"
3940,2014-08-10,4,"My son and I (he's 11) went on July 24th which was a Thursday.  I had made online reservations for our tickets and for him to participate in the Underwater Explorers Scuba Adventure.  So with his Explorers ticket and our day tickets - came to a total of $159.90.  The cost for us at least was well worth it.  We had a marvelous time - the exhibits were very nice and we were lucky - it was crowded but not unbearable (last summer we went to the Seattle Aquarium and the crowds there were awful).  My son's scuba instructor was Leroy - what a great guy.  He was very patient, kind and helpful to my son.  An experience he will remember for a very long time.  It was an all day experience for us because the scuba class is about 2 hours and then we spent about another 2.5-3 hours wandering around all the exhibits.  I would recommend to go with your kids - experiencing anyplace like this is much more enjoyable seeing it thru their eyes.  And if you don't want to go broke - stay away from the gift shop - we spent way too much there!!  The Underwater Explorers program is awesome - and if we make it back to Monterey - I would definitely sign my son up for another one - they offer several different ones."
3941,2011-01-08,4,"I went here today. It has changed since last time I was here. Now I have a membership, so I do not have to buy a ticket anymore and I can go to the members' entrance instead of the main entrance and do not have to wait in line to get a ticket. They added pink flamingos, which were so cool. I miss the shark tank that they took out. That was one my favorite parts! :( I also like the penguins there. There are cute animals."
3942,2012-07-30,4,"What an amazing facility! Very easy to navigate the two floors.  Friendly guides and knowledgeable, patient staff who will engage you for hours.  A wide variety of species and specimens.  Go early, purchase discount tix from local AAA office, find street parking for up to four hours.  Plenty of places to eat before or after.  A must see."
3943,2006-03-16,4,"Pretty neat aquarium. Then again, this is the only aquarium I've ever been too. The sandollars and starfish were my favorites, Yeah, I'm weird. The penguins did not look happy at all. That was kind of sad. But a great place for families and kiddos."
3944,2007-01-16,5,"Let me start off by admitting, I was born a po' white child. ;) What this means is, I've never been to an aquarium before (yes, and am 29 freakin' years old!!) so I have nothing to compare this to. But man oh MAN was it awesome!!! Honestly, even with all the hype and great reviews and friends telling me how cool it is, I still thought it would be mildly entertaining at best. But I was wrong and I say I'm wrong! I turned into a 6 year old again, and that just rocks. I was enthralled by every single exhibit. My favorites though, had to be the ginormous tank that holds the giant sunfish and massive yellowfin tunas and the other is definitely the jellies. There's just nothing as amazing as jellies that glow and trickle with rainbow light! Even the steep price is worth it, although I was lucky enough to have guest passes given to us by a friend. Added bonus!"
3945,2007-02-28,5,"I used to love going here when I was younger, and i have to admit that it's every bit as exciting now as it was when I was a kid. The exhibits here are cool, and the variety of sea life that they had was so cool. I liked seeing the new great white that they brought out, which resides in the same tank as a huge sunfish that looks like a giant turtle fish, hammerhead sharks, and tuna fish that are about 6ft long!  I liked the sea otters, but there arent as many there now as there used to be, and the seahorses, jellyfish, and penguins! We liked going to the touch pools to feel the starfish and stingrays. The cafeteria also had really good food to eat and it's endangered fish friendly =) Definitely great place for kids and families, but even when you're 20-something, it's still just as fun if you're into marine life!"
3946,2007-06-04,4,Always fun. Always fish and other sea creatures to see. Great place to take kids out of the house and have them explore new things.
3947,2007-06-27,3,"3.5 stars - I think my expectation was too high because of all the hype.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place and it's worth a visit but probably not quite worth the drive and getting in a long line waiting for it to open.  My nieces had a great time so that in itself made it all worthwhile...to see their smiles and excitement...these are moments money can't buy."
3948,2007-07-18,4,"Probably my favorite aquarium yet..  the exhibits are great but the little events - lectures, talks, presentations throughout the day are EXCELLENT!!  Even as an adult I feel I took away some cool facts and left feelings good about my ocean friends!"
3949,2007-08-22,5,"My friend Hubert took me here...that's when I knew he was cool.  The otter's reminded me of my dog Pepper, REALLY!   I think she is a mutant otter-jack russell mix. But I digress.  There are also some of the BIGGEST FISH I've ever seen and it did leave me wondering how many sushi rolls you could make out of one tuna. Go, it is so fun."
3950,2007-08-27,5,"I hadn't been down here in years, but I went back and it was still as amazing as when I went as a kid. They have so many different things to see and the ""petting zoo"" is the best. You have to come here if you're anywhere near the area."
3951,2008-02-04,5,this one was smaller than i had anticipated but that might be due to the fact that the penguin exhibit was closed. i guess i'll have to come back sometime after april to see the penguins!!but i did love what they had to offer plus monterer bay is beautiful so it's worth just seeing the surrounding areas of the aquarium.
3952,2008-03-10,5,"First time at monterey bay aquarium. I discovered my love for sea otters and how they have the best life ever just floating around on their backs, eating and cleaning themselves off. The jellyfish exhibit was outstanding. As the fish go...that goofy-looking baby sunfish was my favorite character in all of the aquarium!"
3953,2008-08-31,4,"I absolutely loved the jellyfish exhibits. Those creatures are just so amazing...I am in awe just looking at them. The touch pools were pretty cool too and the volunteers are knowledgeable and friendly. Anyways, remember to buy your tickets in advance so that you can avoid the loooong line for buying the tickets!"
3954,2008-09-24,5,"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium!  Growing up, we used to go here as a family and my favorites were touching the stingrays, watching the feedings and sea otters.  Since then, they added many more exhibits and each one has been a delight!  The Monterey Bay Aquarium makes learning fun!  It's a great place to take the family and friends."
3955,2008-12-20,5,"i could spend hours here... and as a local could always find my way in free. the winter weekdays seem like the best time to go.if i was feeling like a trip to the aquarium, i would head straight for the deep sea room and just get hypnotized by watching the fish. there's an upstairs viewing area, so i would plop my self down for some quiet time.once i feel recharged, then it's off to see the penguins. so cute and fun."
3956,2009-01-06,5,"Double WooHoo! This place rocks :) I love aquariums, and I love how they have so many HUGE tanks spanning both floors. They have an abundance of sharks. They have a really awesome jellyfish exhibit. I love this place! I remember coming here on a field trip in elementary school and I think I love it even more now that I'm older. I love the touch pools. It's so great that it's right on the ocean too. Can't wait to go back!"
3957,2009-02-07,5,I love this place but I miss the jelly fish exhibit BUT can't wait until the Sea horse's come on board in April. I like taking the ride down the coast to this aquarium and then going into under water mode as I step into the building. I take my time going through each exhibit as there is so much to see and learn. I love banging ( I mean tapping gently) on the octopus window to try to make it move from its corner. The sea otters are always pretty playful and fun to watch. I highly recommend this underwater escape.
3958,2009-03-28,4,"I LOVE THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM. If I lived in Monterey, I would come everyday. SO AWESOME. Educational and fun!"
3959,2009-04-25,3,"I came here twice both times with my boyfriend and 2 best friends. I love animals and nature itself, but i draw the line when there's so many other factors that disrupts this experience for me, and this place is filled with disruptions of what I think should of been a bit more of a peaceful experience.There's just too many cons about this place that just got me pissed both times that I came here. There's way too many people considering how small this place is. In most of the exhibits, I was waiting for people in front of me to finish looking at the exhibit so I can take a picture without their heads in the way, and there are always rude people. While I was waiting for one of the tinier exhibits, this mother with a kid tells the kid to go up to the exhibit knowing there were other people waiting. Not only that, but the kid literally would not let anyone else go close to this exhibit and the mom did nothing. I guess her mind set was ""oh he's a kid, kids are more important. let him see it first. plus he's my little prince.. you unimportant people can wait...."". I was so irritated already from the stuffiness and overcrowding of people that I just wanted to pull that kid away so I can snap a picture. Also, I was determined to take pictures of everything so I can get my money's worth. With this economy and me being a very poor college student, I want to get the most out of the money I spend. In my mind, this place really challenged that.Annoying facts about this place: exhibits too small, overcrowding, kids everywhere (can be good or bad), being totally rushed to see each exhibit because there's always people waiting, stuffy, and price is way too pricey for what you get to experience. With the price we have to pay, I expected much more.But even though there's so much bad, there are some good. Great information for kids, a lot of exhibits where you're literally up close to the animals, and new exhibits that comes out regularly (i've seen the jelly fish and the sea horses), and there are a lot of cute amazing animals... even though I've seen them before in other places. Overall, I think the only people who may get their money's worth at this place are people who are not native Californians and elementary/middle school kids and parents. I won't be coming back here any time soon because right now, I really don't enjoy family places. Perhaps it'll be more worth it when I have my own family."
3960,2009-08-25,4,"On the last day of our trip, we decided to go to the aquarium before our drive back to L.A. We parked five to ten blocks away, parking is expensive here and i hate having to pay for parking at all. We got there when they had just opened. We walked every corner of this place. This aquarium is definitely worth coming to. We were a bit hesitant to come because of our experience from the Long Beach Aquarium. This place is 500 times better. We spent a good five hours just wondering around and we didn't have time to watch all the shows or lectures they had. So if you have the time, spend the whole day here."
3961,2009-10-12,5,"First time ever, and I have been to this lil museum ( yeah right heard about it since i was 15). It was a lil steep for the entrance, but the jellyfish, massive tuna, otters and penguins was worth every penny. By the way, the bat manta rays are slimy feeling when u you touch them in the wade pool area. An expensive treat, but worth coming back every few years. Can't wait to comeback with a little one of my own, to show him/her how awesome it was. One of the few things in California you should not miss!"
3962,2009-11-15,5,We have been to alot of aquarium's and this is the biggest i believe and the best location. You can sit outside and relax and check out the ocean. There is alot of people here and is very crowded and lots of activities and things for the kids. It would have been better if it wasnt so crowded.
3963,2012-11-11,4,I wish I didn't finish looking at the exhibit within two hours for the price I paid. Sea otters were under construction too. The sea life was nevertheless amazing. Parking sucks!
3964,2010-07-16,3,"I love aquariums, so not too much can get me down about them except not having DOLPHINS OR WHALES. Who comes to see a bunch of fish and jellyfish. Its all about the dolphins people.....I am all for establishments not ""buying"" dolphins for peoples enjoyment and, saving them, for one reason or another so this may be the case here. Whats here is beautiful and well done. There was a nice children's play area and a gorgeous display of jellyfish upstairs.I enjoyed seeing each penguin tagged with playful names and the Whole Foods event outside was interesting. This aquarium has a lovely view of the Pacific also. The $30.00 price tag per person was extortion. I live in Chicago and the Shedd is twice as big and more enjoyable and cheaper.....as well as the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific at $18pp....and that one is top notch as well."
3965,2010-08-27,4,"Really nice aquarium, but it is super busy and expensive. Our 2 year old loves it!We purchased the annual membership which is partly tax deductible and so far have been pretty happy with the decision."
3966,2011-04-11,1,"Best to save your dollars and spend it on seafood. We felt that $30 was a lot to charge so see sea horses, otters, penguins, and jellyfish. Our group left very disappointed. The ocean life here is very limited and a lot of the space is filled with wall art and videos. More suitable for children than for the young professional."
3967,2010-03-13,5,"What an amazing, interactive tribute to Neptune's kingdom! Highlights include the 90-year-old lobster in the starfish petting zoo, the otters, the scuba diving exposition (when it's not suffering from microphone difficulties), the shark tank, the octopi, the coral reef wave simulation, and, most of all, the justifiably ballyhooed sea horse exhibit, the camouflage of some of whose creatures defies the imagination."
3968,2012-01-03,4,"I really wanted to enjoy the aquarium, but we went on a holiday weekday thinking it wouldn't be too bad, crowd wise... we were sorely mistaken! Parking and walking there a couple blocks wasn't too bad, once we approach the aquarium we saw a huge line that wrapped around the side of the building. We overheard people saying it would be about a 10 min wait, but it was about 7 mins for us, the line moved quickly into the admission area. Once inside, crowded was an understatement, more like packed like a can of sardines. I suggest in the colder months dressing in layers, because once inside with all those other bodies surrounding you, it gets really really hot! To view anything in the crowded viewing section, we sorta had a ""technique"" to get closer in. We waited behind as closely as we could (without being disrepectful ofcourse), kept a close eye out for someone next to the glass to leave, and swiftly maneuver our way in to stake our claim of the prize view. We really wanted our young son to see most of the aquarium, so it didn't matter if we did or not. However, my husband and I were on high alert and anxiety the whole time. Some areas were really dark, you could lose your little guy in an instant amidst the crowds if you're not aware. (My husband even considered putting our son in one of those embarrasing child leashes.) Regardless of the crowds, our family did have a good time from what we did get a chance to see, using the technique above. We loved the jellyfish, the open sea exhibit, the wave crash, and the touch pools. My son spent a long time in the touch pool, and got we even got to touch a sea cucumber, it was an interestingly squishy. Before leaving we indulged ourselves at the gift shop, so many cute things for kids there. We didn't get a chance to check out the cafe, since there were waves of people going in and out. Oh well, maybe next time. I'm almost tempted to take my son out of school purposely on a random non holiday weekday, to give him the opportunity to get a real appreciation of this place. Overall a very nice all inclusive aquarium, you get to see a lot of sea life there for your money's worth."
3969,2006-09-25,5,"mmm, lots and lots of fish. that's aquariums for ya. one thing i would add, that i haven't seen mentioned here, is that the little exhibit on cannery row itself inside the aquarium, detailing the history of the fishing industry and the town is really rather good. small, compact and interesting. and they have a steam whistle that you can pull and it makes a steam-whistly noise. cool."
3970,2006-12-26,5,"Sweet jellyfish exhibit and the shark/tuna feeding is quite a sight. Plan to arrive early when it first opens so you can at least make your way to the touching pools. Otherwise, its daycare city as you spend the whole time dodging children (ugh!) which ruins the whole thing."
3971,2007-08-11,2,"This place really dashed my idealistic hopes... its performance overall screams ""I need some razzle dazzle."" I can't believe I wasted an April Spring Break day here... it's not very entertaining... maybe for kids and seniors and families, but I'm a middle aged spirit, what do you expect?"
3972,2007-10-01,3,"Pretty awesome place, words like mind-blowing comes to mind. If you haven't been there you will absolutely love these high class exhibits. Too bad a family of four would have to fork out $100 for a visit, minus 1 to 2 stars for that, not sure if it is worth it."
3973,2008-04-18,5,"This place is fabulous, I can stare at any aquarium for hours. Although I still can't decide whether it is humane to have 'em fish in there, sighs. This place is so nice tho, one time I attended a private reception there at night and basically have the whole place for our own group, YAY..... I love this place. On top of it they do a lot of research..."
3974,2008-06-03,5,"This place has changed so much since the last time I was here (maybe 12 years ago).  Absolutely loved it... I would have to agree with others that the Jelly Fish exhibit is amazing.  I also loved the Octopus which according to his handler usually does not come out of its hiding spot during the day... actually performed this whole dance for us, swimming back and forth, climbing all over... it was the coolest thing I have ever seen.  Also, don't forget to check out the Sea Dragon/Seahorse tank... those little creators are also very neat.The new Splash Zone for kids kept the little cheese busy for about 30 minutes when we finally dragged him out of there. Overall a great experience and you definitely need a full day to go through it all.For food I recommend the Portola Cafe (I think it was called, the sit down Restaurant not self serve).  The food was a little pricey but the service is wonder and the food is incredible.  The best Lobster Bisque I have ever had."
3975,2008-08-11,5,"Love it!  I have been twice and will certainly go again.  Make sure to go early to the sea otter feeding (the viewing area up above is the best spot, but it gets crowded).  If you can't deal with the crowds there then head over to the jellies and I swear you can feel your blood pressure drop.  I can't get over how relaxing it is to watch them."
3976,2008-09-12,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is such a treat!  We spent a good 6 or 7 hours there over the course of 2 days and I could have spent more time if I had it.  The exhibits are all amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying to catch a couple of the feeding shows, especially for the otters.  Make sure you take a map and try to see everything!  They have also recently remodeled the splash zone for kids and it was a lot of fun.  They have lots of creatures to touch and everything throughout the entire aquarium is accessible to the little ones.  Our very tiny 2-year-old was able to see and enjoy all of it.  We saw a little play on reducing energy use and it was cheesy, but our little girl loved it.  I wish we lived closer and could go to the aquarium all the time!  It is so much fun!"
3977,2008-12-02,5,The best time to go to the aquarium is as soon as it opens 10 am. No ankle biters or screaming babies to tarnish the experience of the peacefully floating jellies or the swiftness of the serrated back tuna. I was able to walk up to the glass and watch an otter gracefully arch its back to catch its sardine breakfast. I stood in awe as a school of sardines made a tornado like spiral and flashed silver in unision. MBA never ceases to amaze me. :)
3978,2009-01-08,3,"We take the kids every year...  This year the crowds were even worse than usual...couldn't really get close to anything.  We stayed a the Victorian Inn and bought our tickets there - they were 2 days for the price of one and apparently had last years prices of $24.95 for adults and $15.95 for kids...which was an added bonus...but this year the aquarium was seriously almost too crowded to enjoy.  Everything there is absolutely amazing, but we were thinking they made the jellyfish exhibit smaller...  It is an amazing place and worth a visit, but try and see if you can pick an off season time to check it..."
3979,2009-03-30,4,My first time here in like 10+ years I think!  I dont really remember when I came here as a kid so it was like a brand new experience!  I love the sea otters!  They are so cute and playful.  I wish I could have taken one home with me!  I also liked the dragon seahorse.  It was really pretty.  The penguins are cute too and touching the stingray was great.  The jellyfish are very photogenic!  Is it bad that the big tuna swimming around makes me think of sushi?
3980,2009-05-15,5,"This place is the BEST! I LOVE everything aquariums! You can't go wrong spending at least half a day at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and spend the other half walking around the city learning about the canning history of the area. My favorite were the otters! My wife and I bought an otter Christmas tree ornament to support their cause! You will definitely enjoy your time here, even if you don't have a lot of time to spend. Can't get enough? You can become an Aquarium member and receive discount tickets and gift store discounts!"
3981,2009-05-31,4,"Very simply, a great day out with the kids. Superb aquarium - our kids especially enjoyed the amazing jellyfish and sea-horse exhibits. Leave some time to go strolling through the marina afterwards, you may catch a glimpse of some cute sea-otters or the many seals that laze around the jetties. Nice day out for the family."
3982,2009-08-18,4,"LOVE it HERE! I've been coming here for YEARS and years... since elementary school and I'm like an grannie now. Even came here for one of my UCSC courses. LOVED the ""Secret Lives of Seahorses"" exhibition. Sometimes I catch a great glimpse of a/the sea turtle and sometimes not, but when I do it's makes being a vegetarian ALL WORTH IT. =) Oh and you can't forget about the super cutesy little otters, that look like water friendly cats. LOVE their little touchpool, I'm like a 5 year old when it comes to it. I will touch EVERYTHING, from the sea stars to the sea anemones. JUST try to drag me away, I DARE you. Of course it gets pretty crowded on the weekend and it may not be the cheapest place to visit, but COME ON ppl PLEASE show your support for the marine life. =)"
3983,2009-10-27,4,One of the best places to go in Monterey; however some of the exhibits were closed while we were out there this weekend. Other than the downside it is one of the best places to take pictures and also get to know more of the creatures in the sea.
3984,2010-01-04,5,"How could I not give this place 5 stars? I won't bore you with my account of everything I love here, but I honestly do believe this place has something for everyone. It's even great for senior citizens...the MBA has wheelchairs you can use! Although I don't have kids of my own, kids of all ages seem to be delighted here. My husband came here to celebrate his 31st birthday, and if you come on your birthday and tell the information desk, they give you a happy birthday button with your name on it, a Penguin window decal and a free paper bookmark. Yup, even for 31 year olds!The aquarium strikes a nice balance between education and entertainment. All the displays are strikingly beautiful, and there is information to read and learn without it being overwhelming or tiring. I really love that they advocate for  sustainable fishing.  They help you make smarter decisions on which seafood to eat in an interesting and creative way. Their exhibit with the video screens and touch screen ""menus"" are pure genius.  During this last visit, I heard one of the presenters say you could get a free ""Seafood Watch"" app for your iPhone. I downloaded it on the spot and am happy to try and make better choices on the go.To make the most of your visit, buy your tickets online so you don't have to wait in line to buy them. Try and get there early so you can catch all the feedings, too. They say most visitors get through the aquarium in 2 1/2 to 3 hours, but it always takes me an entire day if I want to do it at my own rate. The Monterey Bay Aquarium really is the best aquarium I have ever visited, and if you come to Monterey without making time for this place, you're a fool!"
3985,2011-09-20,3,overcrowded with tourists in the tight space. not very well ventilated resulting in humid and smelly conditions. ticket price not worth the crowd and the size of aquarium. jellyfish exhibit was the only redeeming factor. Chicago and Boston beat out Monterey by a LONG shot
3986,2010-08-02,5,A must-see when u come to Monterey... One of the best aquariums in the world
3987,2010-03-28,5,"Not to be missed if you have 5 and 4 year old boys!  It is very cool and interactive for this age group, but the adults enjoyed it too.  Don't miss the sea horses, jellyfish, or kelp forest."
3988,2010-03-21,4,Very nice aquarium in Monterey that emphasizes how to be good steward  to the ocean by eating the right fish.Two minor complaints:1) They don't have a tunnel to walk through that is surrounded by water.  An aquarium in Oregon has this feature and it really is breathtaking.2) You cannot get to the gift shop without a ticket.  That is a bad decision since it makes it impossible to buy items from the store if you are not a member or do not want to pay to get in.Monterey County Resident tip -- go to the library and ask for a free pass.  It is good for 6 people and valid for a month.
3989,2011-06-06,5,"World-class aquarium, unlike any other I've been to (but I haven't been to many... so my frame of reference is small!).  It's easy to spend a day here with family or friends.  Parking is simple and inexpensive in garages located within walking distance.  Admission is $30 for adults and they offer a $2 discount for students - seems steep but worth every penny.  Amazing exhibits where one seems to outdo the next!  Penguins, flamingos, giant octopus, and sharks just to name a few!Jellyfish exhibit - For me, this was definitely the star of the show.  Beautifully showcased with luminous lighting, this display made the creatures seem otherworldly.  I can't see how anyone could rush through this section.Seahorse gallery - As you go through this part of the aquarium, you can't help but to notice people's ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" and proclamations that there were creatures they've ""never seen before"".  Definitely awe-inducing with endless encasements.Touchpools - The most interactive part of the aquarium!  Anyone can descend upon these pools and find out for yourself what a starfish/sea cucumber/crab/sea urchin feels like.  Perfect for all ages.Kelp forest - An impressive view of ocean creatures with a mile-high window to the sea.  You can also catch scuba divers swimming down below for feedings at 11:30 and 4:00 every day!"
3990,2012-10-27,4,"In the past, I have visited the aquarium's in San Diego and Long Beach, but when we arrived to Monterey Bay Aquarium, it was a whole new experience!  Definitely more expansive than other aquariums, offering many more exhibits and areas to view.  This place is huge and will take the average person atleast 2 or more hours to see.  I have great video of this and plan to share it.  I love the part where the waves crash over a glass tunnel to demonstrate how waves are formed in the ocean.  Also, the sea turtles were just amazing!  I had the fortunate experience of having my picture taken while the sea turtle was swimming along the glass aligned perfectly to the side of me.  Most of all the exhibits were never boring, yet fun and/or educational.  This is definitely to ""go-to"" aquarium!"
3991,2010-03-05,5,"So you want to be an underwater photographer, eh? Ok, well maybe you don't, but you can certainly fake out a lot of your friends by taking your camera to The Monterey Bay Aquarium! My rating is specifically based on three -nesses - cleanliness, friendliness, and informativeness... ok, and sheer jaw-dropping  awesomeness would make it 4. Seriously - leafy seadragons! Wowie!Now I've been to a fair amount of aquariums in the US, but THIS aquarium is in my top 3 for certain - and lucky me, it's local! Gorgeous, as anyone will tell you, it has the feel of being brand new because they keep it in such pristine condition. Even with a shortage of active sea otters to fawn over, a feeding-time diver with a torn dry-suit seal, and too many screaming children to wag every single finger on you and your partner's hands at, it was unforgettable, as always. When my boyfriend and I found ourselves questioning things aloud (""I wonder what happened to the two Sunfish they used to have?""), their super-nice staff would chime in with the answers we were seeking (""One of them was re-released back into the wild, and the other passed away""). Their signage is very helpful and informative at each and every turn. The soundtrack is all watery flutes and strings, and their programs will answer any question you might have (including how to become a volunteer for the Otter Care exhibit, or a diver in the kelp forest tanks). It's located on the incredible Monterey Bay - with a nice clear sunny day like the one we had, it's tough to beat such a trip. I had such a great time, and got a membership for myself for my birthday. Can't wait to go back."
3992,2006-07-06,3,I went here hung over and probably partially drunk the day after a wedding in Carmel.  Maybe not the smartest idea considering it was a sunday afternoon on 4th of July weekend but that being said....the aquarium deserves 3 stars for the fish.  Maybe it deserves more but I couldn't get over the enormous crowds nor the raging headache I had.  It turned out to be a beautiful day but I could only handle bout an hour of the madness before it was time to engorge on greasy foods and gallons of water to soak up and replenish all the nutrients lossed the previous evening.  I will say the penguins were cool...they posed for pictures...it was kind of hilarious.
3993,2007-01-21,5,"This is more fun than sea world!  I told my bf, we have to go there once we get to Cali."
3994,2007-01-26,5,"I ""heart"" the aquarium.  It's one of my fav places in Cali.  Jeff and I spent 3.5 hours there and I could have spent another year!  Looking forward to the new otter exhibit."
3995,2007-07-29,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a must see for those with small children.  The kid's section will have your little ones entertained for hours.  We bought a membership in Oct 06 and have used it the most when relatives visit.  I heard that the Monterey Library offers a free group pass for up to six people each month for library members.  I recently heard this rumor from my neighbor, so it might be worth checking out.  The Aquarium obviously isn't advertising this deal because they would lose quite a bit of money.  Either way, the Monterey Aquarium is a great time for friends and family."
3996,2007-09-02,4,"This is a great aquarium! The Kelp Forest, Outer Bay and jellyfish exhibits are my favorites. The only problem is it sucks in the summer with all the summer camp kids. If you go in the morning during the school year, though, it's much more relaxed and you can take your time wandering through."
3997,2007-12-23,5,"makes me hungry for sushi.what?! it does! and thanks to the helpful guides, i know what and what not to order. i absolutely adore this place and actually bought a membership while i was at school across the bay in santa cruz where i was able to attend special events and think about spacing out in front of the outer bay tank and just watch the sharks and sun fish swim in and out of view. i always toyed with the idea of studying for finals there but never made it- one of my regrets...dam sorority! one of the special perks for getting a membership is the privilege to visit the aquarium at night with no crowds. i remember attending one where you were able to either have dinner in front of the various tanks or just come for desserts and sip on wine as you stroll from exhibit to exhibit. ah yes, i remember now, it was for valentines day. they had caricature artists too and other people to make love day a bit more special as guides talked about how the fishes fall in love too. how cute is that?!i just went there again and was elated to see the third white shark they have on display (i've been lucky to have seen 2 out of 3). this place is great for adults with inquisitive minds and questions like the kids- i think i spent a good 20mins talking to a guide asking him:""why is the aquarium calling the shark a 'white shark' and not a GREAT white? is it only a 'good"" white shark until he proves himself?""I knew the answer of course, but it was fun to see the reaction and how they were able to play along while educating you. I was pretty bummed that the reef exhibit was closed for remodeling since the leafy dragons are one of my favorites to see but everything was made up for with the new 'wild about otters' exhibit. there, you can sit on the floor and just watch the otters from around the world play and frolick as you fantasize about coming up with a grand plan to distract the workers and sneak your way into the exhibit to play with one... my plan didn't quite work out all the kinks but maybe yours will? =)everyone is friendly, helpful and happy to make your visit an enjoyable experience. i really need to renew my membership and take that trip one of these days where i just park in front of the tank and think- how life is great at this one moment in time."
3998,2008-09-29,5,"This place is a oasis of sooth-ness. Watching the jellyfish for 2 minutes will free your body of months of stress. Relaxing with the giant fish bowl filled with various sharks, barracudas, dolphin fish (yeah, right), and lots of other sea life that you won't see without a scuba suit is just plain wonderful. They even had a touch-me tank with manta rays (yes, the stingers were removed for your protection). And the otters...are you kidding. They are like fun dogs that swim with tails. I wanted to go play fetch with them all day. The only thing that I didn't like about this place is that it had to close, because I could have stayed there all day and through the night. Totally worth ever single dollar (and more). A must see if you are in Monterey."
3999,2009-05-30,5,"Over the years, the Monterey Bay Aquarium has gotten better and better.  The new seahorse exhibit is simply amazing.  The place can get crowded, so go early and get over to the Outer Bay side as soon as it opens, or wait until later in the day, when most of the kids are gone.  Too bad MBA had to decrease part of the jellyfish exhibit, as I'm sure space is limited.  I really enjoy the Out Bay side with its newer exhibits and tanks.  My son had such a great time seeing all of the colorful sea life, even though he is only 13 months old.One drawback is the crowd of people who do not follow the rules, especially with flash photography.  The MBA staff are extremely polite in giving friendly reminders, but even then, they don't catch each and every one of the flash photographers.  Another drawback are the people who do not leave their strollers in the stroller park taking up precious space in the darkened hallways of the exhibits.  Oh well that is life in public venues."
4000,2009-10-29,5,The Monterey Bay Aquarium ROCKS my socks!!!! Can i buy a seahorse to take home? Oh no:( awwww
4001,2010-01-17,3,"I love this aquarium. Our daughter just loved it here last year. I think it cost us about $60 for the three of us which is insane but we're rarely down that way so I said ""what the heck""."
4002,2010-02-02,5,Secret lives of seahorses was my favorite part of any aquarium that I have EVER been to!  Harbor seals and/or sea lions out and about in the waters outside of the Aquarium....There was a line to get in - I bet it is always busy.  This might be the best aquarium on the planet!
4003,2011-04-04,5,"I HAVE to come here every single time I visit my boyfriend's family in Norcal. This is one of my favorite places in the whole world, and I can get lost in there forever. Every single exhibit is clean and amazing to look at. This place is huge compared to Aquarium of the Pacific in LB. There's an enormous variety of aquatic organisms here and it's such a visual pleasure! My favorite is the sunfish (SUNFISH!!!), but unfortunately, he's been out sick the past 2 times I've come. =( The kelp forest tank is amazing and I love watching the seaweed sway with the current and the schools of fish weaving and reflecting through the water. They've got a section for polar bears too (that's already a +5 in my book!). The sea turtles are so fun to see, it's completely up close and personal, and they swim right up to your hand on the glass. The penguin/otter feedings are very entertaining to watch and the otters obviously enjoy the crowds because they're constantly interacting with the people through the glass. If you're in Norcal and you've got time, please visit the aquarium!"
4004,2011-01-23,5,"First of all its pretty pricey but you get your moneys worth.So many different fish,mammals etc.The seahorse exibit was awesome.This place is pretty deceving because it looks somewhat small from the outside but as you go from exibit to exibit you realize how big it is.I like the fact that there are places you can actually touch the starfish,sea cucumber etc.This place is for kids and adults..the staff is also very friendly helpful and insightful.Parking around the aquirium is like 5 dollars all day so its cheap compared to LA parking.If your in monterey the aqurium is a must"
4005,2008-03-02,3,"i wasn't very smart and visited this place on a holiday. it was horribly packed and there was a long line out the door just to get in. being that i'm not very interested in aquariums as others are, i felt this aquarium was very nice and i could see why people like it. my favorite exhibit was looking for the shark in this huge tank. my only complaint is really the price. i think i paid around $20 with my student discount."
4006,2008-05-23,5,Fantastic new second floor kids' section. This is only my second visit here and I really can't complain about the price as well as the friendly staff. I really enjoyed how friendly and knowledgeable the staff are with the displays. They (the staff) are eager to answer any questions regarding the displays and wildlife seen in the aquarium. Little kids really will have a great time and I recommend this place to anyone with children. The price is also very reasonable.
4007,2008-08-05,5,"What can I add that no one else has? The kids loved it so much, we're members now! They couldn't stop yelling ""Fish! Fish!"" at every exhibit, and I couldn't tear my oldest away from the touch pond. The jellyfish exhibit was even more beautiful than I remembered- it will be closing in September, I believe. If you have kids, please tell them to be aware of other kids in the splash zone play area-  I saw my son fall head over heels down the steps of the tree-house like structure and my dad swears someone knocked him down. Sad and scary for me/us, but we'll be back!"
4008,2009-05-31,4,A must see if you're in Monterey.  Lots of interactive hands on activities.
4009,2009-09-21,4,I would definitely come back on a weekday. I guess I chose to go on the last day of the seahorse exhibit and that was a bad idea. I felt like a sardine in that area of the museum. Extra 1/2 star for putting the kid stuff into one corner so I don't have to run over screaming kids who wanted to touch everything in sight. Great exhibits for a pretty decent price. Still not as good as the Long Beach Aquarium but I wouldn't mind coming back here again.
4010,2012-07-31,4,A good time had by all.  A great experience overall.  I would skip the private family tour on the weekends.  It really wasn't worth the money and didn't add anything to the experience.
4011,2012-04-08,2,"If you live close enough to get a pass it might be worth it but if you are visiting from somewhere else I don't think it is worth the money. At $32.00 an adult it is a little steep for what it provides their otters are supposed to be amazing but they have a much better exhibit in Oregon. The sea horses were the best exhibit IMO.    Furthermore, kids (5,7,8)  were fairly bored  with the hordes of people and limited visibility and with parking and admission for me husband,kids we were at $175.00 which was disappointing. Meanwhile, bought the City Pass in San Francisco for $260 for  all of us that included 6 attractions including the bay aquarium(smaller but less crowded) and California Science center which family enjoyed more."
4012,2012-01-16,4,"My husband, father and I went to the aquarium on a weekday during the second week of December. It was the only time in the past ten years that I actually felt relaxed and was able to enjoy all the exhibits without having to elbow my way past hordes of unsupervised children who out of excitement during school field trips have no consciousness of other people. Instead, I was able to spend time viewing the exhibits  for more than 2 minutes before an obnoxious parent knocked me out of the way to take a picture of their 3 month old child next to an otter. I believe the aquarium either needs to limit the amount of people who attend per day or let people know before they buy their tickets when more than 2 school buses full of kids below the age of 11 are at the aquarium. I absolutely love this aquarium, but go when you'd least expect bus loads of school field trips and if you can find a time other than the weekend to go, you will have a much better time."
4013,2014-05-12,5,"I was here with my sister, niece and grand nephew (6yrs old).  We purchased tickets in advance so we were able to walk right in without standing in line.  The volunteers are everywhere and extremely knowledgeable about the exhibits.  With their help we took full advantage of the cool activities that my grand nephew loved, i.e. drawing your own neon jelly fish and saving it on line, the open sea feeding frenzy (super cool).  Their is so much to see.  The volunteers and workers helped to make this a memorable experience.  We left without having the chance to visit the gift shop.  The next morning we were leaving town and were a little disappointed we didn't buy anything to remember the occasion.  My sister and I walked back to the aquarium and explained our situation to one of the workers.  They had someone personally walk us throughout the different gift shops and help us pick out souvenirs.  Totally awesome!  They were soooooo nice.  I love this place!"
4014,2012-01-25,5,"Unless you're willing to travel to Japan, Spain, or Georgia, you wont find much better. This place is one of the premier aquariums in the world. Anyone who finds themselves in Monterey and doesn't go here is insane."
4015,2006-08-17,5,This is an incredible aquarium.  You can spend almost an entire day here.  I love the jelly exhibit.
4016,2009-03-07,5,I love the aquarium.  I am a member and learn something new everytime I go there.
4017,2009-09-19,5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Anytime we bring guests to Monterey, we go here. Years ago, my then-18 month-old son was having a meltdown during our aquarium visit. A common occurrence with kids this age. Carrying him into the entrance to the Outer Bay exhibit--the area with the sardines swimming in a huge ring--calmed him down immediately. He couldn't stop staring, wide-eyed, at the shining fish, and his crying stopped. Four years later, on another visit, we entered the Outer Bay exhibit, and upon walking into the entrance area with the sardines, he said ""I remember this place!!"" So this aquarium makes an indelible impression on children and adults alike. Don't miss it! If you stay at one of the local hotels, you can get two-day tickets from the hotel concierge--great if you are traveling with children and want to stretch your visit out over two, more manageable, days."
4018,2012-01-22,5,"Love love love this place. I can't go within 100 miles without making a side trip here. And when I'm back in Austin and missing the otters, I can watch them on the webcam to tide me (no pun intended) over till the next time I'm within 100 miles."
4019,2010-05-29,4,"I love the aquarium! I had the privilege of seeing the great white shark here a couple of years ago too. My young daughter's eyes light up when she sees all the colorful fish and the play and discover area for kids is a nice touch. The only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is because in the bathrooms they have a sign on the paper towels stating ""Paper towels kill trees"" (or something to that extent) and they make you feel guilty, but there is no air dryer! If you're going to put a sign like that up at least have an alternative way to dry your hands. Sheesh!"
4020,2011-11-16,5,"I have been a member of Monterey Bay Aquarium several years in a row and I find that they just keep making it better.  The jelly fish exhibit is maigcal, watching these seemingly alien creatures floating around in the dim blue light is something special.  I just love the seeing the large kelp forest move organically in the diffused sunlight, it is a perfect recreation of life in the Monterey Bay kelp Forests.  For those that don't dive this is a place to see what you are missing!  I was in awe the first time I saw a great white shark in the huge outer bay exhibit, for those who don't know this is just not done ANYWHERE else in the world.  Great whites don't do well in captivity and aside from the most recent GW shark that died after release they have been incredibly lucky to have 6 of these magnificent creatures on display over the last few years and have been released back into the wild.  The MB aquarium is one of my very favorite places, the attention to detail here and the obvious care and professionalism of the curators is 2nd to none.  This is a world class aquarium and worth a visit!"
4021,2010-05-22,5,"Beyond the extraordinary job the MBA has done with their inventory and displays, is the remarkable training of the staff and volunteers.  While it is easy to become engrossed in the delight of all there is to see and miss it,  the experience is enhanced by the helpful, always upbeat, pleasant and knowledgeable Aquarium personnel.  And the cleanliness... like being in Switzerland."
4022,2012-03-17,5,"Worth the money! Amazing aquarium, the otters are adorable and the jellyfish exhibit was the coolest."
4023,2010-05-14,4,Outstanding aquarium. What else is there to say. Only one bad thing is that we live in the east bay and have to drive over an hour to get to Monterey.
4024,2007-01-21,5,"My favorite place in the world,...so far. I love it here. The sea life is amazing.  Actually the Sunfish (Mola mola) was there on Friday. If you like  fish and Aquariums look up tetrodotoxin. My favorite animals have it...The puffer, the mola, the blue ringed octopus."
4025,2009-04-05,4,"Havent been here since 1985 - it has expanded and added new exhibits -WOW!! Had a great time looking at all the exhibits, learning more about the penguins, otters and jellyfish.  Would recomment it to friends and family visiting the Monterey/Carmel area."
4026,2009-10-30,5,"Spectacular!  We visited for the 6th time and we were still thrilled.  This was the first weekday visit and we enjoyed the fact it was not so crowded.Many of the exhibit makes me think about my seafood consumption...Although I will not give up seafood, I may have a hard time eating octopus from now on after reading that it is actually really nice creature and it has personality.....!Jelly fish section was beautiful!"
4027,2009-11-25,5,"This is the place you should take a date to.  I took my girlfriend here on our second date and it was one of the best ideas I ever had.  We had a great time looking at different fishes, sea creatures, birds, cute otters and so much more.  The time we spent here was great, we had a blast just walking around and having fun.  The aquarium was much more than your typical dinner and a movie.  Not to mention it being romantic being by the ocean.  The gigantic aquarium made was mind blowing.  The fishes that looks like a face was kind of creepy though.  Definitely will be coming back."
4028,2009-12-25,5,"Been to aquariums in Sydney, San Francisco, Long Beach, Cairns and a few others. This makes them all look like a gold fish bowl by comparison. Extraordinary place for children and adults. Everyone raves about the jellyfish, but check out the sea horse exhibit. It's like watching ballet under water. Amazing place."
4029,2011-09-25,5,"I came here years ago as a child in the mid 80's and was just back here this past Friday with my nise who loved it so much.  She was in awe at everything, constantly telling us to come here, there, and everywhere to see all the various exhibits.  This definitely brought back a lot of memories of seeing all the jelly fish, sharks,, star fish, and so forth.  She loved her camera from the gift shop; I don't think she will ever forget her trip here as I will always remember mine.  Keep up the good work guys.!"
4030,2013-12-27,5,best aquarium i've visited. it was fun for the whole family. age range of 18 mo to 10 yrs old and everyone had a good time. plenty of unique sealife to see and activities for kids. worth the trip and the price of admission.  very crowded so buy tickets online in advance and skip the line.
4031,2011-03-09,5,"If you are visiting the Monterey Peninsula you must visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Their exhibits are wonderful. There are volunteer guides throughout the aquarium to answer any questions you have.  If you are hungry, the Portola Cafe has lots of choices. There are four gift stores within the aquarium so am sure you will find a keepsake to remember your day at this amazing institution."
4032,2011-02-18,5,"Saw flamingos, penguins, beautiful outdoor views of the bay. Simply the best aquarium I've ever visited. Wish price admission were cheaper, though, since I only spend a few hours there at a time! It is once every 5-10 years, however, so it's worth it."
4033,2010-11-03,5,While going to school at Monterey High I did an internship at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I must say this place is spectacular. I attended countless field trips and then worked there for a while. It's amazing and their exhibits are always so well informative and well put together. I think this aquarium is so valuable and I'm pleased to have been able to grow up near such a resource. I will continue to visit because there's always something new to see and learn.
4034,2011-05-11,4,"This is probably one of the nicer aquariums that I have been to.  Having said that...why 4 stars instead of 5?  The price.  We paid $25 (military discount) and I still felt that the whole place didn't justify such a hefty price tag.  The layout of the aquarium is really nice and I love the fact that it's on the shore (major photo-op), but the exhibits are pretty limited (place is small).  The exhibits that they do have are beautiful though.  My favorites are the kelp forest (felt like you were immersed in the ocean), and the seahorse exhibit (baby seahorses are too cute).  The penguins totally milked the crowd...they were swimming towards the windows as the aquarium goers snapped away on their cameras.  This aquarium is definitely catered more towards the kiddies: multiple touch pools and hands on activity areas.  My only disappointment with my visit is that I didn't get to see the giant sun fish!  I probably would not return again, but it is must go at least once."
4035,2010-04-21,5,"Great place to spend the day. The place is beautiful and well maintained. Their jellyfish collection is the best I've ever seen. Other unique exhibits include the giant multistory kelp forest and another big enough to house actual tuna. If you like aquariums, this is a must see!"
4036,2007-08-03,5,"It doesn't matter how old you are, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is an amazing place to spend your day. It is an exciting facility in one of my favorite areas to visit. My parents took me here on our vacations to the Monterey Bay area (Monterey, Carmel, Pacific Grove) when I was younger, and I have returned several times with friends in the past few years. Each part of the aquarium catches my attention. I always find myself mesmerized by the all the sharks, fish, jellyfish, etc. in the Outer Bay exhibit. The jellyfish exhibits are beautiful and peaceful...the Splash Zone is so cute and definitely a favorite with children...and anything with otters gets my attention for a long time. The touch pools are so fun too! The Aquarium is crazy on the weekend, so go on a weekday if you can."
4037,2009-07-26,4,"Only decent aquarium accessible from the SF Bay Area.  Good enough that I bought a yearly membership pass for the family.  But lately they seem to be ratcheting up the enviro-hippie guilt-tripping.  Tone it down folks.  I love fishes, in my sushi."
4038,2009-09-21,5,"Absolutely wonderful as always. Crowded on the weekends but a little patience is helpful and you will get to see all the wonderful exhibits. The Outer Bay is mesmerizing, especially with the Great White they have now and the Sun Fish. As a local you can get in free on the 20th of each month as they gear up towards the 25 year anniversary."
4039,2009-10-29,5,"I believe Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the Best Aquariums in the US. The aquarium has many excellent exhibits to enjoy the afternoon and it's a great learning experience for for all ages. Especially, the seahorse and jellyfish exhibits are both incredible. If you are in the area,  this is a really good attraction worth a visit."
4040,2011-10-12,4,"pros: HUGE tanks - 1.2 million gallons of water which have 3 levels of views! and lots to see.cons: it's located on Cannery Row of Monterey which is a shameless tourist-trap - $20+ parking, $10 frozen sandwiches, and lots of overpriced unattractive food/suvenirs and takes a long time to get in/out.try enter from the ""ticket purchase"" room and just make an immediate right turn into the aquarium to avoid paying any fee. we bought the tickets and there wasn't even any guard by the entrances checking. the worst case they tell you to go buy tickets."
4041,2009-07-19,5,"I have gone here so many times and even if it's the same, I am always amazed.They added a great and interesting sea horse display in April 09.It was such an amazing experience to see it.I highly recommend this place for families with children.  It is very fun."
4042,2009-08-25,5,"There really are not enough words to describe this aquarium. What is amazing is the excitement and happiness you see on everyones faces there. Young and old, from every part of the world. It's a awesome environment inside and out and has a magical way of making all those experiencing it.... feel good and care free!"
4043,2011-08-14,4,"A wondeful place to go. They recently reopened the ""Outer Bay"" which is now called the ""Open Ocean."" Sunfish is still there. The jellyfish and seahorse exhibits are cool. They have a great program for kids 8 - 13 called Underwater Explorers. If you can afford it, it's a wonderful experience for surface scuba diving in the Great Tidepool. They also have a scuba program for special needs kids called Day of Discovery that happens several times during the summer. Need to pre-register for that in February."
4044,2011-07-02,4,so much fun! we came during the 4th of july weekend...and it was packed...prolly would come on an off season or later in the day to experience it more intimately instead of dodging strollers and kids.
4045,2011-11-02,2,"I like the animals, but they charge an arm and a leg for admission, and nearly every exhibit is riddled with subliminal  ""save the environment/sea/marine life"" messages. I don't like being preached at by someone with a hidden agenda...so don't expect to see me there again."
4046,2011-08-23,4,"I would give this place 5 stars for cleanliness and staff. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. However, I'm not a fan of the layout, I think it's kind of confusing and easy to miss certain attractions, and there doesn't seem to be any ""flow"". Also, I thought most of the exhibits were on the small side. I was expecting more large sea life for the amount you pay to get in. I did enjoy the large tank that held the sea turtles and the sunfish, but it was hard to get to see some things because it was so crowded and the viewing windows were small. The jellyfish room was incredible"
4047,2005-12-29,5,"Tickets are $22, and you are best advised to buy them in advance, unless you want to wait in line with all the other clueless plebes! And anyways, who doesn't like walking right past a line and entering like the VIP that you are?! Parking is $0.75 per 30 min, but it should come out to about $5 unless you really stay there a long time. The tanks with the tuna (they're gigantic! all I could think about while looking at them was sushi....), the sunfish (it's back, or they got another one), and the sea tortoise are great, as are the jellyfish, penguins, sea otters, and sharks. The octopus doesn't come out too much, unless you get lucky. Oh, this place is very crowded with tourists and kids! Get there early in the morning when they open at 10AM, or be prepared to deal. And don't eat anywhere nearby! For dinner, go to Stokes, they have a great prix fixe between 5 and 6:30PM, for $19.95, $5 more for 4 glasses of wine! They do lunch too, and the aquarium allows re-entry!"
4048,2011-07-09,5,i always love going here whenever i can during thanksgiving week. this place is really informative and has great otter exhibits! plus you can always go outside and see the wildlife! cool souvenirs and right on cannery row!
4049,2011-12-02,5,"This place is awesome!  We always enjoy it.  Recently visited Monterey for an overnight stay on a sail boat (with Monterey Bay Sailing)...delightful!  Had our own boat with galley, berth, etc. all to ourselves, followed by an ""Intro to Sailing"" lesson the next day.  This coupled with a visit to the aquarium makes for a tremendously fun and adventurous trip."
4050,2013-08-14,4,"Came here on our vacation with complimentary passes from my employer.  It's truly amazing, so much to see and do.  I love that it makes learning exciting.  The kids loved the touch pools and the splash zone.  We got to (sort of) see the penguin feeding but by then it was getting crowded and amazingly enough all those adults would not let two 3.5' tall kids in front so the kids could see too.... not like they could have possibly blocked anyone's view.  Sadly we ran into that a lot, other tourists, like ourselves, wide eyed and taking it all in but standing right up front being totally inconsiderate of others, and worse, the ones who walk right into (over) you - we've never been so pushed around and stepped on as we were here.  Too crowded.  I understand why and it's not the aquariums fault that people lack basic common courtesy.  sad though, we ended up cutting our day short because I was just done with it (the people, not the aquarium itself)."
4051,2011-08-06,5,"My daughter participated in the Kid's Dive (ages 8-13) a couple of weeks ago.  What an awesome experience.  The staff was excellent and completely professional.  There were plenty of staff on hand to assist in getting the kids into the water in a timely fashion.  The 3-1 ratio was really reassuring too.  My daughter, at 8, was a beginning diver and a little nervous.  This program really eased her mind and confirmed for her that she would like to get her dive certificate one day.  She had the time of her life."
4052,2011-06-11,4,"I have to focus on the acquarium's restaurant in this review.  We spent a very enjoyable morning in the acquarium and then decided to leave for lunch, but realized that the acquarium provides ""fine"" dining (of course, overlooking the Bay) in addition to the deli.  My wife and I had a fabulous meal including clam chowder, seared tuna, roasted artichoke, and mussels tai curry."
4053,2011-05-31,4,"We went to the Aquarium over the Memorial Day weekend. We arrived at 9:30 am on Saturday and suprisingly it wasn't that busy.  The boys loved all the exhibits, but were disappointed that the Shark exhibit was closed. We got the Triple AAA discount which saved us 3.00 per ticket."
4054,2010-05-09,5,"always a great place to visit... I have been many times now, and now that we have a 1.5 year old to entertain, this place never disappoints. suggestions for parents: - if at all possible, visit on a weekday, mid week, even. The crowds are smaller, you can show your child more. - leave the big stroller (bob, bugaboo, uppababy vista) AT HOME. It gets crowded enough in there, you'll maneuver better with an umbrella stroller. - AAA sells advance tickets at their offices, no discount in line. Get them in advance!!! - please, if the space says ""toddlers and infants"", your 5 year old DOES NOT Belong in the space. Remember when your little one was a munchkin and you needed to protect him or her from big old kids? Yeah. I feel that way right now. When your poorly behaved 5 year old is doing his best street fighter kick impression on other kids who are a lot smaller than he..... IT'S time to take control (cough cough, parents of 'jacob').... K thx. - there is water to be splashed. Deal. Bring a change of clothes or two. I'm not a fan of resrticting what a kid can do just bc it's more convenient to not do something (like touching tidepools) so I encourage you to bring a change of clotes. It gets cold out on cannery row. - the portola cafe sells bananas and whole fruit. Yaay. I forgot to pack the bananas but we were able to have a healthy snack. - May 2010... Not a big fan of the flamingo exhibit. I'm not really sure how the flamingos on your right relates to the big plastic cow on your left... After that the exhibit takes a very Earth Day tone, which we didn't really need (recycle, turn off lights, use cfl's, take public transport, eat locally, etc etc.) to 'learn'. Perhaps some naysayers to global warming need to see that exhibit, but californians? It's in our nature now. - the public parking structure is the best deal n parking, first hour is free and 2.50 for every half hour after that. With a small child, you'll likely not be staying too long... So the public lot is likely your best deal. Otherwise you're looking at 15 to 20 day flate rate."
4055,2011-06-03,3,"ok first im  not a water person and  after being in the semi dark  for  90 minutes i was  going crazy. the kids  loved it  and  that  is  what  counts.i took pix  and  did the dog  on thing (tour), this place cost  to much for a group  of 11 and 5 of them are kids,"
4056,2007-06-05,5,"Overall a wonderful place for kids.  The place is huge so plan on spending some time here to fully see everything.  Lots of hands on areas and kids play area.  My girls especially loved the water play area, which offered large bibs so that their clothes stayed nice & dry.  Definitely worth a trip!"
4057,2011-05-22,5,"The only serious reason to consider not going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium is if you can't afford the rather steep cost - $27 for adults if I remember correctly. But we easily spent a full day there, so you can definitely get your money's worth. Extra plus - what I would consider large lockers are available for the whole day for only 50 cents and there is easy exit and re-entry as long as you stamp your hand on the way out."
4058,2013-07-12,2,"We stopped by the aquarium during our vacation in Monterey and I have to say that I was fairly disappointed.  It was quite pricey and the exhibits were not anything that was above and beyond impressive.  The only major things this location had that the Birch Scripps Aquarium in La Jolla doesn't have (at a fraction of the price)  is the sea otters and the touch pools.  The sea otter exhibit was so jam packed that we couldn't even see them (there was only about three on exhibit).  The mola mola (a.k.a. Sunfish) was no longer on display because it had trouble remembering its training.  We took the Behind the Scenes tour for an extra $15 and I was disappointed that we didn't get to see behind more of the exhibits.  You basically get to see the top of the Kelp Forest and then you do get to see the display from the top that has the leopard sharks, seven gill shark, and various fish.  The tour really just shows you the warehouse, their piping system, the veterinarian's office, the outside of the kitchen area with a sample (not actual) menu for the mola mola and the sea otters.  It does offer a brief history of the aquarium and you do get to see what it takes to run the aquarium, but it doesn't necessarily go into great detail about the actual animals.  However, it does explain on their website that this tour is really about what goes on behind the scenes and it is not specifically about the animals.  We also ate a vegetarian burger, hamburger, fries, and macaroni and cheese from the cafeteria.  The macaroni and cheese was so bland that it didn't even taste like cheese.  The fries were good but the burgers were just okay.  Lunch cost us over $40, which was completely overpriced and not even worth the money.  I would recommend packing a lunch and maybe just trying their desserts.  The touch pools were a very cool experience because you are able to touch various starfish, a sea urchin, abalone, bat ray (if you can get it to come to you), and some other static animals.  Unfortunately, the kids generally scared away the bat ray in addition to adults who thought that slapping the water would actually attract the animal to them.  The most frustrating experience, outside of the overpriced tickets and food, is the way that people allow their children to run wild in the aquarium and don't even watch them or correct them when they run you over, shove you out of the way, and bump into you constantly.  The aquarium is also extremely crowded (which is to be expected) so I would recommend getting there when they open at 9:30am and immediately visiting the otters so you can see them clearly.  The feedings will also be jam packed and unless you sit on the floor in front of the exhibit, you won't be able to see much.  The best thing about this experience was being able to look out at the bay and see the seals in their natural habitat.  The funniest part of the day was when we watched the penguin feeding and one particular penguin continually bit at the volunteer's boots and pants and then later bit her right on the bum!  I'm sure she wanted to spray him with the hose she was using to clean the exhibit but she couldn't with all of us as witnesses!  Regardless, he was quite the character and the penguins were very adorable.  They also had a fabulous collection of jellyfish, which they will be removing and replacing with another exhibit soon.  Also, their seahorse exhibit will be removed in the next few months so hurry down to see them if you're a fan.  They change out exhibits frequently and are planning on replacing the seahorses with an octopus exhibit."
4059,2007-12-08,5,"Maybe the best aquarium in the world, based  on what I've read. It's certainly the most respected among aquarium professionals.Keep in mind that there are four big tanks - the Kelp Forest Exhibit, the Outer Bay Exhibit, the Otter Exhibit, plus the one that some people miss, the Monterey Bay Habitats Exhibit, which is kind of tucked away a little bit. (They'll give you a free map.) Plus there are lots of smaller tanks.There are two places where jellyfish can be viewed (see below).The restaurants are very good - a cafeteria and a white tablecloth place.The gift shop is stupendous - allow an hour for this - you'll find something for someone you love, guaranteed. (There's a main gift shop and a couple of branches.)The aquarium has lots of volunteer guides, identifiable by their red blazers - these folks are well trained, friendly, approachable with any and all questions. Based on what I've learned talking with them, many of them are retired folks from the surrounding area who've gone through classes, know their stuff, and love the aquarium passionately. What an asset they are!  Don't miss the aviary. Shorebirds. Amazing. It's a little chilly in this one room (to keep the birds happy); bring a sweater so you can linger. The very best time to visit is late afternoon on a weekday. There's a note of serenity to the place then that's wonderful. Weekday mornings often have school groups - it's noisy - but still, it's fun. Weekends tend to be crowded. Weekends during the summer are very crowded.You can get your hand stamped and get in-and-out privileges for the day.My recommendation for a day:Start in the original wing of the building. This is to the left as you enter. Here you'll find the Kelp Forest Exhibit, the Monterey Bay Habitats Exhibit (right behind the Kelp Forest), the aviary, the touch pool (kids are entranced here, grown-ups like it too). Plenty of other stuff too - for example, the small tanks near the Monterey Bay Habitats Exhibit are keyed to specific aspects of the larger tank. So, walk along the larger tank first, then double back and take in the smaller tanks, then double back again and check out the aviary and touch pool. OK, so that's the original wing. Now head back into the main entry area, the big huge space with very high ceilings. Check out the otters (there are a couple of feeding times during the day; ask a guide for times). Break for lunch in the cafeteria or restaurant, both of which are near the otter exhibit and both of which have lovely views of the bay - you might see a whale-watching boat go by. Then after lunch head over for the newer wing, connected to the older wing by a bridge (fun to walk across) and also steps and an escalator.This wing was built in the mid-90s. First, go downstairs in the new wing, and check out the special exhibits, there are always three or four of these, and they bring new ones in regularly. One of these currently (12/07) is jellies. Then go upstairs for more jellies and the Outer Bay Exhibit which is the biggest tank in the aquarium, one million gallons, holds tuna, barracuda, an incredible ocean sunfish (mola mola) and sometimes a little (i.e., young) Great White Shark, the presence of which is an incredible triumph in aquarist art, or so I understand. There's an upstairs area at the Outer Bay Exhibit where you can sit down - less crowded than the main floor. There's a kid's section tucked near the Outer Bay Exhibit for them to run around. (The aquarium has several kid's sections although the big one is closed for renovations in the winter of '07-'08). After the Outer Bay Exhibit, maybe a bit of shopping, although if you have kids with you, you'll want to be careful, because it's maybe too overwhelming a selection of stuff if they're really young. You can park free all day on the street in neighboring Pacific Grove if you don't mind walking a couple of blocks. To find the free streets, go up from the bay a couple of blocks and into Pacific Grove a little ways. (The aquarium is essentially right on the border between Monterey and Pacific Grove.) As you enter the aquarium, note the little sculpture of David and Lucile Packard, of Hewlett-Packard, who paid for the place. God bless 'em."
4060,2007-05-25,5,"This a must see if your ever visiting our touring in Monterey. I usually hate visiting places that exhibit animals for show but the Aquarium is different. They take pride in their facilities and how they take care of the marine life. They even have special toilets for different flushing types for your # 1 and #2 to save on water! Their exhibits are enormous and educational. I enjoy looking and/or touching the jellyfish, otters, and sting rays. I could spend the rest of the day in the deep sea exhibit. Watching the huge tuna, sunfish, and the sea turtles swim is awe inspiring. I would suggest that if you do not have kids to go and visit during the week because on the weekends all the family come and the kids run around. If you do plan to visit, I suggest that you visit the website mbayaq.org to check out if there will be any special activities on the dates you visit. Also if you are a member (which I am) there are member only activities as well."
4061,2007-02-25,5,"This place is the best aquarium in the world! I have been here so many times and I always leave with a sense of wonder and admiration for the sea. I love how this place focuses mostly on ecosystems of the California coast so I feel very close to the nature all around me. Everything is a must see here, the jellyfish, otters, fish, and sharks. They have some great videos to watch in their auditorium. We saw the Deep Sea video which showed some pretty weird looking deep sea animals. The otters have got to be my favorite though. Try to catch them while they are being fed because they are so cute and playful. I just can't get enough of those otters. They also used to have a great white shark at the aquarium and they said they want to get another one soon. When this happens I am definitely going to go back and visit the aquarium again. This place is just so awesome! A great place for kids and adults!"
4062,2011-07-10,5,"State of the art, one of a kind aquarium. Jellyfish exhibit, open sea exhibit are wonderful.Prepare to spend one full day if it's your first trip. Does get crowded most of the time but which good place does not get packed? Pricey admission so if you plan to go often, get the membership. We usually pack a light lunch and eat at the outdoor space at the aquarium. Wonderful views of the ocean plus the kids get to run free. Will be back again n again."
4063,2007-07-18,5,"After traveling with my family to CA, I'll have to admit, I was not very enthusiastic about leaving the beautiful sunshine and cool weather outside to go walk around in darkish buildings with a bunch of people and look at things that swim.  However, when you travel with other people, sometimes you have to go places you wouldn't necessarily go on your own.  Boy was I glad we went!  Although it was wall-to-wall people, the huge aquariums, exhibits and children's area made it well worth the hassle.  The best thing for me was the kiddy section.  After being stuck in a stroller forever, my 17 month old was thrilled to jump out and play in the water with other kids her age.  A section for babies just her size!  A mom's dream.  i loved being able to watch her interact with other babies while she explored the water, shapes, and water pillow.  She also loved the seal slide and climbing into the huge clam shell.  The kids' section alone made it worth it for me.  Lots of hands-on things that were on her level.  I can't say i'd want to go back, as it was very costly, but if we ever take a trip across the country again, and she's old enough to ask to go, I'd definitely do it all over again."
4064,2010-08-17,4,"Spectacular!  I've been to most of the big aquariums (aquaria?) in the country and while the National Aquarium in Baltimore has it beat, it's probably a strong second.  A family of four will spend well over $100 after parking and tickets, and it's no more than 4 (and probably closer to 3) hours of diversion -- not cheap."
4065,2008-06-29,5,"If you can visit the Aquarium at least twice a year, consider getting a membership -- we have a Family Membership, which works out well for our family of four.  During our visit this month (June 08), we enjoyed the newly renovated Splash Zone (nice job!), the beautiful Jellies exhibit (a family favorite), and also decided to try something new: the Aquarium's ""adventure"" programs.  We tried out the Underwater Explorers (ages 8 - 13) where the kids got to wear ""dry suits"" over their clothing and do surface scuba exploring in the Aquarium's tidepool area -- fabulous!  Also did the Behind-the-Scenes Tour, which was a nice way to escape the crowds and get a sneak peek at how things are done, as well as learn some of the history of the Aquarium -- and we got to feed krill meatballs to the Kelp Forest animals.  Very cool, and at $10/person, I thought it was a very reasonable price for a  special experience.  Finally, we did the Sailing Adventure (Day Sail), where you sail on the bay with about a one-to-one ratio of naturalists/crew/volunteers to guests.  Very educational, and interactive, too!  We saw dolphins, otters, sea lions ... and got a rare chance to see/touch a sunflower star (we knew it was rare, since the whole crew got excited about it!).  A bit pricey, but not when you consider it is a three-hour program.  For my been-to-the-aquarium-many-times kids, these programs gave them a fresh perspective -- we all learned something new this weekend!"
4066,2010-05-24,4,"This was my 2nd trip to the aquarium (but my first trip was over 10 years ago) and man, have things changed there!  It seems like a lot of the exhibits had been updated/remodeled.  This is the biggest aquarium I've ever been to and it had a lot of variety  It was a bit tricky to find everything as the map wasn't that clear, like finding the Hot Pink Flamingo exhibit has to be accessed by going upstairs and back down but not from the main level entrance even though it's also on the main level.  Anyhow, I digress.  There was a kind of odd Seahorse love nest exhibit that made me blush a little but it was kinda kitschy & I laughed.  There was a plethora of gift shops all over the place for your every souvenir craving.  I like that they had a lady handing out Seafood Watch cards for areas all over the US to help us all be better seafood consumers if we opt to eat it.  I carry it around when I'm feeling like sushi.  :)  The otters were adorable and this is a must-see stop for anyone in Monterey.  They have great views of the bay and lots to do for the little ones (an entire wing upstairs is made for tiny people to crawl in holes and play around in).  See the Seahorse love story and try not to cry.  I dare you."
4067,2011-01-28,2,"I took my boyfriend to Monterey Bay Aquarium for his Birthday and was excited to get back.  Afterward i was THOROUGHLY disappointed.  The exhibits that we liked were to small to be interesting for more then 10 minutes, it seemed like a huge chunk of the museum was closed that day.  90 % of what we could do was only interesting to kids under 4 who never appreciate ANY OF IT.  I am not going to blame the Aquarium for the fact that kids can be rowdy, but maybe explain to their parents that they need to keep an eye on their kids?  I had a massively fat child step on me at the sea horse exhibit and his mother didn't even tell him to apologies.  At the feeding all the little babies started screaming and crying and I didn't understand why any of the parents did try and shush them a little.  I just felt like I had wasted my money and time.  I wanted my boyfriend to have a great birthday and instead i was trying to pretend i was having fun."
4068,2010-06-29,5,"When we visited monterey when I was a kid my parents couldn't afford to pay for us to see the aquarium.  That kinda stays with you - I was soooo excited to go see it as an adult and share the joy with my niece and nephew.  What an experience, so much fun, I could have stayed in outer bay all day and watched the big sharks swimming and the jellyfish.  It was a full day experience but well worth it.  Loved every minute of it."
4069,2010-04-19,5,"Perfect place for kids and adults alike. Great exhibits, shows. Nice outdoors. Love it every time we visit."
4070,2008-01-23,4,"Jellyfish, Sea Otters, and Sharks, OH MY! So much animal goodness in one spot and you don't have to worry about getting attacked by a tiger (too soon?). The otters are so adorable and they just play all damn day, but the jellyfish exhibit was my favorite! I never realized how many different jellyfish there were and they have them as babies and adults. I love that you can go outside and look at the gorgeous view and the real tide pool. I was slightly disappointed because I thought the white sharks would be BIG, but alas they were wee little guys. There were these awesome GIANT Tuna though and some other crazy giant fish. I will say it was a little annoying sometimes because I wanted to read the signs that have the pictures of the fish that tell you what they are, but at the big aquariums they are on the floor and there are like a million children sitting all over them. THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS HERE! If you don't like em, then you might be annoyed, but then again I went on a holiday so there might have been a few more people there than normal. It cost me $25 to get in, but it was worth every penny!"
4071,2009-10-03,4,"I like this Aquarium, but its not my favorite. Although its huge, it just doesnt have much diversity to me as the Vancouver or Chicago aquariums. However, I would say that anyone should at least visit once. Admission prices are a bit steep though too. And I just recently got junk mail from the Monterey Bay Aquarium to buy a yearlong pass even though I am sure that I did not give them my address. So please stop spamming me, Monterey Bay Aquarium!"
4072,2009-07-12,5,"Alright heres the deal.  I hadnt been here for like 10 years or so.  When I got here I saw that it was 30 bucks to get in.  I was a little worried.  But from what I remember its worth it and I love the water so lets do it.  I wasnt wrong with remembering that its worth the price!  Everything was awesome, there are plenty of employees to answer questions and an area for the kids, a freshwater area, well actually there is an area for everything and everyone.  I seriously am contemplating coming back on a weekday by myself.  Everything was awesome, nothing about it sucks.  Look- I went July 5th, thats the day after the 4th of july people- a Sunday, am I'm still saying it didnt suck.  So you know its gotta be good.  Every single exibit from the freshwater fish to the jellyfish to the tuna and sharks in the giant tank to the seahorses were awesome.  Take some time out and go here, it is worth every second and every penny."
4073,2009-07-25,4,"Gotta love the aquarium! It is a must if you are visiting the Monterey area, especially if you have youngin's. This place offers an interesting and educational trip for kids and adults alike to learn about local sea life. Their exhibits are fun to look at, and unlike some aquariums that I have been to, you can actually SEE the animals on exhibit. I hate going to a place that has such-and-such animals, then you go and look into their habitats and don't actually see them. At MBA, you get a great view of a bunch of animals. Personally, I liked the penguins and the jellyfish. The ""Secret Lives of Seahorses"" display was very nice as well. So my reason for not giving it 5 stars is because I thought that admission is just a bit pricey. Also, even going in the middle of the week, it was PACKED. You almost have to be aggressive to get up and actually see the fish. I saw and experienced more than one adult shoving their ways through the crowd. Shame on them!"
4074,2010-06-28,5,"I always wanted to come here and I finally got a chance to check this place out today with my boyfriend . This aquarium is amazing but it wasn't as big as I expected . There's a lot of fish , jellyfish , penguins , flamingos , seahorses , sharks , sea stars , and a lot of other sea creatures to look at . There's a really cool leafy sea dragon seahorse that looks like a leaf ( literally ! ) . I loved looking at the jellyfish ... especially the moon jellyfish . They are so beautiful ! There's some things that are hands-on which is nice about this aquarium . You can touch sea stars , abalone , and a few other things which is a nice experience . Everything in the aquarium is presented so nicely ... I love it ! Everything looks so real and you get to see everything clearly up close . The staff is very informative too . You can learn a lot from this aquarium if you stay here for long enough . There are parts of the museum set aside just for the kids to play and learn . There's even a small area where kids 8 - 13 to swim around . Very nice aquarium ... maybe I will be back again someday ."
4075,2008-04-23,4,"lovely place!  the jellyfish are amazing, i'm planning to come during off-hours to lay on the floor and stare at them, as a previous reviewer suggested.  great for photographs too."
4076,2008-06-14,5,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a totally awesome aquarium.  Me and my girlfriend visit once a year and it never seems to bore us.  From jellyfish to otters, sharks to sea horses, or penguins to sea turtles, they have a huge variety of sea life.  They always have something new to see and learn about.  We took a behind-the-scene tour that cost us 10 bucks each.  Though it was short, it was well worth it.  We learned a little history; did you know the aquarium use to be a sardine factory?  We fed raw fish to the Rainbow trout and krill to the sardines in the kelp forest.  We also went to places that wasn't open to the public. (duh! behind-the-scene right?)  Our tour guide was knowledgeable and fun, even though we found out after it was her first tour she has ever done.  So I recommend doing one of these if you ever visit.  I also want to mention that you never know what your going to see if you just look out of the aquarium bay.  We saw dolphins! Wanna go now?"
4077,2010-11-04,4,"i like the aquarium. i know it is very expensive so id suggest looking up the prices and deciding whether or not its worth it to you. but for me it is worth every penny, every time. i try to go here once a year and it is always fun. its a great place to take kids too!"
4078,2008-03-20,4,went here about 7 years ago and thought it was great.  i nice little place to chill.  i'd take a date here.
4079,2009-07-14,5,"Who doesn't love the aquarium!? ""Tuesday, Afternoon""- that Visa commercial always reminds me of the MB Aquarium! :)"
4080,2009-10-26,5,"The aquarium is awesome.  The Outer Bay tank is breathtaking.  I could sit in front of that huge window for hours.  So much to see.  It's easy to spend 6 hours here.  Check out the touch pools. Take advantage of the volunteers to answer your questions.  We ate at the restaurant and it was good, no need to leave for lunch."
4081,2007-05-05,5,"My husband and I have been going to the aquarium for five years now. We just recently became members, since we have a 14 month old. I am in love with this place. Our last visit was May 1. We went to check out the new otter exhibit. It was so awesome. This place never disappoints, no matter how many times you come here , you always find something new . The splash zone is my sons favorite place, mine is the jellies, and my husband loves the outer bay. The staff is friendly and very helpful if you have any questions. I also enjoy the fact that they are trying to preserve the ocean for future generations to enjoy. I believe this is an important cause to help. Being a member has great benefits, i believe everyone should become one. Im looking forward to sleeping over at the aquarium in the next month, just one of the many benefits of being a member. If you havent been here yet, put it on the top of your list. Everyone of all ages will enjoy and afterwards take the 17 mile drive to end a perfect day in Monterey."
4082,2009-04-26,4,"This place was awesome. I loved the different types of sea creatures that they had. I really liked the jelly fishes and the sea horses (they are soooo cute!). It is true that there are a lot of kids, but they were not as unbearable as other yelpers made it seem. It does tend to get crowded, but I noticed that people take a glimpse of whatever they are looking at and then they move on, so you actually do get to get close to whatever it is you want to see. The reason I gave it four stars was because of the price. $30 per adult seems a little steep for an aquarium. I can go to Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo for $25 (with a coupon) and I get shows, animals, and rides."
4083,2009-05-02,4,"i used to love the aquarium about 5 years ago.  there are things i miss, like the fountain.sculpture outside, t he sea turtles in the outer bay,and doc ricketts had a larger section to honer him.  oh, there were way less people and crowds!  sheesh!  you hsvr to fight to get to see the sea otters on the weekends!  but they do have nice new exhibits, the new otter exhibit, the sea horse exhibit, and more interactive things than before,  i also like that the splash zone now has a walkway to connect to the outer bay, so you dont' have to go up, down, and up for your kids!"
4084,2009-06-04,5,"this is a fun place to go.  very educational.  the crowds were a little intense, but what can you expect when there are 958732459834275 field trips going on?"
4085,2009-06-24,2,"Well I don't get why they make a big deal about this aquarium.  This is nothing compared with Academy of Science in San Francisco.  I paid so much here and expect to have many things to see, but it's not.  I will only go here once and will never come back.  Good that they was still have the jelly fish exhibit when I was here, but overall just don't worth it."
4086,2010-08-15,3,"Great place to go with a small group! The so-called coupons though are pathetic. I searched all over the internet to find some way to save money. The best that one can find is like 5 dollars off or so, which still makes for an extremely expensive visit. I love the interactive exhibits and how every time I come back there is something new. If perhaps the deals were better, maybe those returns could be more frequent."
4087,2011-01-26,5,"We drove out to visit the Aquarium all the way from Arizona and were not disappointed in the least. As other Yelpers have previously mentioned, the ultra-propagandized sections were rather in-your-face and I personally found most of them to repulse rather than propagate the conservationist view. We did feel the exhibits overall to be very well maintained, staffed with caring charismatic folks and innovatively creative in design at times. No doubt about it, Monterey Bay's Aquarium FAR surpasses Sea World any day. I would definitely not be opposed to returning again sometime in the future. There are a lot of exhibits specifically tailored to the kids and the place is huge so be prepared to walk and walk and walk. Hey, but that's part of the experience too! Educational, fun, interesting, beautiful and thought provoking are all appropriate words I would use to describe this great place. A definite DO!"
4088,2010-08-09,4,the aquarium is such an amazing place. It's HUGE. they have so many sea creatures..it's awesome.
4089,2009-03-23,4,had a great time here sunday afternoon. there was plenty to keep us busy for a few hours. i especialy liked the kelp forest and the jellies.
4090,2009-05-25,4,Nice place to learn a lot about marine life. It isn't a big place and hence will certainly be crowded during the weekends and holidays. But the place has a lot of variety and takes a good part of the day to complete.
4091,2009-06-01,5,i love coming here. my fiancee and i came here when we first started dating. we like to come back every so often and we always have a good time. the sunfish is one of my favorites as well as the jelly fish. its clean and although its usually busy its a very good aquarium.
4092,2009-12-29,5,"Fabulous.  We've been to lots of acquarium's around the country and this exceeds all of them by far. If you're going to go more than once a year, consider the membership.  They let you in early.  Great way to see your favorite exhibits without the crowds."
4093,2010-07-07,5,"If you haven't been, you really need to! Go see this museum of the world largest echosystem!!!"
4094,2009-02-21,5,this was my husband & i's second trip to an aquarium. It was a great experience!! we came here early to beat the crowd and it was actually cool. the weather was good at this time (summer '07)..& lots of kids! what do you expect.. this aquarium was definitely made for families. i actually learned a lot of things here!
4095,2010-01-10,2,"The only part I enjoyed was the sea otters. so cute!!! honestly, this place is small and over priced.  Check out the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. For $16.95 ($10.95 for children) you can experience not only sharks, but reptiles and many other sea animals. The place is huge!"
4096,2010-03-22,5,"Amazing place for everyone. It might be too crowded on weekend but still I don't regret driving *+ hrs. from San DIego just to see this place with mi two kids (3-4) and nephew (6yr). The have the best aquarium in California and the staff is very nice and kind.  My son wanted to see squids and they helped me out finding them and even gave us a tour with a scientist. It was a wonderful experience. The little ones loved it and want to go back, even after so much driving."
4097,2008-10-10,4,Fun Fun Fun many thinggs to do and a lot of things stufffed in there . Being a chaperone for a field trip omj! it was 10:30 and i felt like i was in Dinseyland (ok not THAT crowded) but there is alot of fishies and jelly fish and sharks (no Great Whites though) sad sad only the ones with the scary nose though. And adorable seals and stuff outside! BE AWARE: Its like 0 degrees there outside! Inside i was warm though
4098,2009-02-21,5,"Just as great as an adult!  As one magazine bragged, this one-of-a-kind place is one of the top 10 places to see before your tenth birthday!  The kids loved every inch of the place.  Touch this, watch that, have fun, learn something.  My family will be back.  Want a great day's nature experience?  Hit MBA in the morning and then head up the coast to Ano Nuevo State Park to see the elephant seals."
4099,2009-06-05,5,i recently went to the aquarium during spring break in april and it was great.  there was a lot to see there.  you definitely can spend the whole day there.  arrive early before the place fills up.  the lines move pretty well to get tickets.  the best exhibits are the outer ocean exhibits and the jelly fish(which i believe is its trademark).  be sure to visit the tide pool exhibit and go out onto the balcony for some great picture opportunities.
