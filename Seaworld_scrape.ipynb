      "I first came here for a field trip way back in kindergarten, and I remember being enchanted by all the sea life surrounding me, to stare up at the tanks and watch all the fish and sharks swim past me with all the beautiful blue light, and leave the aquarium with an octopus plushie. My boyfriend brought me here for a birthday outing, so this was my first time back as an adult. Just as I felt when I was a kid, we were both enchanted by the marine life. If we lived close to Monterey, we would definitely get a membership here! It's so relaxing and uplifting to walk through the aquarium and enjoy the tranquility of the sea life. It was fascinating to see the sea otters, the reefs, and the jellyfishes and octopus. Such a relaxing and wonderful way to spend the afternoon. \n",

      "I visited Monterey Bay Aquarium for the first time the Sunday of President's Day weekend. We got there around 10:45am after parking in the Cannery Row garage ($15 for the whole day, no hourly). I'm really glad I purchased my tickets in advance because the line to buy tickets at the door was super long! However the advance ticket line was short and moved very quickly. They do check your bags at the door so be prepared for that.The aquarium was PACKED that day. I guess I should have expected that there'd be a ton of young childen but it still surprised me. I hadn't been to an aquarium in probably a decade so I was ready to enjoy my day strolling around and admiring the  animals. However it was definitely difficult to get a good view at certain times because the exhibits were really full, and the feedings were always very full and hard to see. I wish there were more screens so everyone in the back could see. Sometimes the exhibits got super stuffy/smelly as well with all the people :(My favorites were the giant octopi, puffins, and jellies. Seeing green eels was really cool too. I loved feeling like an excited kid again. The volunteers are also really knowledgeable and friendly and willing to answer questions. The touch tanks were cool but they mostly just had seaweed/kelp, and the stingrays were all hiding from the people, though I don't blame them. Unfortunately the Tentacles exhibit was closed. I wish I could've seen more octopi or cuttlefish.Around 1pm we stepped out to grab lunch, since they have an in and out policy. Just stamp your hand before you leave and you can enter again later.At $50 a ticket for adults at an aquarium geared toward young children, it's definitely a little pricey. If it's not super busy I think you could get through almost everything in 4 hours, unless you want to watch all the auditorium videos too. However I love supporting animal welfare and research so I think it's well worth it, especially if you haven't been! \n",

      "I came here for my first time in 2005 and it was AMAZING! Like seriously over the top mind blowing.  There was a Chihuly exhibit in the jellyfish area and it was spectacular.  Maybe that is what made this last trip fall in comparison?  I went for the day with some friends and it was meh at best in my humble opinion (January 2020).  I'm not a huge fish tank person; I appreciate nature in general and see the value of a spot like this for people to learn and get up close to so many species we'd otherwise never be able to get close to see in person.  It was very busy, I don't have kids, and they were all over the place like little wild animals.  It was sensory overload for me I guess.  The fish were cool, otters the best, and of course the view is lovely.  Maybe going on a Saturday was a mistake, and later in the day no less.  The jellyfish area is still cool, but compared to the exhibit in 2005 where it was at least 3 times the size it was OK at best.  It's hard not to compare, so my opinion is clearly skewed.  Some of my friends LOVED it during our January visit, but I ended up leaving early with another couple friends and heading up the street for a drink and to enjoy a kid free space.  I'm glad I went but I guess I'm cool for another 15 years, lol. \n",

      "Great place to go for groups of all ages!  Note they no longer offer a AAA discount (as of Jan 2020) but they do offer military, veteran and student (with ID) discounts.  We had our family group of 5 for my husbands birthday on a Saturday.  It was busy but not too crowded.  We made it to a great video presentation in the auditorium and saw the feeding time for the penguins.  Fun!  The displays are beautifu!. I think my favorite are thee jelly fish.  I lingered there thee longest.  Another favorite spot is the outdoor tidal area they have plenty of space to sit outside and rest your feet, get some fresh coastal air and take in the view before resuming your tour \n",

      "Cool place to visit. It has been on my bucket list for 20 some years. ... it was better in my mind :).It costs about 50bucks for an adult ticket. It is actually smaller than I expected, way smaller. There are plenty of exhibits to keep you easily busy for 5 hours. There are a few live video presentations. For the rambunctious kid there are two petting ponds and a mini jungle gym to tire them out. A restaurant too... which I thought was odd given the size of the aquarium. Also, I counted 3 seperate shops (or 4) which were again, too many.   Put more aquariums....I did like that it gave attention to the small marine life by their use of lightning, aquarium magnifying effects, and in a few occasions u can interact with the aquarium by either introducing light or water current.There are a few large aquariums... I wanted to see the Sun Fish. The largest fish I saw was about the size of a man. My favorite section was the octopus aquariums.Personally I thing the aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is better. The outside beach view at Monterey Bay Aquarium has no equal... it is gorgeous BUT you can see that view all around Monterey Bay anyway.... I wonder if they could build an underwater walkway out into the bay... about 1000feet at least... that would be amazing.Either way, if you come to Monterey Bay, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a cool spot to visit. \n",

      "What a great Aquarium! I can't believe I haven't been here before, and I live so close too! My family and I had a blast here. First, we went to the Otter feeding and we found that very interesting. If you want to watch this feeding I recommend getting there right at opening, it gets crowded and makes viewing hard. Also, make sure you are on the mezzanine level, we found out you don't get to see much from the lower lever. It is still pretty cool however and they provide tv screens showing you what's going on above if you do get stuck down here as we did. The real highlight of the trip however was The Open Sea feeding, it was breathtaking. There really wasn't a bad seat either, they really have crowd control down for this show. It was really spectacular watching all the fish swarm the food, especially the sardines.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is as good as it gets as far as Aquariums go, there really isn't much more to say about it that hasn't already been said. Definately worth your time. \n",

      "Got a 2 day pass.  If you don't want to wait in long lines, get your tickets ahead of time!  Aquarium closes at 5pm.  Came in around 3pm and it was plenty of time for us to see everything in the aquarium.  We Liked having the photo opportunity towards the end cause most of the crowds cleared out and we took advantage of the open spaces. Huge fan of the Jelly Fish exhibits, sea otters, Kelp Forrest and the tropical fishes.  I really liked that they placed an exhibit about the trash that is endangering our oceans. We need to take better care of our oceans and having more awareness of the beautiful wonderful creatures that live there.  So many families and great educational exhibits and experience for the youth.  Perfect place for a date or a family field trip.  Be kind to each other, help others take selfies, don't trash our oceans and recycle!! \n",

      "It's hard to offer anything but praise to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, with its commitment to research, conservation, public education on sustainable fishing practices, and hands on interaction with sea life.As a scuba diver, their walls of underwater life come as close to approximating the feeling of being twenty feet under the water as you'll find outside of grabbing a wetsuit and your oxygen tank.  From  education, to hands on experimentation in the touch tidepool areas, to committed volunteers and workforce, clearly this is a world class facility.It is also an expensive proposition at $50 a person ($40 for students), which can be cost prohibitive and create an access issue for some families. While I realize the money for admission goes back to support their mission, facilities, and talented staff, the level of crowding on busy days seems to be a weak link, making it difficult to navigate through the relatively small facility, vis a vie the crowd size.  They'd benefit from a reservations system and capping the crowds here, as on the day we attended crowds outpaced the capacity of their facility, impacting  the enjoyment and experience of their guests. \n",

      "A premier aquarium showcasing sea life from the Monterey Bay situated right off shore the California coast.  What makes The MBA so unique?  How about a deep underwater valley right off shore that brings rich deepwater nutrients and plankton right to the surface.   Thus the abundance of sea life close to shore.For you movie buffs, the aquarium was the setting for the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home released in 1986.  The Star Trek crew was tasked to bring two Humpback Whales to space... wIld...So you want to visit?  There is free residential parking south towards Pacific Grove, metered street parking close by, or pay parking lots a few blocks away.  If you park near Pacific Grove, you'll walk by sea lions lounging in a protective cove immediately south of the aquarium.Favorite Exhibits:- Two Story Kelp Forest Exhibit, large Kelp plants swaying with the current with large and small fish at different depths, seawater pumped and filtered from offshore- Open Ocean Tank, open deep sea fish tank that has previously housed a Great White Shark, Tiger Shark, Hammerhead Sharks, Large Sea Turtles, and rare Ocean Sunfish.  Lots of open water fish.  They had to release the sharks in the past as they kept crashing into spots where they detected an electrical anomaly- Ocean Jellies, jelly fish of all kinds...mesmerizing - Puffin Exhibit, those sea birds swim fast and crazy- Bat Ray Touch Pool, you can touch if they come near you- Two Story Sea Otter Exhibit, saw four in the tank, you can see some in the wild from the aquarium balcony- Enclosed Beach Aviary, rescued sea birds and surf fishAnd more...Plan on at least 3 hours at the MBA. \n",

      "The whole reason why we decided to drive out to SF was to stop by Monterey for this Aquarium. Beware you have to work a bit far and walk down, I think parking was around $15 in a garage nearby.Admission is a bit pricey around $50 per adult. But we heard such great things about it we had to check it out. Holy Moly this place is amazing!!!! Huge I mean humongous tanks of colorful fish, sharks, sea turtles and everything else you can imagine under the sea, 2 floors of packed fun and kids play space, indoor cafeteria, and an outdoor ocean view. We loved it! My favorite was def the open sea and jelly fishes. Truly an amazing experience and highly recommended.Also, once done, you can walk down the street to the beach area and come great restaurants with amazing views! \n",

      "I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! When I used to live in Santa Cruz, this was a go to destination for me. I would love to just stand in front of the kelp forest and get lost in the motions. The sea otters and penguins are fun to watch. The deep ocean with the hammerhead sharks, sun fish, tuna, some times a sea turtle...I also enjoy their special exhibits. This time around, we went to the Tentacles exhibit and looked at the octopus, garden eels, and other mesmerizing creatures. My niece and nephew loved the touch pool where they could touch seaweed, sea grass, kelp, sea urchin, sea stars and abalone shells. They have hand sanitizer and paper towels to clean your hands with afterwards. If you are a member, you can use the member entrance for a quicker entry. Members also can enter normally an hour earlier than the general public. Make sure that you stamp your hand so that you can re-enter. They will check your hand with black light. You will need to park in a public lot or on the street since they do not have onsite parking. They do have a cafe if you're hungry. They also have gift shops with cute stuffed animals, books, mugs, keychains, glass sculptures, etc. \n",

      "This is my happy place.The Monterey Bay Aquarium is by far the best aquarium I've been to in California. I've gone here ever since I was a little girl, and will continue to go for years to come. The aquarium have a vast variety of sea life stemming from the tiniest of microorganisms all the way to gigantic sunfish. There is always something for every aquatic lover to enjoy.My favorite part of this aquarium is the open sea exhibit. There is a bottom layer and you can also seat yourself higher in the \"bleachers\" to gaze at the schools of fish and occasional shark roaming by. Tip; if you are a student, tickets are discounted from the usual $49.95 to $39.95, so always bring that ID when getting your tickets! \n",

It's probably best for kids over the age of 5 - not that younger kids won't enjoy it, but it's pricey for littler attention spans.  That said, they have feedings of various animals at regular times as well as 15 minute videos in their auditoriums that help break up the day.  The cafe is also surprisingly good.  Note: bring your own mug if you want to get coffee because they don't have take away cups (low waste - hooray!!). \n",

I live in Illinois now, but always see the Aquarium every time I go home. Always new exhibits and the staff is always enthusiastic and helpful. I even lost my wallet while I was there last time and they held it for me until I came back and claimed it. The jellyfish exhibit has only gotten better and the entire place looks like it got a great makeover. My favorite is the shows they offer several times day about the history of the Monterey Bay, and its fisherman. \n",

Lots of new facts about the residents of the ocean and wonderful to learn about the conservation efforts undertaken. We were 2 adults and it took us about 3 hours to finish seeing the exhibits. If you include the movies, it'll probably take you another 1-1.5 hours. Book your tickets online to avoid standing in line which was pretty long when we got there. Also, if you're going to partake discounts/promos, they recommend online tickets as they don't accept those at on-site booking. Parking is in the public parking lot $15 for the day. Would recommend that or just cabbing it as street parking is tough and only for 2 hours. \n",
